      "Tina O'Brien's new boyfriend has been revealed as a millionaire who has links to Manchester United.",
      "The Coronation Street actress, 41, was married to personal trainer Adam Crofts but just four months on from their split, she has been linked to a design guru who has worked for footballer Paul Pogba. Adam Fadle, 38, refurbished the sports star's luxury home in Cheshire shortly after he signed for his team, and his home appears as part of a portfolio on the Panoramic Properties website.",
      "A description on the website reads: \"Panoramic Properties Limited was founded in 2010 by Adam Fadlé and has grown over the years into an award-winning interior design studio.",
      "\"Originally graduating with a degree in architecture, Adam specialised in the luxury interior design sector, where his passion and creative flair came into its own.",
      "“Continuing to build on the company's success over the years and push the boundaries in design, Panoramic Properties is now proudly recognised internationally as one of the leading design studios in the industry.",
      "\"High end interior design has always been at the heart of Panoramic Properties. Our team of talented designers work with both end clients and developers to produce world class homes.\"",
      "According to insiders, Tina, who was married to the original Adam for six years and has a son with him, had simply fallen \"out of love\" with her husband and \"fallen in love\" with another man of the same name.",
      "Speaking to the Sun, they added: \"Tina looked totally mad for Adam and they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.\"",
      "Friends also claimed Tina had \"grew apart\" from her ex, Adam, who she had met in 2011. “Tina and Adam are on good terms, they’re still close and are committed to being a family, even if they’re not together,\" a source claimed.",
      "Tina was cast as Sarah Platt on Coronation Street in 1999, and saw the character through numerous storylines including her infamous teenager pregnancy and her mother Gail Platt's marriage to serial killer Richard Hillman.",
      "She quit the serial in 2007 and had small stints in Waterloo Road and Call the Midwife but ultimately returned to her signature role in 2015, and has remained on-screen ever since.",
      "During her first stint, Tina struck up a relationship with co-star Ryan Thomas, who played her character's then-boyfriend Jason Grimshaw, and they went on to have daughter Scarlett, 16, together.",
      "But they called it quits in 2009 after six years together, and Ryan went on to have Roman, five, and three-year-old Lilah with TOWIE's Lucy Mecklenburgh, to whom he is engaged.",
      "However, Tina and Ryan were far from co-parenting blissfully by 2022, when the actress reportedly smashed Ryan's Range Rover wing mirror with a baseball bat after the pair became embroiled in a furious row.",
      "The alleged incident occurred in March 2022 when Tina stepped out of a friend's party to confront Ryan as he arrived on the scene. It's alleged that subsequently, his Range Rover was targeted with a baseball bat, leading to scratched paintwork and a \"smashed off\" wing mirror."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo Jr has brutally put down Lamine Yamal by saying the Barcelona sensation still has a long way to go before reaching his dad’s level. Ronaldo Sr, currently playing for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, is widely considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time.",
      "The 40-year-old’s incredible career has seen him shatter countless records while playing for the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. He is currently closing in on becoming the first footballer ever to reach 1000 officially registered professional goals.",
      "Yamal, meanwhile, is arguably the best and most exciting talent in the world right now, having lit up European football over the past few seasons with Barcelona and Spain.",
      "The winger, who celebrated his 18th birthday in controversial fashion last week, is among the favourites to win his first Ballon d’Or this year – which Ronaldo has won five times.",
      "Given Yamal’s recent heroics in La Liga, the Champions League and 2024 European Championships, it is understandable that many younger fans consider him a better player than the veteran Ronaldo, who is now considered past his peak.",
      "That view was clear to see in a recent Twitch stream with American creator 2xRaKai, who was travelling in a car with 15-year-old Ronaldo Jr. During the stream, the teenager was asked to name his favourite footballer of all time, to which he instantly replied: “My dad.”",
      "The streamer then took a swipe at Ronaldo Jr by stating Yamal was better than his dad. The Portuguese legend’s son agreed based on their current ability but made it clear that Yamal is still a long way off matching Ronaldo’s stellar career.",
      "He replied: \"Right now? Yes, but Lamine hasn’t won anything yet. He’s very good, but he still hasn’t won anything.\"",
      "Despite Ronaldo Jr's claims, Yamal enjoyed a highly successful 2024/25 season, winning a domestic treble of La Liga, the Spanish Super Cup and Copa del Rey. He also won Euro 2024 with Spain last summer.",
      "He scored 18 goals and assisted a further 25 in 55 appearances in all competitions last season, while Ronaldo had scored only five goals in 19 Sporting CP appearances at the same age.",
      "But while he has no shortage of talent, he would have to continue his current trajectory over the next decade and beyond to match Ronaldo’s legacy and long list of accolades, which include five Champions League trophies and being the all-time leading goal-scorer in international football.",
      "Ronaldo also came out on top when he met Yamal in the 2025 Nations League final clash between Spain and Portugal last month, scoring in a 2-2 draw which Portugal won on penalties.",
      "Yamal is much closer in age to Ronaldo Jr than the footballing legend himself and there is a chance that the two teenagers could share the field in the future.",
      "Ronaldo Jr is an aspiring professional footballer in his own right, currently playing in Al-Nassr’s youth academy. He previously trained with Juventus, Manchester United and Real Madrid during his father’s time with each club.",
      "The youngster was born in the United States and was also able to represent Spain but decided to play for Portugal at youth level, following in his dad’s footsteps. He made his debut for Portugal’s Under-15s against Japan in May and scored his first two goals against Croatia just days later.",

      "The Argentina international, who was available for sale in January, was told to find a new club by the Portuguese head coach after Garnacho was publically critical of the decision to not select him to start in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. As a result, Garnacho has not been part of United's pre-season plans.",
      "Instead the winger — along with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho — has been told he can report to Carrington for training from 5pm, after the first team have completed their training. Thus far, United have not been able to facilitate a transfer for any of the players they want to sell.",
      "Villa have registered their interest in Garnacho, according to the Mail. Chelsea and Tottenham are also said to be monitoring the 21-year-old's situation, who prefers to remain in the Premier League.",
      "United previously valued Garnacho at £70m but that figure may prove difficult to earn given the public fallout of the winger's situation at United. But any fee will provide pure profit for the club in terms of profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Garnacho pictured himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt last month. The young star sparked some controversy when he wore a Rashford top, prompting the ire of some supporters.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa Park, but ultimately did not see the option to make the move permanent activated. The United academy product scored four goals and added six assists in 17 appearances in the Midlands.",
      "Unai Emery's side had a £40m agreement in place with United to seal Rashford's transfer but it ultimately did not come to fruition. The forward instead wants a move that could offer Champions League football, with Barcelona said to be his dream destination.",
      "The Catalan side are said to be more interested in signing Rashford on loan. The England international's contract until 2028, that sees him earn £315,000-per-week could prove problematic to an exit.",
      "Speaking ahead of his loan, Rashford admitted he was keen to find a new club. \"For me, personally, I think I’m ready for a new challenge and the next steps,\" he said.",
      "\"When I leave it’s going to be “no hard feelings”. You’re not going to have any negative comments from me about Manchester United. That’s me as a person.",

      "The United academy graduate is tipped to leave Old Trafford this summer after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim. He was loaned out to Aston Villa for the second half of the season, but Unai Emery's side opted against making his move a permanent one.",
      "Rashford is now weighing up his options and those close to him understand that the dream scenario would see him head to the Nou Camp. The Spanish club are considering a swoop having missed out on some of their other targets this summer.",
      "Nico Williams chose to remain at Athletic Bilbao whilst Liverpool are determined not to sell Luis Diaz - which could see them turn their attention to the United outcast. Sheringham though doesn't believe Rashford's behaviour has warranted a move to one of Spain's giants.",
      "The player's attitude and off-field antics were called out by previous manager Erik ten Hag, who previously dropped him on several occasions. Amorim was also quick to highlight issues with Rashford, airing concerns with his application at training.",
      "Sheringham told Sky Bet: “If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you’re there, you appreciate it. You don’t throw it away and say you want to leave. I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "\"To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out – I didn’t like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn’t get the move that he’s hankering for. From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that’s a step up that he hasn’t deserved.”",
      "United and Rashford are keen to part ways in a move that would suit all parties. He is one of a number of major names, earning big wages, who the club want to get off their books. The player has returned for pre-season but is training on his own at Carrington.",
      "Rashford has proved to be a devastating player in the final third when on form, previously hitting 30 goals in a season, but he's remained hugely inconsistent. Barcelona though may feel he can further their attacking quality if they can get him back to his best."

      "Sporting CP's players were reportedly unsurprised by Viktor Gyokeres' absence from their pre-season training camp in the Algarve. It now seems only a matter of time before the Swedish striker completes a transfer to long-time admirers Arsenal.",
      "The race to sign Gyokeres, who has scored a staggering 97 goals in only 102 games for his Portuguese employers, has been the talk of the summer transfer window, with both the Gunners and Premier League rivals Manchester United keen to bolster their forward lines.",
      "Gyokeres supposedly turned his nose up at the idea of reuniting with Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, and now, after he failed to return for Sporting's pre-season preparations this week and remains missing from their Algarve training camp, reports suggest his representatives are in London to seal a £69million move.",
      "Arsenal ambitiously hope a transfer can be completed by the end of this week, so the 27-year-old may join Mikel Arteta's side on their pre-season tour of Singapore.",
      "The Swede's training snub landed him in hot water, and he has since been slapped with a hefty fine and forced to apologise to his team-mates. However, it seems as though his peers saw this absence coming.",
      "Portuguese outlet A Bola reports that Gyokeres' potential exit has not been discussed openly within Sporting's cohort. However, many of the club's players anticipated the striker missing their pre-season in light of his potential Premier League switch.",
      "Sporting's coach, Rui Borges, is also thought to have expected Gyokeres to be absent from his plans for the upcoming season, and he has been preparing accordingly.",
      "Even the club's president, Frederico Varandas, admitted that it is incredibly likely Gyokeres will depart this summer, with the Emirates now looking like his new home.",
      "\"If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave,\" Varandas admitted last month. \"In the last few weeks, we have been keeping an eye on the market. I saw a player like Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for £56m.",
      "\"I saw two players being sold in the Premier League, Matheus Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, forwards who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion. [They] were sold for around £65m. We are talking about players who are 26 years old.",
      "\"So, given the demands we make in relation to Viktor's value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.\"",
      "While Gyokeres seems likely to wear an Arsenal shirt next season, further reports from Portugal suggest that a dispute over add-ons has halted negotiations. Sporting want the add-ons to be 'easily achieved', but the Gunners are supposedly resisting, and both clubs are currently at odds over this stipulation.",

      "In recent seasons, United have been blighted by numerous missteps in the transfer market, with a string of expensive signings failing to live up to their price tags. The club is trying to move on some of those misfits to fund fresh arrivals and maintain headroom when it comes to PSR restrictions.",
      "Only Matheus Cunha has arrived from Wolves this summer, while exhaustive talks with Brentford over another striker, Bryan Mbeumo, continue after at least two rejected bids. To add insult to injury, United have seen two players they let go relatively cheaply flourish and go on to secure big-money transfers elsewhere.",
      "Anthony Elanga, 23, who United sold to Nottingham Forest for £15million two years ago, has just joined Newcastle United in a £55m deal. Elanga made 55 appearances for United but was deemed surplus to requirements by then-head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "United did retain an interest in the Swedish winger in the form of a sell-on fee related to profit, which means they will reportedly net £6million. While that is a useful sum, United may have been the club reaping the benefits of his potential instead of a direct rival.",
      "Another ex-United player is on the move, Alvaro Carreras, who has left Benfica for Real Madrid in a deal worth £43m. The left-back, 22, was previously part of Real's youth set-up before joining United in 2020.",
      "However, again under Ten Hag's watch, he was allowed to leave for Benfica, initially on loan, before sealing a permanent move for just £5m. United's interest was retained in two ways: a sell-on fee related to profit and a buy-back option, reports Fabrizio Romano.",
      "United opted not to trigger the buy-back clause, although they are said to have received around £7.6m as part of Real’s purchase. Again, United’s decision not to keep or trigger their buy-back option now looks questionable, given that he now resides with the 15-time European champions.",
      "Meanwhile, with just a month to go before the start of the Premier League season, Mbeumo remains a Brentford player, with the two clubs seemingly no closer to striking a deal. United are believed to have offered in excess of £60m - £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons.",
      "However, the Bees are said to be demanding a fixed fee that surpasses the £62.5m that United paid Wolves for Cunha. The inpass adds to the frustration of Amorim, who is eager to get as much business done as soon as possible so he can integrate new players into his squad during an intense pre-season campaign. The Red Devils begin their Premier League campaign against last season's runner-up, Arsenal, on Sunday, August 17.",

Ratcliffe has gone to extreme lengths to save money since taking full control of football operations after buying a share in the club.",
      "That includes scrapping staff lunchboxes, cancelling a staff Christmas party and axing Sir Alex Ferguson's ambassadorial deal. United have also had several rounds of redundancies and some of the staff who were cut have now joined Tottenham.",

      "The report states that Florence Lafaye, who briefly succeeded Timpson after she left the club, is also involved with Altius8. And Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is said to be hopeful that they can 'have the same transformative effect on the club's revenues as the team did at United.'",
      "The report also claims that those within the industry believe Altius8's involvement at Tottenham could cause embarrassment for Ratcliffe after 'dismantling what was one of the few unqualified successes of the Glazer era'.",
      "However, Ratcliffe has repeatedly defended the cost-cutting and claimed that United would have gone bust by the end of the year if they had not made cuts. \"I don't enjoy reading the newspaper very much these days I have to say,\" Ratcliffe told BBC Sport in March.",

      "Manchester United are set to bank a handy fee of around £7million after their former player Alvaro Carreras completed his move to Real Madrid. Carreras spent four years on the books at United and never made a first-team appearance – yet he has proven useful now.",
      "Carreras joined United as a 16-year-old from Real in 2020, but left after growing frustrated by the lack of first-team opportunities. After loans at Preston and Granada, he impressed on loan at Benfica, who paid around £5m to make his move permanent last summer.",
      "United wisely decided to insert buy-back and sell-on clauses in that deal with Benfica, and while they opted not to re-sign the 22-year-old left-back, they have benefited from the other clause.",
      "That’s because Real have now confirmed the signing of Carreras on a six-year contract for a fee of around €50m (£43m). United are due 20 per cent of that – around £7.2m.",
      "Real have paid that amount after Carreras contributed four goals and five assists in 52 matches for Benfica last season. He spent time in Real’s academy in the past and will now play on the opposite side of defence to Trent Alexander-Arnold in Xabi Alonso’s side, competing with Ferland Mendy for a place in the starting XI.",
      "The money will come in handy for United, who are about to shell out over £60m to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, having also paid £62.5m for Matheus Cunha. United have also banked £6m from Anthony Elanga’s £55m move from Nottingham Forest to Newcastle from a similar clause.",
      "United could have decided to bring Carreras back for just £16m last year, but decided against it, with Tyrell Malacia and Luke Shaw on the books. They later signed Patrick Dorgu in January to add options on the left side of defence.",
      "Speaking at the time, former United boss Erik ten Hag said: “I think the process is perfect. We loan him to Preston, he got back, then we loan him to Granada, he didn't play so much there, and of course we, all the time, observed him and now we had the opportunity to sell him.",
      "\"But we have a buy-back [clause] so we have control of the situation, I think that's what he needed.",
      "“From Preston, then go to La Liga, go to Portugal [with Benfica], every time stepping up to a higher club and a better league. Now we have to see and assess the situation if he can be an option for us. But playing at Man United is not so easy, playing in the Premier League for Manchester United is not so easy. You need experience, also development. You get development from playing for better clubs and in better leagues.”"

      "Brentford have dropped a major hint that Bryan Mbeumo’s protracted transfer to Manchester United could finally be about to go through.",
      "United have been chasing Mbeumo for weeks, but have come up against a determined resistance from Brentford, who have refused to budge over their asking price. The Bees have rejected two offers from United for the Cameroon international, who they believe is worth at least £63million.",
      "Brentford have seen United pay £62.5m for Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Anthony Elanga go from Nottingham Forest to Newcastle for £55m and are playing hard ball over their most prized asset. Nevertheless, the club are not blind to the fact that Mbeumo wants to leave and they have begun making contingency plans.",
      "The Evening Standard reports that they have identified Ipswich Town star Omari Hutchinson as a replacement for Mbeumo, although they have yet to make contact. Hutchinson only joined Ipswich from Chelsea last summer in a club-record deal worth £22.5m, but could be set to leave a year later.",
      "He got three goals and two assists in 31 appearances last season as Ipswich were relegated and reportedly prefers the idea of moving back to London. Chelsea have a buy-back clause, but are unlikely to stand in Brentford’s way, given they have already signed wingers Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian from Borussia Dortmund and Palmeiras respectively this summer.",
      "Brentford have already lost manager Thomas Frank to Tottenham – replacing him with Keith Andrews – and captain Christian Norgaard, who joined Arsenal, and are now facing the possible departures of Mbeumo and striker Yoane Wissa. But the west London side have developed a reputation for shrewd work in the transfer market.",
      "Hutchinson is still only 21 years old and scored in the final as England under-21s beat Germany 3-2 in the under-21 Euros in the summer. He wants to play Premier League football next season and would relish the chance to replace Mbeumo, who got 20 league goals on the right wing in 2024/25.",
      "“Let’s see on that. I think our position is that he had an unbelievable season last season, we expected interest in him. If that deal’s right, there’s a deal to do, if not then he stays. We’ve spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It’s not a given that he’s going to depart this summer. There is interest.",
      "“He had a great season last season so it’s inevitable there’s going to be interest in him. If we get the right offer, there’s potentially a deal to be done but there’s only so much we can say on that.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "As long as Manchester United go without recruiting a striker, more undesirable names will be linked with them. The latest is Nicolas Jackson.",
      "Chelsea must be revelling in that. Two dates have been chiselled onto their honours' board, they beat United to Liam Delap, bolstered their attack with Joao Pedro, have tried to flog Christopher Nkunku to United and now Jackson has been bracketed with them.",
      "Jackson was widely pilloried after he was sent off in the Club World Cup. In his first season in London, he was mentioned in the same breath as another Premier League newbie, Rasmus Hojlund. He should be a non-starter for that reason alone.",
      "United cannot remotely entertain taking a busted flush off Chelsea's hands. They are nowhere near as keen on Nkunku as Chelsea have tried to suggest and Jackson is less attractive.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "Every Tom, Dick and Harry who plays up front is cropping up in the United gossip columns. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is a free agent that Everton are better off without yet United's striker strife is so acute there is speculation about a possible move for him.",
      "Apart from sorry Southampton, every Premier League side last season had a better striker than United. Go through the table and 18 clubs had a more rounded frontman than Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Such reports are not of United's own making but they have given the impression that Delap was the only duck they had lined up as their new starting striker. It suited them to be linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike but there was nothing concrete. Both are bound for Premier League clubs that qualified for the Champions League.",
      "United might have edged Chelsea for Delap had they left Bilbao with the Europa League trophy among their hand luggage. United, reeling from their worst season in 51 years and with no European football on offer, are a tough sell to strikers.",
      "Thirty goals in two seasons is not the pedigree of striker United require. Jackson is neither prolific nor proven. He was red-carded twice within six weeks at the tail-end of Chelsea's campaign and they have recruited two forwards in between those expulsions. Of course they want rid.",
      "United have signed one-season wonder strikers (Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani, Cristiano Ronaldo) with a short shelf life while Hojlund was too young. Romelu Lukaku ticked most of the boxes yet he continued to be a peripatetic striker. Radamel Falcao and Anthony Martial were two gambles from Monte Carlo that bust.",
      "And United also have form for settling any Tom, Dick, Harry or Wout. For all the mitigation surrounding the loan arrival of Weghorst in January 2023, opting for another Dutchman who grew up in the same district as the manager was beneath them. Weghorst was playing on loan in Turkey, having riled teammates and supporters at recently relegated Burnley. He scored as many goals for United as Burnley - two tap-ins.",
      "The Weghorst deal was reminiscent of Odion Ighalo's deadline day move in January 2020. Ighalo was playing in China, back when the country's Super League was teeming with Premier League cast-offs, and he was represented by a Norwegian agent who was the same nationality as the United manager.",
      "Ighalo and Weghorst were brought in as the support striker to Martial. Banking on Martial three years apart and under two managers is one of innumerable reasons why United are in the state that they are.",
      "As recently as January, United gave consideration to signing Mathys Tel, a peripheral forward who barely scored for Bayern Munich. Yet United have a penchant for taking surplus squad players from Bayern.",
      "On the basis of the Ighalo and Weghorst deals, any striker with a Portuguese connection should instruct their agent to dial 0161. Ominously, Portugal international Joao Felix is still technically a Chelsea player."

      "Manchester United are growing frustrated at the lack of movement in their hopes of signing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After failing with two bids for the 25-year-old, United are facing the real prospect of missing out on one of their top targets this summer. An opening bid worth £55m was rejected by Brentford before an improved offer in excess of £60m fell short.",
      "It had been understood that a package worth £65m would be enough to bring Mbeumo to the club. However, that figure has now been increased with Brentford now demanding £70m. According to The Guardian, United chiefs do not wish to be held to ransom.",
      "It's expected that a key factor in Brentford's change in stance comes on the back of certain transfers around Europe. Matheus Cunha moved to Old Trafford for £62.5million, Mohammed Kudus completed a £55m transfer to Tottenham and Chelsea paid £60m for Joao Pedro.",
      "However, after being guilty over paying too much for players in the past and the current transfer budget not offering the flexibility to spend large amounts, United could be forced to look elsewhere.",
      "Should no agreement between the two clubs be met, alternatives come into play and attention will swiftly turn on to who can come and fill the vacant gap. One player who has been mentioned in the past is Atalanta's Ademola Lookman.",
      "After previously plying his trade as a winger, or inside forward if you like the fancy phases, Lookman has soared to become Africa's best player with his performances in Italy. In his three seasons in Serie A, the 27-year-old has scored 52 goals. In the last two, he has been involved in a sensational 54 goal involvements.",
      "In the 2023/24 season, Lookman bagged 17 goals and assisted a further 10, helping Atalanta win the Europa League. Last season, he produced the exact same goal contribution total, scoring 20 and assisting seven.",
      "His future in Bergamo has been placed into doubt this summer with Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan making him their top priority. However, he is yet to be involved in a transfer and remains available.",
      "At Atalanta, under Gian Piero Gasperini, Lookman was mainly used as one of the two attackers behind a centre-forward. He usually partnered Charles De Keterlaere or Lazar Samardzic behind Mateo Retegui. Behind Lookman and Retegui, the pair scored a combined 48 goals.",
      "It's a similar system to the one being implemented by Amorim at United. Mbeumo was expected to join Cunha in the two attacking midfielder slots behind the striker. Fortunately, Lookman is more than capable of filling in that spot.",
      "Corriere dello Sport in Italy have reported that Lookman's price tag has been set at €50m (£43.2m) with Inter Milan making him their top target. The newspaper has added that there is optimism that a deal could be struck for around €35m (£30.2m)."

After their opening bid, understood to be worth £55million, was rejected, they tabled a second offer in excess of £60m three weeks later.",
      "United had planned to sign Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season training last week. Instead, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon were the only new recruits who were introduced to their new teammates.",
      "With the opening game of United's pre-season tour of the United States now just over a week away, time is running out for them to sign Mbeumo in time for him to make the plane alongside the rest of the squad.",
      "No shortage of United supporters are frustrated by the ongoing delay, but the Reds, who face Leeds United in their opening friendly this weekend, are refusing to pay over the odds.",
      "Despite the ongoing delay, Mbeumo's hunger to move to Old Trafford is considered as a positive. There is a general feeling the deal will get finalised eventually. But how long is a piece of string?",
      "Amid the ongoing delay, those who could find themselves competing with Mbeumo for a place in Ruben Amorim's starting XI could be secretly pleased. The longer the deal takes to get done, the longer those who could soon be in competition with him will have to impress Amorim in pre-season.",
      "Mbeumo has made a name for himself as a goalscoring winger at Brentford, frequently cutting in from the right flank and using his trustworthy left foot. However, there is no room for natural wingers in Amorim's system, of course.",
      "Mbeumo could be used as the right-sided No.10 or as the right wing-back in the Portuguese chief's 3-4-2-1 system. Some believe he should be unleashed in the attack, while others are in favour of him occupying a place out wide.",
      "Whatever Amorim's plan is, he knows Mbeumo will have competition in the hunt for a starting berth. If he considers the 25-year-old as a wing-back, for example, he will face competition from Diogo Dalot and Amad.",
      "If he views him as one of the two No.10s, he will be challenged by Mason Mount and Amad. The latter is equally comfortable as the right-sided No.10 or as the right-sided wing-back, meaning he and Mbeumo would be able to provide similar characteristics.",
      "If Amorim intends on playing Mbeumo as an attacker, the longer it takes United to make a breakthrough in discussions with Brentford, the stronger Mount's and Amad's chances of nailing down a place in the starting XI will become.",
      "Amad was United's most improved player by a country mile last season and will be a regular starter in 2025/26 whether it be in attack or out wide. If Mbeumo is unleashed on the flank, Amad should start as the No.10 and vice versa.",
      "Mount, though, is a very valuable asset in Amorim's eyes. The United boss has made no secret of just how much he adores him, and there is a very good chance he could become a key player in his third season at Old Trafford if he can stay injury-free.",
      "Despite being signed by United to operate as a No.8 two years ago, Mount is much better when playing further forward in Amorim's system. He is well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation and has the intelligence to offer United what Amorim is looking for.",
      "Unlike Amad, he is not capable of playing out wide, meaning the right-sided No.10 spot, considering new recruit Matheus Cunha is poised to occupy the left-sided playmaker role, is Mount's route into the starting XI.",
      "But with Dalot still considered a valuable player by Amorim, too, he will be hoping to nail down the right wing-back spot this pre-season, meaning Amad and Mount could find themselves in direct competition to start in attack.",
      "Amorim will rotate and tinker throughout pre-season. It may not be until United's final friendly against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9, by which time Mbeumo's signature might have been secured, that his first-choice starting XI for the season opener against Arsenal may be tested.",
      "United need to get Mbeumo through the door sooner rather than later to ease frustrations, but Amad and Mount might be only too happy to wait a little while longer.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "However, after less than 12 months at Molineux, Andre could be on the move again. Corriere dello Sport have reported that United, Liverpool and Juventus are interested in the 5'9\" midfielder. It's added that Andre could be available for as little as £30m.",
      "Andre impressed in his debut season at Wolves, forming a solid midfield partnership with compatriot Joao Gomes. He completed 93 per cent of his passes in the Premier League last term, winning 59 per cent of his duels with an average of six recoveries and three tackles per match. Although Andre doesn't have much aerial presence, he makes up for that with his work rate and high-octane running.",
      "His playing style would fit perfectly at United and would surely be the ideal teammate for Matheus Cunha, who signed for the Reds in a £62.5m move at the start of last month. Andre and Cunha played together at Wolves last season and are both involved with the Brazil national team.",
      "The duo have formed quite a close relationship since Andre decided to move to Wolves and that helped them put in a number of impressive performances on the pitch. Cunha was Wolves' standout performer last term with 17 goals and six assists in 36 appearances, but Andre wasn't far behind.",
      "It felt as though Andre's impact and presence in the middle of midfield helped open up space for Cunha to create opportunities and work up some magic in the final third.",
      "While Cunha might hit the ground running no matter who he has behind him, it has been proven that he can perform alongside Andre and therefore they could be the ideal fit together for United.",
      "Former Wolves star Dave Edwards heaped praise on Andre back in March and described him as one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League. He said: \"I could talk about Andre all day.",
      "\"Very rarely do you see so much passion for defensive actions. He celebrates it like a goal, because, in reality, it’s as big as a goal, because he's stopping an attack, a moment for the opposition.",
      "\"It's great to see it means so much to do that side of the game because everybody wants to be the goal scorer, everybody wants to be the person creating and doing the tricks, but to take so much pride in that defensive work is magnificent, and every team needs players who do that.",
      "\"You can't just have a team of tricksters and flare players. You have to have an Andre in the team who is such an important cog in the wheel. He wins the ball back so many times.",
      "\"A lot of the time it's after we've had an attack, it breaks down, and then he's there to pick up the pieces and we start another attack. That just keeps the opposition under pressure and that's so important.\"",
      "Edwards added: \"He is one of the best number sixes in the league, there's no doubt about that. He really is at the top end of ballplaying central midfielders who start attacks. I've been delighted to see how much he's improved since he's come in, how effective he's now becoming for Wolves, and now how important he is.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to seeing many more games of Andre dictating the play for Wolves.\""

      "Arsenal looked to have moved to the front of the queue last month and made Sesko their first-choice No.9 target. However, the Gunners have since accelerated a move for Viktor Gyokeres instead, with the Sporting CP man closing in on a £63.8million switch to north London, having agreed a five-year contract.",
      "That has left the door open for others, including United, to swoop in and pursue Sesko. According to a report from TBR Football on Wednesday afternoon, intermediaries have offered United, Chelsea and Liverpool the chance to sign the former Red Bull Salzburg man in a deal worth around £60m.",
      "But Sesko has now dropped the biggest hint yet that he could remain at Leipzig for the coming campaign and beyond. In an Instagram story, Sesko posted two images of him wearing Leipzig's brand new 2025/26 kit and posing with the No.30 shirt on the back. He captioned the post: \"Getting some [flashing camera emoji] for new season.\"",
      "As he features in Leipzig's new kit launch and is more than open to promoting that on his personal social media, it's a big suggestion that he is going to remain at the Red Bull club this summer.",
      "Sesko's Leipzig future was the subject of much debate this time in 2024, but he ended that after signing a new five-year contract. Since, he has continued to excel in the Bundesliga and establish himself as one of the best strikers in Europe. He found the net against Bayern Munich twice last season.",
      "Speaking about his future back in May, Sesko said: \"The club has given me a lot and continues to give me a lot every day. It's a great club to develop at. I'm currently a player for RB Leipzig, so I'm taking it day by day. If a transfer happens, and if it doesn’t, then it doesn't.\""

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in management was replete with not just one more Premier League title but one more banning of a journalist.",
      "It was actually two journalists. Mark Ogden and Paul Hetherington were deemed personas non grata for having the temerity to report that Rio Ferdinand would miss Manchester United's first game of the season at Everton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis forced Ferguson to relocate Michael Carrick to centre back alongside Nemanja Vidic on his first appearance in eight months. United lost to a Marouane Fellaini header from a corner at Goodison Park.",
      "It was peculiar that Ferguson, in his seventies and into his 27th year managing United, operated as though journalists were on the club payroll. As recently as December, there was dismay among some of the United online fanbase that this correspondent had obtained the starting XI for the Manchester derby at the Etihad the day before kick-off.",
      "On that occasion, the United manager and staff were nonplussed as team news leaks have gone on for years at the club. Jose Mourinho marvelled at journalists' sourcing but was appalled that someone privy to such information was loose-lipped.",
      "David Moyes vainly attempted to counter team news leaks when he correctly identified the leaker - a senior member of the first team squad. Louis van Gaal's goalkeeping coach, Frans Hoek, followed specific journalists on Twitter after they reported on acrimony in the squad. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag were blasé about early team news entering the public domain.",
      "The appetite for team news has become more insatiable amid the growing popularity of fantasy football. Participants want to be certain of who's in and who's out before the Saturday 11am deadline to pick their teams.",
      "Ruben Amorim has named an unchanged team only once as United coach, away at Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals after the goalless draw with Manchester City at Old Trafford. Rotation was rife as United progressed in that tournament and their league form was sacrificed.",
      "Innumerable injuries meant Ten Hag selected his clear and obvious starting XI only once, at Wolves in February 2024. United were so impressive in the first hour of the exhausting 4-3 win that Ten Hag was visibly unhappy they had not won by a wider margin.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot are two of the most durable players in Europe, never mind England. Noussair Mazraoui, likely to be reduced to squad-player status next term, started in 34 Premier League matches in his first season in the competition.",
      "Injury will prevent Andre Onana from appearing during United's pre-season tour of the United States but he has not missed a league match through injury. United's five specialist centre backs all admittedly endured lengthy injury lay-offs in 2024-25.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is still not a United player but lined up in all 38 of Brentford's matches last term. Brentford played 43 games overall. United are a new striker and Mbeumo short of an obvious first XI.",
      "The United fitness staff has been freshened up. Richard Hawkins has left after 17 years mainly overseeing the team's physical performance and Paolo Gaudino has gone after 14 years as fitness coach. Amorim's compatriot, Paulo Barreira, is leading the club's sports science. Alistair McBurnie and Michael Eglon, relatively recent additions to the sports science department, both remain.",
      "With a lighter workload and greater recovery time between games, United's injury toll should be lower than previous campaigns. That said, the last time they had a year devoid of European football they had such regular injury issues that Van Gaal made light of the fact they had \"only one player injured\" on the eve of the visit of Southampton in January 2015.",
      "There are eerie parallels 11 years on: a United manager's first full season, the team operating in a back three and without a UEFA competition to fill the calendar. Ed Woodward confidently briefed that the injury-prone trio Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans would have their \"most available seasons\" in 2014-15. All three were sidelined six games into the campaign and Paddy McNair had to come into the fold.",
      "A United manager seldom picks the same players in successive weeks. The outlier was when the Premier League season restarted amid the Covid-19 pandemic in June 2020. Solskjaer maximised the three-month suspension by settling on a winning formula that was unchanged in five consecutive league games.",
      "That had not happened since February 1993. Back then, United were galvanised by Eric Cantona and fixated on ending their 26-year title drought. Their European campaign ended in September and they exited the FA Cup at Sheffield United in the midst of the league run.",
      "The closest Ferguson ever got to a sequence of unchanged sides again was in October and November 2006 when he entrusted the same XI in three consecutive league fixtures. The common denominator is the 1992-93 and 2006-07 titles were his greatest domestic triumphs.",
      "Solskjaer's strategy eventually backfired. He would gain a reputation for running players into the ground and, after the 2-2 draw with Southampton, was without a recognisable left back as Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams became two flies to drop. Right back Timothy Fosu-Mensah returned like Lazarus for his first United appearance in more than three years at Crystal Palace.",
      "In Van Gaal's first season, he did not opt for the same XI until Tottenham Hotspur away on December 28 2014, two days after the Boxing Day stroll against Newcastle United. It made little sense with that unforgivingly tight turnaround and Van Gaal admitted after the goalless draw the second half was \"a struggle for life\".",
      "He happened upon a winning formula three months later. With Shaw injured again and the meek Angel di Maria suspended, Van Gaal moved Daley Blind to left back, recalled Jones and Juan Mata and United blitzed Spurs 3-0 in the first half of the reverse fixture. In their next game, United produced what remains their best performance at Anfield in the past 30 years to win 2-1.",
      "Bar an enforced change for the resumption of the season at home to Aston Villa, Van Gaal kept the same side for four games running. The sequence only ended with Vincent Kompany's malicious tackle on Blind and a season-ending calf injury to the pivotal Carrick in the 4-2 defeat of City.",
      "After much trial-and-error with other systems, Van Gaal had switched to a 4-3-3 formation. That was reported by the MEN before it was introduced.",
      "Nobody was banned."

But I think that's what he needed from Preston, then go to La Liga, then the next step Portugal, every time stepping up to a higher club and a better league, so we have to see and assess the situation if he can maybe be an option for us in the future.",

      "Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo has become the saga of this summer transfer window.",
      "Brentford turned down two bids for the Cameroon international during June, the most recent being worth up to £62.5million, which matches what they paid Wolverhampton Wanderers for Matheus Cunha. A release clause in the latter's contract made that a more straightforward negotiation, only necessitating the clubs agree on a structure for that payment.",
      "The Bees could have benefitted from a similar clause in the contract of a player they are said to see as a possible replacement for Mbeumo. However, it now appears as though that ship has sailed.",
      "Omari Hutchinson reportedly had a relegation release clause in his contract with Ipswich Town worth £35million. His former club, Chelsea, exercised a £30million one earlier this summer to sign Liam Delap, who United also wanted.",
      "However, the clause is said to have expired at 5pm on Tuesday, July 15. The Athletic reports Brentford approached Ipswich for Hutchinson on Monday, but the bid fell short of the £35m figure and was rejected.",
      "It is said the Bees see the attacking midfielder as among a limited number of possible replacements for Mbeumo. The East Anglian Daily Times reports that Ipswich could even now increase their price for Hutchinson, which would deal a blow to Brentford's hopes of signing him.",
      "Ipswich paid Chelsea a club-record fee of around £20million to sign Hutchinson barely 12 months ago. Therefore, they would presumably want to register a healthy profit from that investment.",
      "United, meanwhile, may well have been watching in the hope Brentford's move for Hutchinson was successful in order to pave the way for Mbeumo's transfer to Old Trafford to be given the green light. As the wait for any news on Mbeumo's move to United continues, it feels as thought the transfer domino effect of Brentford missing out on Hutchinson, for now at least, could be key in ensuring it goes on a little longer."

      "The Reds have been working on a transfer to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford, but that has proven to be difficult. Brentford don't want to lose the 25-year-old and are playing hardball. In fact, Keith Andrews' side believe Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season, is worth around £63m.",
      "Elsewhere, United want to get players out of the door. Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have informed the club of their desire to explore different opportunities this summer.",
      "Manchester United have made a last-minute attempt to secure Hugo Ekitike from under Newcastle United's nose, according to TEAMTalk. It's claimed that Ruben Amorim's side have made a 'serious 11th-hour bid' to hijack Newcastle's move for Ekitike. The Reds have made contact with Ekitike and his representatives.",
      "INEOS is involved in speeding up the transfer and United are considering a player-plus-cash offer. Ekitike enjoyed a fine season at Eintracht Frankfurt, scoring 22 goals and provided 12 assists in 48 appearances.",
      "MEN says: Ekitike should be United's first-choice striker target this summer. While I think he will move to a Champions League club, the Reds should push hard to try and convince him to move to Old Trafford.",
      "The 22-year-old has got everything a modern centre forward needs. He is quick, strong, can run in behind but also has a unique dribbling ability for a 6\"3 man, similar to that of Alexander Isak.",
      "AC Milan are working behind-the-scenes to get a deal done for Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund, according to Italian media outlet SportMediaset. Ruben Amorim's side are closing in on a deal for Mbeumo and that could open up the departure for one of their strikers, including the Denmark international.",
      "With Santiago Gimenez starting pre-season as Milan's only senior recognised front-man, they need at least another centre forward and Hojlund is right at the top of their shopping list.",
      "MEN says: To enable a move for Ekitike, one of Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee has got to go. Because Zirkzee has the ability to play in the two No.10 roles and improved as last season wore on, I think Hojlund has to be the man that is sold. Having had previous experience in Serie A at Atalanta, Milan wouldn't be a bad club for him. He has the potential and ability to be their main man next season ahead of Gimenez, that's for sure."

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Liverpool\nCome again? While speculating over the Reds’ alternatives to Isak, the Daily Mail writes: “Rashford was also floated but that initial conversation has not progressed so far.” Of course it hasn’t. Though Rashford winning 21 at Anfield next season would be very modern-day Manchester United.",
      "",
      "",
      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. So what now for the ex-England international?",
      "",
      "17) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern have made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool won’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, but £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, but it feels very unlikely the two clubs will compromise while they stand £30million apart in their current valuations.

The one signing they made in January was a left wing-back, though Patrick Dorgu showed almost nothing in his half-season so far.",
      "",

Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",

Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s gotta go somewhere…",
      "",
      "12) Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to West Ham\nThe Hammers seem keen to put some of their Kudus cash into luring Elliott away from Liverpool but it is so far unclear what the Reds would accept. The Guardian says ‘preparations for a move are being conducted’ which have to start with a simple question: how much?",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nIt seemed as though United were at fault for this dragging as long as it has but now we hear of Brentford increasing their demand to £70million. Perhaps as a consequence of their own frustration at United’s lack of decisiveness. The Red Devils appear determined not to go over £65million, but Brentford’s show of strength could prompt them to get to their maximum a little faster.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool were rebuffed in their initial enquiry but we doubt they took ‘no’ as a final answer. We can still imagine a deal happening if the Reds say they will step back from Ekitike – and if Isak agitates for the move.",
      "",
      "7) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Newcastle\nSome reports at the start of the week suggested Ekitike’s agents were in Newcastle, others say a Toon delegation was in Germany. Whatever. Talks were certainly taking place, which apparently involved Eintracht saying ‘nein’ to Newcastle’s opening bid of £70million. It has always been reported that the Germans want more for the forward, perhaps as much as £85million. And they will feel emboldened by the bidding battle that could ensue since Liverpool are determined to ‘go to war’, according to The Telegraph.",
      "",
      "6) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nLiverpool heard the rejection of their advances on Alexander Isak and reacted with violence by targeting the stiker Newcastle crave. We make Liverpool favourites here on the basis they have greater spending power. We assume so since they were willing to make a record bid for Isak. And also because Liverpool are the more attractive option right now. That’s not to denigrate Newcastle – it’s an exciting time up there too – but Liverpool have strengthened significantly as champions. Of course everyone else is playing catch up.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "Man Utd have been trying hard in recent weeks to convince Brentford to accept their valuation of Mbeumo with the Bees refusing two offers for the Cameroon international.",
      "Football Insider‘s senior correspondent Pete O’Rourke gave an update on the situation at the end of last week, he said: “I don’t think there’s any real panic from Manchester United over the pursuit of Brian Mbeumo – the key here is that the player wants the move.",
      "“Brentford have obviously rejected two offers so far of around £60million – they’re going to try and get as much as they possibly can.",
      "“I still expect a deal for Mbeumo to go through, probably meet somewhere in the middle around £62–63million pounds.",

      "While transfer expert Fabrizio Romano also struck a similar tone to O’Rourke, he said: “The contacts are still ongoing between United, Brentford, people involved in the deal. Mbeumo still wants to go to Manchester United, and the club maintains their confidence, their optimism, to get the green light and sign Bryan Mbeumo in the next days.",

They are working on easy and difficult add-ons, trying to make Brentford happy with their final proposal. So Man United are still on it. The Bryan Mbeumo deal is absolutely alive at this moment.”",

      "After it was known that Mbeumo wanted to join Man Utd, Brentford ‘privately indicated a medical was expected imminently’ but now both Ratcliffe and technical director Jason Wilcox ‘do not wish to be held to ransom and are determined to be patient’.",
      "A deal is ‘still not imminent’ for Bryan Mbeumo as Man Utd and Brentford continue to negotiate a fee for the forward, according to David Ornstein.",
      "Man Utd have made ‘initial contact’ with a Lyon star as the Red Devils are dealt a blow by Brentford in their bid to sign Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd have been dealt a blow in their bid to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer as one Bees sale ‘would almost certainly rule out’ another.",
      "Brentford are lining up Ipswich Town forward Omari Hutchinson as a potential replacement for Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘agreed terms’ for their next summer signing, while one star has been ‘granted approval’ to leave the club.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing."

      "18) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",

      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",

      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",

The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",

      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time.

      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",

      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level.

But I presume they are not included in the Big Six as there are two of them.",

Big film TV premieres, Disney Time, Morecambe and Wise, Top of the Pops with the Christmas number one. For a few years, we also got to see The Harlem Globetrotters travelling basketball / entertainment team. They always played brilliant, entertaining basketball with wonderful trick shots, dribbling, ball juggling and comedy routines thrown in. Their opponents were routinely made to look foolish, and, in my naivety, I often wondered what was in it for them, why did they keep turning up and suffering the humiliation Meadowlark Lemon, Curly et al would inflict on them.",
      "Of course that’s what they were there for, paid stooges to make the Globetrotters look good, like Ernie Wise was mainly there to highlight Eric Morecambe’s comedy genius. It turns out they were another touring team called the Washington Generals set up purely for that purpose. It wasn’t intended to be genuine sport, it was pretend eye-candy for TV viewers around the world.",
      "So what’s this got to do with football? Well, as a Villa fan, my team has progressed far enough to become one of those knocking against the glass ceiling of the ever more entrenched “wealthy elite”. Those in the elite were fortunate enough to have either been successful when the PL rose to prominence and gained a global audience via Sky TV rights and the internet, or they were able to buy their way unrestricted into the club via incredibly wealthy owners.",
      "By the time Villa, Newcastle, Forest and a few other clubs acquired owners who were willing to invest heavily in their clubs, the football authorities made sure the ceiling was not only firmly in place but was made of PSR/FFP/115 reinforced bullet-proof glass. And the football authorities’ clear intent is to disarm outsiders of any tools capable of breaking it and killing or wounding their golden goose.",
      "Thus it has effectively created a mini-super league within the PL (notwithstanding the astounding capacity of United and to a lesser extent Spurs to monumentally screw things up despite every advantage) and, to my mind, this is intentional, driven by fear that the wealthier clubs will be tempted to join an actual super league by the likes of Real and Juventus if their positions aren’t protected within the PL and CL.",
      "As a consequence it increasingly feels like Villa, and other ambitious teams in similar and lesser positions, are simply there to make up the numbers. Two thirds of the PL just a bunch of Washington Generals and Ernie Wises, stooges only there to provide pseudo competition for the wealthy elite, to make them look good.",
      "Surely it is only a matter of time before Chelsea, Citeh and their European counterparts start working comedy routines, trick shots and ritual humiliations into their performances for the delight of plastics, glory hunters (yes I mean you Paco – why Chelsea Paco, and not Fulham or Brentford?) and casual TV viewers across the globe, safe in the knowledge that they will still win because the other guys are only there to lose to them.",
      "The Club World Cup is just the latest inevitable symptom and manifestation of this travelling circus approach. There’s money in it for FIFA, and there’s money in it for those who already have more than anyone else, and there is gratification for some of the global glory hunters who will be queuing up for more.",
      "The issue I have is that PL clubs have the power to change things but they don’t seem to want to. I can only imagine that some smaller PL clubs without mega wealthy owners don’t vote to amend or abolish FFP rules because they fear that the elite group would only get bigger and they still wouldn’t be in it . Or they fear it will “damage the product” if certain teams aren’t successful all the time. If that’s the case they deserve nothing more than regular humiliation at the hands of the big boys.",

If Eintracht is compliant about payment structure, this could be a real coup, and I hope it goes through.",
      "Isak and Ekitike playing together could be madness in its own right, but the option of reverting to a front three when one is injured or misfiring is gold, as far as Eddie is concerned. Low blocks have flummoxed the Mags since he arrived, and he hasn’t previously had a Plan B. Elanga and Gordon will pin fullbacks wide if we play a 442, I could see Tonali and Bruno scoring a lot more goals in that system.",

I suspect, however, that either Barnes or Gordon would leave by January. Joe Willock to Manchester United has never been mooted, but it would be a decent move for them, West Ham, or any of the promoted sides.

Sure, as a paid up member of Team Sesko, its a bit disappointing and I have some worries, but like 99.9% of normal fans, it isn’t hard to move past that and support Big Vic.",
      "There’s a lot riding on this season for sure, so nervous anticipation might be the best mood descriptor, but after last season, which felt like a series of cartoon anvils and grand pianos falling on our heads, I don’t think it’s too presumptuous to say we’re quite looking forward to going into a new campaign with real squad depth, a proper preseason and hopefully no immediate injuries.\nTom, Leyton",

      "On the CWC, the biggest issue beyond overplaying players and the dreadful spectacle around the games is that the amount of money involved is going to massively skew domestic leagues across the world. Auckland FC made USD3.5m for being in the tournament – that’s 4 years of turnover. How can other clubs in their league compete? It’s like when the Champions League expanded and clubs from smaller nations that happened to be in the first iteration got enough money to dominate their leagues for a decade. More money to fewer clubs means less competition – all Infantino seems to want is to have the best teams play each other all the time to make as much money as possible, which reduces the excitement and ultimately overall quality of the sport.\nTom, Andover",

      "We upgraded 9 of our starting 11, and bought 16 players in total.",
      "TLDR: We lost our style of play, culture, and resilience, and were still trying to find our best team in April.",
      "Bedding down new players is not easy, from Real Madrid downwards.",
      "The guys that secured 100 points and promotion basically have to be trusted, even if it is clear that they’re not good enough – some of our best results (not many, I know) had a core of 6-7 players who played for Ipswich in Div 1. The rest were strangers until it was far too late…",
      "That, of course, is the Sword of Damocles attached to promotion – damned if you do, damned if you don’t.",
      "Hopefully see you next year – enjoy Liam Delap…\nMatthew (ITFC – a shedload of cash and who knows)",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer exposes Sir Gareth\nAfter another MoM (or Superior Player according to the Yanks) performance from Palmer, we can see Sir Gareth only played him for 144 minutes out of a possible 690 (plus injury time I can’t be arsed to count) in Euro 2024. Compare that to",
      "Bellingham (why always me indeed) 671 mins\nFoden 622 mins",
      "Experimenting with Trent in midfield also. We may have world-class players in England, but we’re certainly not using them. Hopefully Tuchel will do better, after he’s finished with his Henderson experiment.",

      "",
      "…Cole Palmer has played in 4 senior finals (European Championship, European super cup, Europa conference and Club World Cup) with 4 goals and 3 assists. 1.75 goal involvements per game and scoring or assisting 78% of his teams’ goals in those 4 finals.",
      "Leaving him out of the Conference League squad in the first half of the season was superb decision making as was recalibrating the team to be less reliant on him during the season.",
      "Chelsea need to go cojones out next season in terms of trusting their whole squad (including George and Acheampong). The top players should only be playing 2 games in 3 and squad players should be starting 1 in 3.",

      "",
      "A final word on the Club World Cup\nI think the main thing that folks like me have against eminently political things like the revamped Club World Cup, is the encouraging of political discourse in football, and mails like the intellectual drivel contained in Paco’s note from Accra.",
      "In it s simplest form, you have the claim from football fans the world over, when something they want is acquired by an arse, or a nation state, or gets a sponsor from a pollutant or war criminal, that ‘what are they supposed to do; I was a fan first, my story with this is longer than theirs’. And it’s hard to argue against. I know how I’d hope to react if it was my team, but I don’t know what I’d do for sure.",
      "I do know I didn’t watch a second of the Qatar World Cup, and ideally would have liked every match report to have started with the sentence “As the families of the deceased workers are still trying to get the wages due, and the bodies remain shamefully missing, we watched a great game of football today as…”. But, it’s the World Cup. Football has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. It brings people together and is a cauldron for joy, for the most part. So if folks wanted to watch Qatar, they should.",
      "But those arguments don’t apply for the revamped version of the CWC; This is a ‘new’ tournament, so an opportunity to hold to your principles, or declare you have none. The CAPSLOCK brigade can rightly and perpetually laugh at Jordan Henderson for demonstrably being dim, but if they watched the CWC then I can’t see how they can have a go at him for his ethical stances or lack there-of.",
      "It was funded by the Saudi regime, proposed by Infantino and for the personal glory of Infantino, hosted by Trump under the spectre of ICE, and played upon condemnation from player-unions and managers like Ancelloti amongst many, many others. You had the very easy option of just electing not to watch, but if you did it was transparent what you were supporting, who was paying for it, and who benefited from it.",
      "As for Paco’s arguments about its reception globally, his raving review doesn’t tally with there being literally zero bidders to broadcast it, so it had to be propped up by the ghouls behind DAZN, and ticket sales were considerably lower than when the same teams visit the same venues for pre-season friendlies.",
      "We have to be mindful of our own echo chambers and just because mine thinks one thing it doesn’t mean everyone’s does, but it shouldn’t also tally that just because Paco had a whale of time watching this it doesn’t mean broadcasting and attendance numbers haven’t been abysmal for this thing that they literally had to give away free-to-air because no one would pay for it.",
      "And it expressly being a vehicle to increase the wealth of European football clubs does somewhat chime against your ludicrous point that this tournament offering three games to Boca so Real Madrid, Chelsea or PSG can win a billion is for the benefit of the ‘global game’.",
      "Finally, my not watching this has sod all to do with bigotry or the colonial past of Britain, which you mis-spelled as England. I’m well aware of what was done, and the reason I’m aware of it is because there is considerable effort to try and educate on it, via school, subsidised documentaries and case histories from the BBC, and eminently successful historians, of every race and nation, whom are either British themselves or found a home and commercial success in Britain in trying to educate us on the abominations of the past and present, and those voices are amplified in the mainstream print media rather than quashed.",
      "There is no comparison as to what nation is ‘worst’ without a tedious race to the bottom and attempts to trivialise what should never be trivialised. But politely, what is now Ghana does not have a history of rainbows and unicorns. I say this not to say ‘you’re just as bad’ but to say that every nation, hidden it’s dark recesses, has been an arsehole. The more pertinent question is what is your country doing to try and move things forward, and of that, I am at least grateful that Britain does more than post colonial France, and Belgium, and Spain, and Portugal. This is not a source of pride in any way shape or form.",
      "In fact for the most part, I see the country led by morons trying desperately to undo the very small positive steps taken. But the things you know happened account for 13% of our 3000 year history. It’s enough to damn our reputation but doesn’t damn who we are trying to be. We are, after all, the land that has a red cross as a flag because we stole from it from a bigger-boy in the Mediterranean, entirely because we were so repeatedly raided and enslaved that we had to steal the valour of someone who could fight back, until we were able to ourselves.",
      "We are the fans that march behind a song written by left wing comedians and scousers, about the improbability of hope and tacit acceptance that we could be successful but likely won’t be. The nation that has three lions on our badge rather than one, like Scotland, as it’s a crest of compromise. Just because we have taken against something, and are (in my case) white, doesn’t mean the opinion is invalid or due to bigotry.",
      "And frankly, when a site for chatting about the nonsense of football becomes an exercise of thought pieces on colonialism you have to acknowledge that the beautiful game is being stolen by arseholes with political ends. That the fact we are talking about this should emphasise this is not what football should be about.\nTom G",
      "",
      "Loving the Lionesses\nLike Matt (Gooner exiled in Essex) I watched the England Wales women’s Euro game rather than the Chelsea PSG men’s Club World Cup final. Largely because I had absolutely no interest in the two teams playing in the Club World Cup final.",
      "I don’t support any of the teams that played in the Club World Cup but I support England at that means supporting any England team be it the men’s senior England team, the U21 men’s England team and the senior women’s England team. I too found it refreshing and in general I find watching the women’s England team refreshing and more enjoyable than watching the men’s England team. This is because with the women’s team there isn’t the toxicity that surrounds the men’s team.",
      "No abuse directed at the players if they underperform, no racism aimed at the black players from knuckle dragging “fans” and no vitriol from the English media. Also the female England players private lives aren’t subjected to anything like the same level of scrutiny as their male counterparts so we don’t get who their dating as a media distraction. And in general there isn’t the same media circus that you get with the men’s team come every major tournament where everything including what the players had for breakfast is poured over and debated. It’s all so refreshing, more enjoyable and is about the football rather than anything else.\nDan, London"

      "A common refrain – from us as much as anyone else – was that Ruben Amorim was a fool to take over United mid-season when he could and should have waited to take charge in the off-season and be able to properly build and prepare his squad.",
      "We are now coming to realise that in fact it makes no odds when or under what circumstances you take over at English football’s largest basket case.",
      "Precious little of the very obviously necessary squad-building has taken place as we reach mid-July with the start of the season only a month away. Matheus Cunha came in right at the start of the summer, and that is an exciting signing. But Cunha is a mercurial maverick and other assorted cliches. He could definitely thrive at United, but he could also lose the plot entirely under the harsh spotlight that comes with the territory here.",
      "And since then, with United still scraping together coppers from down the back of Sir Jim’s sofa and none of the decks cleared of the various highly-paid members of the unwanted bomb squad, their transfer window is at an impasse.",
      "United face the very real prospect now of starting the new season riddled with every bit as much chaos and uncertainty as they ended the last. Which is a lot of chaos and far too much uncertainty.",
      "With no European distraction they surely won’t be quite as catastrophically bad in the league as they were in 24/25, but the very fact we live on a timeline where that is the kind of glass-half-full, every-cloud sentence you can right about This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About is painfully revealing in itself.",

      "17) Brentford (16)\nMost summers see an overachieving Premier League club stripped to the bone by the Big Six vultures, but this summer appears to be a particularly brutal summer for several such clubs with Brentford looking like being the hardest hit.",
      "Losing Thomas Frank is an enormous blow. We simply don’t know just how vital he was to Brentford’s success at establishing themselves in the top flight because he’s just always been there quietly doing an excellent job in surroundings where he felt enormously comfortable.",
      "We’re about to find out both whether he can flourish at an objectively sillier club, but also whether the estimable Brentford project can work without him.",
      "We’d suggest that would be an easier task had they not also lost Christian Norgaard to Arsenal, with Bryan Mbeumo soon and then very possibly Yoane Wissa and very possibly more besides also following Frank out of the exit door.",
      "It’s a summer of such alarming churn and uncertainty that even the one stab at stability and familiarity – promoting from within by giving Keith Andrews his first managerial role – looks forced.",
      "The desire for some kind of continuity was understandable, but with Frank taking so many of his coaching staff with him to Tottenham we do wonder whether Brentford have got this right and it’s very easy to get The Fear about how their season might pan out.",
      "Handing the reins to a set-piece coach who has never managed at first-team level just feels like a gamble of startling proportions in the circumstances. It’s the sort of person you hand the interim role when you are left with no choice midway through the season, which begs the question who exactly Brentford will hand the interim role when they are left with no choice midway through the season.",

      "16) Arsenal (17)\nThe wait for a striker nears its end, but the mood around Arsenal remains febrile. As ever, the challenge with Arsenal is not to be swayed too far in either direction by the gobshitery of their loudest and most ridiculous supporters, but there’s a clear sense of unease.",
      "The #NoToMadueke behaviour was not that of a well football club at peace with itself. For all the absence of self-awareness that so frequently defines the most terminally and noisily online of the club’s fans, Arsenal know, don’t they? They very clearly know that they can’t have another year of moral victories or winning on xG or watching other clubs gleefully celebrate winning assorted pots and pans while they sit gloomily in the corner explaining why that trophy they themselves never won is beneath their attention, actually.",
      "This has to be the season where all the undoubted progress and growth and development of the last three years arrives at something tangible. And that’s obviously going to be very difficult.",
      "One of our very earliest predictions for next season was that Arsenal would win the league if they got the striker situation sorted, and we are going to stubbornly stick to that. We don’t know whether Arsenal actually do have it in them to deliver that title after all this time, but we are very confident that somewhere along the way they will be top of the mood rankings and somewhere along the way they will be bottom. And that’s the real quiz, isn’t it? Well, no.",
      "The problem for Arsenal’s threepeat runners-up is that a glance around suggests a league that is only getting harder to win, not easier. From having only City to worry about – and that was enough, frankly – Arsenal now very obviously have Liverpool to think about and on current evidence very possibly Chelsea as well. And these are all clubs for whom winning trophies remains a far more straightforward habit to maintain than it is for the Gunners.",
      "",
      "15) Bournemouth (12)\nIt’s the nature of life for the Premier League’s overachievers and strivers, but Bournemouth already appear to be among the worst hit this year and there’s still time for it to get worse.",
      "Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez were exceptional members of a high-class back four for Bournemouth last year, and while the hundred million-odd quid the Cherries have banked for the pair is welcome it’s still a desperately hard task to fill two gaps of that size in one summer. Even for a club that’s pretty good at rolling with these punches. And there’s still lingering talk of Illia Zabarnyi heading to Paris as well, talk that their humbling at the hands of Chelsea is unlikely to silence.",
      "But they’ve kept their manager which didn’t feel certain at the start of the summer, and Antoine Semenyo’s new contract amid interest from plenty of big fish is another significant boon. Feels like a big finish to the transfer window might well be needed, though.",
      "",
      "14) Burnley (15)\nDespite finishing miles ahead of eventual play-off winners Sunderland and right alongside Leeds at the top of last season’s Championship, it does feel slightly like Burnley are the forgotten member of the promoted trio right now.",
      "Leeds are Leeds and Sunderland are doing all sorts of wildly eye-catching transfer business, while Burnley appear to just be going about things more quietly. That might well be entirely prudent, of course, and by September their less flashy antics might well look by far the most sensible of the promoted clubs.",
      "But fundamentally we do not trust Scott Parker to be manager of a Premier League team. We are going to need to see some pretty clear evidence he’s going to be better at it this time around, and until such time as we see that evidence we will have to keep Burnley’s mood down.",
      "That said, they do have the boost that all three promoted teams have this summer: so many seemingly settled established teams being picked to the bone.",
      "",
      "13) Sunderland (14)\nThe loss of Jobe Bellingham is a shame and robs the Premier League of an interesting and unexpected storyline, while offering instead the ‘Will a Bellingham ever actually play in the Premier League?’ quandary, but Sunderland’s summer activity certainly hints at a club that if they are going to go back down are going to do kicking and screaming. No quietly accepting their fate for a club who’ve brought in six players from around Europe.",
      "At the very, very least they should avoid Southampton’s season-long struggle to avoid Derby-based ignominy and that’s a start, isn’t it?",
      "Doesn’t hurt to see a division that suddenly contains a lot more plausible relegation rivals than appeared the case at the time of Sunderland’s shock play-off success.",
      "",
      "12) Wolves (8)\nIt is the time of year when we instinctively and reflexively start to worry about Wolves because they start every season like absolute muck.",
      "And that’s true even in summers where they haven’t sold a couple of their best players as well.",
      "We might have felt a bit different had they carried that winning run they had last spring all the way to the finish line, but once they no longer actually needed any further points they simply stopped getting them in the final four games and while that didn’t matter for 24/25, Wolves are the one team we would particularly worry about carrying that drearier form all the way through the summer with them before depositing it with big trumpy dump in a one-win-in-nine games start to the season.",
      "It is the history of the Wolves.",
      "",
      "11) Nottingham Forest (9)\nInteresting club, are Forest. By the end of last season there was a distinct whiff of entitlement around the place. Sure, you’ve got a couple of European Cups in the trophy cabinet and that’s undeniably something that can inflate the ol’ ego a bit but while the rest of us were going “Cor look at Forest having a brilliant season” there was definitely a sense of some (by no means all) their fans not quite enjoying it as much as they really should have done because to them this was nothing more than the restoring of the club to its rightful status.",
      "That’s fine, but it does also mean that as well as not fully enjoying the good times you can end up getting more miffed than is healthy about the less good, and while the harrumphing at the sale of Anthony Elanga and still-likely departure of Morgan Gibbs-White is understandable, the general air of “How can this thing that happens to all clubs outside the cosseted elite be happening to us, Nottingham Forest?” doesn’t seem like it’s the sort of thing that can end with anyone feeling good about anything really.",
      "There’s something similar about the extent of apparent behind-the-scenes lobbying Forest have done to get themselves Crystal Palace’s place in the Europa League. Sure, it makes sense to want to be in the Europa League, but the Conference felt like a tournament Forest would have a genuine shot at winning in a way that even the current even-Spurs-can-win-it watered-down Europa League doesn’t.",
      "We do also very much enjoy the idea of contracts having secret release clauses the very activation of which constitutes a breach of said secrecy, but not really sure how well that’s going to actually stand up in practice.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester City (19)\nWe’re as excited as you to find out whether City’s embarrassing early exit from the Club World Cup constitutes the latest stage in the decline of the Guardiola Empire or will, come May, have been fully reimagined as the blessing in disguise that allows them to reclaim their Premier League title as Chelsea wilt on the run-in.",
      "The important thing, of course, is that in and of itself not doing much at the Club World Cup doesn’t really matter. Had that happened on the back of a more customary City season in which the Premier League and probably a cheeky domestic cup had been safely trousered nobody would bat an eyelid.",
      "But another failed shot at silverware on the back of the first genuinely worrying season since Guardiola really got going at City means it does catch the eye slightly more.",
      "Feels like City are a side who could do with making a statement start to the season, and the worry for them is that fast starts are not their great strength. Very good starts and then unimprovably relentlessly opposition-spirit-crushing finishes have been the modus operandi for Pep’s teams.",
      "But last year was one to puncture the idea that City will always come decisively good down the home straight, and once that kind of aura is lost its powerfully hard to restore.",
      "What City have done is continue with the rebuild that began in January and it’s certainly going to be exciting to watch a new-look post-De Bruyne City in action. But we’ve not been this uncertain about them before a ball’s been kicked for several years.",
      "Which is all the evidence we need to know they will be 12 points clear by November and win the league by 20 points in the end while spinning effortlessly upon the very tips of their cocks.",
      "",
      "9) Everton (11)\nGenuine question: has anyone seen or heard anything at all to do with or about Everton over the last couple of months? We’re genuinely struggling. They just seem to be there in the background, like the whole club is just on the backburner in this empty space between leaving Goodison and arriving at their new stadium, at which point everyone once again notices them.",
      "That’s fine, but it does leave us with not a huge amount to say here really. They’ll probably be fine, won’t they? Yeah, they’ll probably be fine. New stadium looks nice and that. Always exciting until you realise you’ve accidentally set yourselves back 10 years on the pitch to pay for it, but still always exciting.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa (7)\nThe entirely unrelated and coincidentally timed sale of their women’s team to themselves appears to have kept PSR wolves from doors for now and allows Villa to continue for now looking to a positive future without having to do anything as unpleasant as sell some players like Newcastle did last year, the damn fools.",
      "That said, they’ve not really actually done anything particularly proactive in the transfer market either. Not even a mutually beneficial signing of a toddler from Everton or anything. Very disappointing, and on a vaguely serious note potentially slightly problematic for a team still right on the limit when it comes to the financial rules and who have waved goodbye to a few loan players who really did become quite important during the second half of last season.",
      "These feel like nervous times for Villa, a club that teeters on the divide between two possible futures. Missing out on the Champions League as agonisingly as they did really might turn out to have been far more significant for Villa than it would have been for anyone else in that situation.",
      "",
      "7) Fulham (13)\nFeels like it’s been a very, very quiet summer at Fulham thus far. And a quick look around at the teams sharing Premier League mid-table real estate with the Cottagers last season suggests that quiet and boring might be just the ticket this summer.",
      "Sure, we all like seeing lots of new signings come through the door and at some point it would seem like a very good idea for Fulham to join in with that particular endeavour but for the upwardly-mobile middle-class this appears to be a summer where standing still might not actually be the worst net result.",
      "",
      "6) Brighton (10)\nWe’ve all been here before and we’ve all said it before but is Joao Pedro finally the point at which Chelsea sign a player from Brighton and Brighton don’t instantly by some alchemic magic still manage to get better as a result?",
      "Feels like he’s the first player to tread that well-worn path over recent years who feels both a massive gain for Chelsea and a huge hard-to-replace loss for Brighton.",
      "And that’s a bit of a buzzkill, we fear, for a club who already have a little bit of rueing to do about the way last season ended up with them just outside Europe and paying a heavy price for an on-brand mid-season slump.",
      "There’s nothing hugely bollard-grabbing about the business Brighton have done on the incoming side this summer, but that’s fine because that’s always the way with Brighton. They do transfers that only turn out to have always looked brilliant in hindsight, which is very much the right way to go about these things.",
      "",
      "5) Crystal Palace (2)\nMight eventually be able to channel the current sense of anger and injustice at being booted from the Europa League into another fine season, but for now it is just anger and injustice.",
      "Hard right now to escape the sense that Palace are paying an enormously heavy price for an administrative cock-up while actual multi-club empires are able to circumvent the rules with ease and disdain.",
      "And really how much of a cock-up even was it? Forest were able to take steps to dodge the multi-club bullet before the March deadline because by then it was pretty clear that Europe was a near certainty. Palace had no such certainty.",
      "Nothing can take away from Palace’s joy at finally landing that first piece of major silverware with a famous FA Cup win over Manchester City, but there is a bitter taste now. They’ll just have to go and win the Conference, we guess, while sticking pins in their Evangelos Marinakis dolls.",
      "To which end (the winning the Conference part, not the doll part) they could also really do with not selling all their best players this summer if they can possibly avoid it.",
      "",
      "4) Leeds (5)\nIt’s not so much what Leeds themselves are doing this summer as what’s happening to an awful lot of the teams that they might consider among their potential rivals that creates such cause for optimism.",
      "There is clearly further work needed on the squad before it can be truly said to be one that has a genuine crack at survival, but the potential bottom half of the Premier League in 25/26 looks decidedly weaker now than it did in May.",
      "Leeds also have lovely, lovely kits for their return to the top flight and while some may consider it irrelevant because at the end of the day it is, it can still provide a welcome midsummer boost in those long barren football-less wastelands.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle United (3)\nWe thought all was broadly well on Tyneside, but then the early Sack Race odds that have Eddie Howe nowhere near as safe as we expected have slightly thrown us for a loop.",
      "What are we missing here? Champions League football. No apparent need to or significant risk of selling any of their many very excellent players – most notably of course Alexander Isak.",
      "Is it just the continued inability to just buy their way to absolutely anything and everything? Feels like that shouldn’t be so surprising now.",
      "We can only really see two reasons for any real lack of cheer at Newcastle right now. One, the fact that the four teams who finished above them last season all look like being stronger next year. And two, adidas have made a complete bollocks of their kit for next season.",
      "But overall, we’d still be feeling pretty chipper if we were Newcastle. All things considered.",
      "READ: Ekitike among record signings which will be made this summer after beautiful five-word Ornstein message",
      "",
      "2) Tottenham (1)\nTo those outside Spurs the sheer sense of cathartic relief that still flows around this club after ending that trophy drought may be hard to fathom.",
      "It’s exhausting being the butt of every joke, and that was Spurs’ lot for years and years and years. They are now free of it, at least for a little bit and there is a clear sense of revelling in it.",
      "The club’s official shop is now selling hoodies and t-shirts with ‘Spursy’ and ‘Lads it’s Tottenham’ on. They are one unconvincing 2-1 Champions League win over Juventus away from adding a range of ‘It is the history of the Tottenham’ merch to the burgeoning collection. Their social media content in the aftermath of victory over Manchester United in Bilbao was the 2025 version of Father Ted’s acceptance speech.",
      "It matters. It matters because it strikes to the very heart of being a fan and how you experience it. Spurs’ renewed status as trophy winners has meant that even the initial noise and anger over the brutal sacking of Ange Postecoglou on charges of delivering a succulent 17th-placed finish while ending that trophy drought has now died down.",
      "Sure, that noise will return soon enough if Thomas Frank finds life harder outside of Brentford’s very specific and very different environment, but there are also plenty of encouraging signs around Spurs’ transfer business this summer as they seek to avoid a repeat of last season’s league fiasco in a season where, for the first time in so, so long, they enter into it without the banter monkey upon their back.",
      "And to make things even better for Spurs, the banter monkey has travelled only a few miles down the road to find his latest host.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea (6)\nThey do keep getting cross with us for pointing out that the Club World Cup wasn’t real, but they are absolutely right to revel in it. Revel they must and revel they will in being able to call themselves the first halfway legitimately crowned world champions club football has ever had.",
      "The myriad and often nauseating flaws of the tournament itself, on-field and off, that culminated in Donald Trump apparently believing he’d won the title because he’s just so brilliant at everything can vex and agitate the rest of us, but Chelsea can just enjoy it while the rest of us chew it raw.",
      "And, crucially, the thinly veiled criticisms about how they Southgated their way to the final from the markedly easier side of the draw all melt away in the face of the manner in which they swept away PSG, pretty much everyone’s current idea of the actual best team in the world, in the final.",
      "That was a performance and result that would make any fan giddy. It doesn’t matter whether you think that particular tournament matters or not. The possibilities that have suddenly appeared for a Chelsea side that has underperformed for several years now are intoxicating.",
      "They have had an excellent summer in which their transfer business has, dare we say it, even looked like it might have a plan beyond just stockpiling wingers on eight-year contracts. They’ve bought well and are even looking like they might be selling well.",
      "For the first time in a while, they look like a proper team to be taken entirely seriously. One that can and should compete for all the undoubtedly meaningful trophies available to them next season.",
      "It’s worth remembering that Enzo Maresca had them in a title fight for far longer than anyone really expected last season, and there is now the very real prospect that this could be the latest team given the all-important task that is now so vital to English football’s banter drive: beating Arsenal into second place."

      "Marcus Rashford and Man Utd may agree it’s time to part ways, but their fractious relationship looks set to continue as a clash of priorities has further complicated the England international’s exit from Old Trafford.",
      "The England forward remains determined to leave this summer, and Barcelona is the move he wants. Rashford is said to be “very keen” to joining the La Liga side, with Fabrizio Romano suggesting he’s effectively waiting for them to make it happen.",
      "But the Spanish giants are only in a position to offer a loan deal, and that’s not something Utd are prepared to entertain. Barcelona’s financial situation has already prevented them from registering top target Nico Williams, and although Rashford remains of interest, he is no longer viewed as a priority.",
      "Reports in Spain claim the only deal under consideration is a loan, preferably with no obligation to buy. Man Utd, for their part, are holding out for a sale and have no interest in temporary solutions.",
      "INEOS and Ruben Amorim see Rashford as a valuable asset in their attempt to raise funds and balance PSR obligations. With new signings already arriving, and more expected, Utd want to offload players permanently, and Rashford’s long-term contract gives them little incentive to compromise.",

      "Turkish side Fenerbahce have stepped up their interest, with previous reports claiming Jose Mourinho contacted the player directly and received the “green light” for a reunion. Mourinho, now in charge at Fenerbahce, is said to be keen on a high-profile addition and has instructed club officials to open talks.",
      "But the Metro paint a very different picture. Their latest report suggests Rashford is “not thought to be keen” on the move to Turkey, and remains focused on keeping the Barcelona option alive.",
      "Fenerbahce are reportedly willing to pay around £35 million, a fee that could satisfy Utd, but convincing the player appears to be the bigger obstacle.  They write:",
      "Marcus Rashford is set to be offered the chance to reunite with his former manager Jose Mourinho at Fenerbahce, but he is not thought to be keen on the idea.",
      "BeINSports report that Fenerbahce are ready to make a £35m bid for Rashford, which would be enough to do a deal with Manchester United for the forward.",

      "We’re still waiting on some stragglers and official releases, so do check back for further updates, but here are our objectively correct rankings of the Premier League’s 25/26 home kits for you to enjoy and not get unnecessarily cross about.",
      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",
      "Big themes for this season include: round collars, local ‘inspiration’ and more immediately obvious divergence between ‘replica’ and ‘authentic’ versions of shirts. We’re not really happy about any of those themes, if we’re honest.",
      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",
      "",
      "TBC. Sunderland\nWe’ve seen a few leaks and they’re mainly terrible, but no confirmation yet for what is actually the kit. It’s hummel, so it should be good. Which is the main reason we’re remaining too sceptical to rank based on those current upsetting leaks.",
      "",
      "19) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",

      "The marketing bullsh*t manifests in a vaguely topographical pattern designed to represent the fact that East Lancashire, famously and uniquely, has some hills in it.",
      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

      "And now we don’t know at all. We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm. If we can no longer be sure about sashes on football kits, than what certainties do we have left to cling to?",
      "We don’t think we’re being dramatic when we say this feels like it might be a harbinger of absolute doom for all mankind. Especially in a year that has already featured Spurs winning a trophy and the MCC allowing members not to wear jackets in the Lord’s pavilion just because it was a bit warm.",
      "We expect confirmation that the ravens are leaving the Tower any moment.",
      "And it’s not even like City have plucked a sash from nowhere either. Sure, it’s never been on the home kit before, but they have a proud away-kit sash history that dates well back into the before times of the 1970s and whatnot.",

      "Let’s start with the good. The red and white cuffs and collar are good, as are the pinstripes at the edge of the main stripes. Well done there.",

      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",
      "Just sort of drawing a fake one on sadly reduces a shirt that could have been really good to something approaching a novelty. It’s just a little bit too close to ‘humorous T-shirt with a bow-tie drawn on it’ which is a shame.",
      "",
      "15) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",

      "— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 18, 2025",
      "Yet after last year’s Kappa-coded full navy blue sleeves comes this effort. Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",
      "What we can’t get away from – and no, we can’t fully explain this – is that the specific placement of the navy areas means this shirt is giving Bolton to a distracting degree.",
      "",
      "14) Liverpool\nA return to adidas for Liverpool after many years with Nike and based on the plentiful leaks out there it’s a safety-first start to the rekindled relationship, with a low-risk entirely inoffensive shirt that leans heavily on the 2006/07 classic minus the big ol’ flappy collar.",
      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

      "It’s absolutely adequate based on the leaks we’ve seen. While we’re always slightly reluctant to rank on leaks, we’re confident nothing new we could learn about this kit will propel it up or down this list in any significant way.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nWe will always prefer even stripes which puts this latest Bournemouth effort on the back foot from the start. The sand-effect red stripes are already thicker than the black ones here even before further red bordering is added in. A shame, because it’s actually rather good apart from that.",

      "We’re not even going to bother looking up the PR spiel as it will only annoy us and instead we’ll just go right ahead and assume the sand motif is once again drawing inspiration from the local area and okay, fine, whatever. The gold trim is nicely understated and swerves all accusations of gaudiness. If the thickness of the stripes were sorted out we’d be very happy with this. Not that they asked or care. Honestly, some people.",
      "",
      "11) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

      "10) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",

      "",
      "9) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here if the widespread leaks are anything to go by, with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",

      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "6) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

      "We reserve the right to alter this ranking if the actual shirt disappoints, but at this stage we’re very excited about this one.",
      "",
      "4) West Ham\nUmbro have done some fine retro work with West Ham in recent years, and it all comes together here in this shiny and powerfully early 80s effort. Even the BoyleSports logo looks like it’s from 1983.",

      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "This shirt certainly has that, and perhaps our favourite collar of the entire season’s efforts. In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",
      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",

      "Arsenal are on the verge of finally signing a Proper Striker in Viktor Gyokeres and sorting a priority position. Liverpool and Manchester United are next.",
      "",
      "10) Crystal Palace and a centre-half\nWhile most executives at Selhurst Park are busy scouring their emails for old messages from UEFA and preparing for trips to Lausanne in the coming days, Crystal Palace must soon put down their Evangelos Marinakis voodoo dolls and instead focus on squad-building.",
      "There is admittedly less work than might have been expected by mid-July, whichever European competition the Eagles land in.",
      "For all the frenzied speculation surrounding their most prized assets, Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi, Adam Wharton, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Will Hughes remain.",
      "But there is a need for reinforcements and to push on from a position of strength. The central-defensive cupboards are particularly bare and Guehi’s departure feels inevitably whether this summer or next. Sporting must be too busy counting the Viktor Gyokeres pennies to start negotiating over Ousmane Diomande just yet.",
      "",
      "9) Manchester City and a right-back\nPep Guardiola perhaps didn’t realise he had identified his right-back solution for the best part of the next decade when Manchester City spent £50m to sign Kyle Walker in 2017.",
      "The only other players the Spaniard has signed specifically for that position at the Etihad have largely been lapped by that recovery pace: Danilo was only ever a back-up; Yan Couto never played for the club and Issa Kabore might well follow suit; Joao Cancelo was exceptional for a brief time before being ostracised.",
      "Walker described his exit chat with Guardiola as “not very comfortable” but in outlining a desire for new challenges in January, he spared the manager an even less pleasant conversation this summer.",
      "His decline has been pronounced and with the deposed champions embarking on their most ambitious squad revamp since Guardiola’s first, a shiny new right-back feels like The Final Piece of the Puzzle.",
      "",
      "8) Brentford and a forward\nAmong the many ludicrous numbers supporting Spurs’ choice of Thomas Frank as their new manager is this: in summer 2024 Brentford made Ivan Toney their record sale, spent most of the proceeds on Igor Thiago, saw him play 169 minutes last season due to injury and still enjoyed their best goal return in a single top-flight campaign post-Second World War.",
      "Keith Andrews was responsible for many of those as set-piece coach and it could be that his acumen transfers seamlessly to the role of Frank’s replacement as his first senior managerial post.",
      "But the likelihood remains that Brentford will lose either the fourth or sixth highest scorer in the entire 2024/25 Premier League; it would be a surprise if both Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa remained.",
      "Even in the event that attack is kept intact, Brentford need far more up front. Kevin Schade is the only other vaguely proven option in a department which needs Thiago to hit the ground running without knacking his knee.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds and a keeper\nWhen Leeds chairman Paraag Marathe took the unprecedented step of issuing a vote of confidence in a manager who had just earned Premier League promotion, adding that “we are going to build the best squad that we can with every penny that we’re allowed to spend,” supporters might reasonably have expected more than a freebie and £30m worth of defenders.",
      "Unless the plan was for Sean Longstaff to play in net, as a No. 10 and up front, Leeds need considerably more to compete instead of going into the season with a worse squad than that which Sam Allardyce took down two years ago, which is still really weird.",
      "That new keeper is especially pressing after the mistakes of Illan Meslier mounted to the point Karl Darlow had to drag Leeds over the line in the sodding Championship. Just sign Aaron Ramsdale and perpetuate the curse.",
      "",
      "6) Liverpool and a striker\nWith the ludicrous greed of Newcastle extending beyond selfishly keeping Alexander Isak to signing an option on the next rung down of desirable centre-forwards, Liverpool are a handful of steps away from declaring this the season Darwin Nunez finally comes good.",
      "A record of 40 goals and 26 assists in 143 appearances is far from shameful but a team pursuing trophies on four fronts requires far more consistency and reliability than the Uruguayan can offer.",
      "Liverpool could also do with a centre-half or two but ultimately the modern Premier League title race demands for one contender to Need A Proper Striker, and Arsenal are soon to pass on a baton they picked up from Manchester City years ago.",
      "",
      "5) Bournemouth and a centre-half\nAt least Andoni Iraola is aware that Bournemouth “will not find the same player” as Dean Huijsen, although it would be no disaster to identify another defender they are able to sell on for ludicrous profit within a single season.",
      "The sale of the Spain international and Milos Kerkez – and Paris Saint-Germain’s reluctance to meet the asking price – should preclude the exit of Illia Zabarnyi and subsequent extensive rebuild of Bournemouth’s entire central defence.",
      "But Huijsen alone leaves a substantial enough gap for the Cherries to plug, with more capable cover needed too.",
      "",
      "4) Aston Villa and a right-winger\nThe January transfer window gamble did not pay off. It made Champions League qualification a minimum requirement which proved beyond the competence levels of Emi Martinez and Matty Cash to deliver, and only increased the financial strain.",
      "That has been underlined in a deeply uninspiring start to the summer transfer window. Villa probably need to sell before they sign and the £3.5m generated for Kaine Kesler-Hayden doesn’t even cover Yasin Ozcan’s arrival.",
      "They need a right-back. They need at least one centre-half. They need a significant injection of attacking depth, including more options on either side and competition for Ollie Watkins. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were shiny distractions but only ever for so long.",
      "",
      "3) West Ham and a striker\nThe Prophecy dictates that West Ham always need a new striker. From Mido and Benni McCarthy in the first Sullivan and Gold transfer window to Evan Ferguson in the most recent, the East London graveyard of centre-forward hope has been littered with names over the last decade and a half.",
      "It is uncomfortably revealing that their best striker signing in that time was a left-winger plucked from the Championship and eventually repurposed into an unshiftable channel-running nuisance.",
      "Talks are ongoing with Michail Antonio over a contract renewal but Graham Potter needs far more backing, even if Niclas Fullkrug takes a break from his stint as irascible pundit to nod in a few goals.",
      "",
      "2) Everton and a right-winger\nThe signing of Thierno Barry has addressed one problem position but with a first-team squad currently comprising of about 18 players, Dave can afford to dither no more.",
      "Everton are especially light on numbers in defence, midfield and attack, while Jordan Pickford could probably do with some company too.",
      "But the most shocking aspect of Everton’s squad composition is that Jack Harrison was on loan from Leeds all this sodding time. Can Seamus Coleman play a bit further forward?",
      "",
      "1) Manchester United and a striker\nRuben Amorim has already been failed yet again by Manchester United, who by mid-July have only been able to generate money in the summer transfer window through sell-on clauses on players they offloaded long ago.",
      "Some might prefer to ask questions of how Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Fernandez have found themselves at Champions League sides after being deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, but Manchester United having the foresight to ensure they were covered in that event is a necessary sign of growth and sensibility.",
      "Yet it will barely touch the sides of where that budget needs to go, especially if Brentford continue to inconsiderately want their money’s worth for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Even beyond another addition of a high-performing forward operating in the bottom half, Amorim needs someone capable of leading the line. It feels like a role painfully beyond the current capabilities of Rasmus Hojlund and while Joshua Zirkzee has handled the weight of the shirt far better, the Dutchman’s goal return isn’t close to what the position demands.",
      "The dream scenario is still on: Gyokeres struggles for Arsenal while Benjamin Sesko excels at Manchester United."

      "We’re all of course very much enjoying Manchester United predictably failing to find buyers for the host of forwards they’ve told the world they don’t want, but they’re not alone in struggling to shift attacking talent this summer.",
      "Fortunately for United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle and Arsenal, we’ve come up with a neat five-club forward swap deal to suit (almost) all parties…",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea\nHe’s surely the most No Way Back of all five no-way-backers at Manchester United, and we pray that he’s turning up to his prescribed 5pm bomb-squad training at Carrington donning the Aston Villa Marcus Rashford shirt along with the man himself, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Interest from Napoli has gone quiet and Garnacho’s resisted the temptation to join idol Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr as reports suggest he wants to stay in the Premier League amid interest from Aston Villa and Chelsea, who now look in a good state to receive a so-called ‘bad apple’.",
      "Previous links to Garnacho, last summer and again in January, will have prompted Chelsea fans to wonder whether what they really needed was another mercurial forward yet to prove he’s worth the transfer fee, particularly one with a burgeoning rap sheet of off-field misdemeanours. But Champions League qualification, two major-ish trophies and £30m-odd off the asking price later and they probably think he’s worth the punt.",
      "It’s hard to watch Garnacho and not think he could be brilliant, and if he’s not it doesn’t really matter for Chelsea right now, with Enzo Maresca building quite The Arsenal of attacking players for their inevitable title challenge next season.",
      "",
      "Anthony Gordon to Liverpool\nWhile he’s not thought to be pushing for the Newcastle exit, nor them pushing him, we’re guessing Gordon remains open to the idea of returning to his boyhood club given he couldn’t wait to break the news of his imminent move last summer and told all of his England teammates at Euro 2024 he would be leaving St James’ Park for Anfield before the transfer collapsed.",
      "We’re far from convinced he’s what Liverpool need or whether he could make the step up, but Gordon’s got a knack of smearing egg all over our faces for doubting him and with the added danger of Arne Slot apparently wanting him, we wouldn’t dare to suggest it’s anything other than the perfect transfer.",
      "",
      "Luis Diaz to Arsenal\nDiaz may well win the race with Marcus Rashford to sign for and not be registered by Barcelona, while Bayern Munich are also interested, but Arsenal are also very much in the market for a new left winger.",
      "We of course want this to happen on the proviso that Liverpool then sign Rodrgyo as well as Gordon to boil the utmost Gooners p*ss after their extraordinarily entitled reaction to signing Noni Madueke from Chelsea, the downside being Diaz is a wonderful footballer who would almost certainly be brilliant for them.",
      "",
      "Leandro Trossard to Manchester United\nTrossard has now decided he ‘wants to leave’ Arsenal this summer having presumably signed if not started the #NOTOMADUEKE petition, realising that his game time looks set to be significantly reduced as a result of the Chelsea star joining the club, along with Viktor Gyokeres and likely another forward.",
      "The Manchester United chiefs will pitch that a move to Old Trafford is a more attractive prospect to the Belgian than the inevitable Saudi offer, and even a switch to Fenerbahce to play under Jose Mourinho. And although they would be fighting a losing battle with Bayern Munich should the Bundesliga giants push ahead with a move, it’s a transfer that makes a lot of sense for the Red Devils, if a bit of a disheartening one for Trossard.",
      "He feels like a near-perfect player to operate in one of the inverted winger roles in Ruben Amorim’s infamous 3-4-3, and even assuming they finally secure Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, the Portuguese boss will need players to rotate in those positions with Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount.",
      "And signing Trossard would also grant Amorim the attractive prospect of playing three summer signings in a front trio rather than Rasmus Hojlund or one of the other deplorable options already tarred by the Old Trafford brush.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku to Newcastle\nReports suggest success with an ‘official bid’ for Hugo Ekitike would render this entirely moot as Newcastle insist they want an £86m striker to rotate with Alexander Isak rather than replace him, but if we lift the wool from over our eyes we’re comfortable in the belief that Eddie Howe may actually need another forward to rotate with Ekitike. He could sign both and still have change to spare.",
      "Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Liverpool all retain a belief that there’s A Footballer In There despite Nkunku offering remarkably little evidence in his two-year stint at Chelsea, and the Frenchman may well look at Newcastle, with Champions League football and Howe’s standout record of improving players, as an excellent landing spot this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘ready to lower’ Alejandro Garnacho’s ‘asking price’ after he decided to ‘reject’ one exit route.",

      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",

      "“I saw Freddie Ljungberg giving a hell of a lot of problems to Martin Keown while watching him on television as he played for Sweden against England. I decided to buy him then,” the legendary Arsenal manager once said of a Euro 2000 qualifier in which Keown categorically did not feature.",
      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",
      "",
      "5) Ashley Cole\nBy the time Cole left Chelsea for Roma after winning seven trophies in eight years, the pawn in the controversial move which saw him swap a fading force for one just establishing itself was retiring from the game completely.",
      "Arsenal wanted £25m for their starting left-back at the start of summer 2006; they eventually relented and settled for £5m plus William Gallas.",
      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off. They certainly benefited from a situation of their own making with Cole, whose bridges back to Arsenal had been summarily torched, but still.",

      "4) David de Gea\nIt might not be entirely accurate but it does feel as though De Gea single-handedly prevented Manchester United from enduring as catastrophic a season as their most recent on multiple occasions over a 12-year tenure.",
      "He was the original Bruno Fernandes, a tangibly better player than most if not all his teammates yet bizarrely keen to sacrifice the best years of his career to a failing institution. Once that fax machine faltered in 2015 it seemed as though De Gea just accepted his fate as a Manchester United lifer.",
      "The club never was going to show that same loyalty as soon as the Spaniard became dispensable and their handling of his exit was amateurish. But there was a time – after a rough initiation period – when Manchester United almost accidentally possessed the finest keeper in the world.",
      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",
      "Manchester City collapsed without Rodri in 2024/25 and ongoing negotiations over a substantial pay rise suggest they know precisely how important a role he plays.",
      "",
      "2) Roy Keane\nIt takes a certain type of character to jump from Brian Clough to Alex Ferguson while infuriating Kenny Dalglish in between, but as Keane himself would say, he was just doing his job as the most sought-after midfielder of a generation.",
      "If Blackburn had filed their paperwork properly and Dalglish not taken a sunny July weekend off in 1993, the first Premier League crown under Ferguson might have been marked by no Manchester United incomings whatsoever. But it opened the door to a record-breaking hijack which shaped the club’s future and heralded a glittering and often contemptuous spell.",

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders but their business might be almost done now.",
      "",
      "9) Arsenal – £75m\nReports suggest that the Gunners paid £60m for Martin Zubimendi in the end, and we’re adding a few quid for Kepa from Chelsea, because Arsenal always have to buy somebody from Chelsea. And then a tenner for Christian Norgaard.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Como – £76.7m\nThe richest club in Serie A are determined to spend money to secure European football for next season. Jesus Rodriguez is the most expensive of those to arrive so far.",
      "",
      "7) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "",
      "6) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "4) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus has shot Spurs up into the top three here and Morgan Gibbs-White will get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."
