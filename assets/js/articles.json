      "Barcelona sporting director Deco has admitted that they are interested in both Liverpool winger Luis Diaz and Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer. The summer transfer window is now just around the corner and Barca are weighing up moves for some high-profile targets.",
      "Diaz has been strongly linked with a move to La Liga this summer, with Arne Slot keen to refresh his attack. Both Diaz and Darwin Nunez could be on the move once the window opens, with Barca keen on Diaz and Atletico Madrid eyeing Nunez.",
      "Liverpool are yet to agree new terms with Diaz, whose current deal expires in June 2027, and Barca are lurking. Diaz’s father has previously said it would be a “dream” for his son to join the Catalan giants, although the winger has reaffirmed his happiness on Merseyside after winning the Premier League.",
      "Rashford, meanwhile, is poised to make a permanent move away from Manchester United following a successful loan spell with Aston Villa. He is understood to prefer a move to Barcelona ahead of a transfer to Villa or another Premier League rival.",
      "It seems he could get his wish, given Deco’s comments. \"We like Luis, we like Rashford, and we like other players,\" Deco told Catalan radio station RAC 1. \"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",
      "Barca announced a new contract until June 2028 for Raphinha on Thursday after a stunning campaign has seen him contribute 34 goals and 25 assists in 56 games. And securing their other key players remains the first priority for Hansi Flick’s side.",
      "\"If we can keep the core of the team together, that's what we want,\" Deco said. \"I think we can do it. I think you can always improve the team, but you have to understand what kind of player you need. We've focused first on what we have at home and renewals.",
      "\"The renewals of Raphinha, [Frenkie] De Jong, and Eric [Garcia] will come, for sure. That's the priority. We'll talk about improving the team if we can, but the key is stability. We don't believe that players will ask to leave.\"",
      "Barca are keen to reinforce their squad, though, with Robert Lewandowski heading into the final year of his contract. Luckily, they have a generational talent on their books in the form of Lamine Yamal, who Deco says has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain. Unsurprisingly, Barca would never consider selling. Instead they are plotting a new contract.",
      "\"Lamine has not asked for anything because we don't speak to players but to agents,\" he said. \"That's not his priority. I think a player has to have a contract that is fair, that corresponds to his value and I think that's what we're going to do.",
      "“You have to adapt Lamine's contract to his reality. He has to be the most important player among the most important players we have. He surely has other things that the others don't have.\""

      "Alan Shearer has tipped Ruben Amorim to leave Manchester United in the wake of their defeat in the Europa League final. United were beaten by Tottenham on Wednesday night in Bilbao.",
      "The 40-year-old has won just 16 of the 41 games he has taken of since replacing Erik ten Hag in November. He even admitted after Wednesday's defeat that he would be happy to leave his post should the board decide he is not the right man for the job.",
      "While it is understood that United bosses are content with Amorim for now, Shearer is unconvinced over his long-term future. The Newcastle legend has delivered a scathing assessment of the current state of the club.",
      "And he believes things are so bad at Old Trafford that Amorim could even move on this summer. Shearer insisted that Amorim did not realise the scale of the challenge that was facing him, but admitted United had become 'much worse'.",
      "\"There will be a lot of questions around Ruben Amorim’s future now and very much like the Spurs situation, it wouldn't surprise me if he wasn't the manager at the beginning of the season. Whether that's his choice or not, I guess,\" he told Betfair.",
      "\"I've said it so many times, there's no way he's gone into that football club and expected what he found. There's no way he thought it was that bad. He couldn't have, because I'm not sure you'd go. He hasn't helped the situation.",
      "\"They've actually got so much worse under him. It might have been papering over the cracks if they had won the Europa League, but their problems were summed up in that 97 minutes: no creativity, no legs, no energy, no goals, and a complete mess.\"",
      "Shearer believes that it will be incredibly difficult for United to turn their fortunes around quickly. He made an early predicition that next season will be another campaign without any silverware for the Red Devils.",
      "\"It's a mess at Manchester United. Much like Spurs, their season was this competition. We've been seeing it for the last two or three months that both clubs needed to win this competition to salvage something from their season,\" Shearer added.",
      "\"Financially, it will hurt them to attract the players they wanted because they're not Man United from 20 years ago, where most players wanted to go there. They're not that football club anymore; they're only that club by name.",
      "\"They don't deserve to win the Europa League or be in the Champions League. They've been awful all season in every department. The final basically just summed up their season as a whole: slow, terrible in front of the goal, no threat, no energy, and really poor.",
      "\"Are they going to be in the market for top players now? Top players want to play in the Champions League and challenge for trophies. Are Man United going to be challenging for trophies next season? I think the simple answer is no, they're not.\""

      "Manchester United are at rock bottom following their miserable defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final. For the pessimists there is more misery on the horizon, but for the optimists it means the only way is up.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens this summer, with an absolutely crucial transfer window on the horizon. United know they need to make wholesale changes – and that’s why Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken the unprecedented step of placing the entire squad at risk of being sold.",
      "Nobody is above the axe of Ratcliffe, who has already made hundreds of United staff redundant and has made it very clear that he’s not motivated by winning popularity contests. The sign has been put into the front lawn: United are clearing out their garage and everyone has a price. Let the bidding commence.",
      "United paid Inter Milan £43million for Onana. He’s coming up to two years as United’s number one and it’s clear that it just hasn’t worked out. His fated ability to play out from the back hasn’t had any tangible benefit and, instead, we’ve been treated to the occasional howler. Yet he is still one of the players who has some sell-on value, so make the most of it. SELL.",
      "Hard to judge the Turkish keeper, who has only played 10 times for United in two seasons. When he has played, like in the 4-1 defeat by Newcastle in April, he didn’t cover himself in glory, making a dreadful error. But, to be brutally honest, United have bigger fish to fry than their second-choice goalkeeper. KEEP.",
      "Look up ‘good man to have around the dressing room’ in the football cliche dictionary and it is likely that Heaton will be cited. But at 39 years old, and with his contract about to expire, the time has come to hang up your boots, Tom. RELEASE.",
      "The Swede has been at United since 2017 and if we’re being brutally honest – which we are – he has never really been good enough to be a mainstay at such a club. With his contract up on June 30, his final act as a United player will be getting a yellow card for shouting at the fourth official in Bilbao. RELEASE.",
      "One of the summer arrivals in Erik ten Hag’s ill-fated final transfer window. A solid if unspectacular defender, who does have the benefit of being able to play in a few positions. Does he have the legs to play as a wingback in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation? I’m not convinced, but we can’t flog everyone. KEEP.",
      "Has had an injury-hit debut campaign with United and looks a long way off the much-hyped Ajax youngster of his heyday. He cost United £42.9m from Bayern Munich in the summer and is a classic example of their poor recruitment. SELL.",
      "I love Maguire. But watching him flail around in the Spurs penalty area, desperately trying to affect the game, while fighting with Cristian Romero, looked a lot like the death knell of a football team. Amorim essentially put the big lad up top and hoped. It is time to move on from Maguire. SELL.",
      "It feels like a long, long time since we were debating whether a 5ft 9in centre-back could hack it in the Greatest League In the World™. The diminutive defender has been out injured for some time, which has the effect of increasing his stock during miserable times like these. KEEP.",
      "Coming to a quiz near you as a pointless answer in about 10 years. SELL.",
      "Signed in January, Dorgu has at times looked like the sort of left wing-back Amorim requires. He has the athleticism to get up and down the wing, a solid left foot and appears to have a pretty high ceiling. KEEP.",
      "United beat Real Madrid to the signing of Yoro, but have been dismayed to see him injured for much of this season. Still only 19 years old, the Frenchman needs to stay injury-free and have some stability around him. KEEP.",
      "Injuries have taken their toll on Shaw, who is United’s longest-serving current player having joined the club way back in 2014. It is crazy that he still has two years left on his deal. Ratcliffe is not afraid of taking tough decisions and getting rid of the England defender is one that needs doing. SELL.",
      "Has been one of the strong performers over the past few seasons and appears to be a good fit for Amorim’s tactical system. Dalot also seems like a leader in the dressing room – and considering I’m getting rid of a lot of them – he is worth keeping. KEEP.",
      "One of few bright lights in a dark, dark season. Heaven was pinched from Arsenal and showed plenty of promise when he played. KEEP.",
      "A veteran player who has been a model professional for United. But he’s 37 years old and out of contract next month. RELEASE.",
      "The young defender has broken into the first team this season and is one of a few players who is flying the flag for the famous United academy. KEEP.",
      "Pre-season will be indicative for Fredricson, who like Amass has got a taste of first-team football. Amorim will know whether he has a shot, but a loan spell might be more appropriate. KEEP.",
      "Judged by numbers only, Mount has been a dreadful buy for £55m. He has four goals and one assist in 45 appearances for United. But, now he’s fit again, he needs to kick on and prove himself as a No.10 in Amorim’s shape. There is absolutely no chance United can sell him, so they better hope he turns up next season. KEEP.",
      "Right then. United’s best player and captain. The source of 19 goals and 19 assists this season. But also a player who has concrete interest from the Saudi Pro League. I would take the gamble and sell up. United need to change their culture and – rightly or wrongly – Fernandes has become the embodiment of their malaise. He will fetch a good price and, considering he turns 31 in September, it could prove smart business in hindsight. The only problem is replacing him without the allure of European football… SELL.",
      "A very very simple decision. Hasn’t been good enough for about two years. A player well past his peak. Thankfully, his contract is up. RELEASE.",
      "The man referenced by Ratcliffe as embodying the wasteful recruitment model of the United of old. The former Real Madrid man is past his best and the image of him running through quicksand, trying to catch up to Spurs players on the break, will stick with me. Off he goes to Saudi Arabia. SELL.",
      "United went through an awful lot of faff to sign Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer and didn’t get much for their £50m. However, the Uruguay international cannot be written off yet. He has the right profile to replace Casemiro and should be given the chance to step up. KEEP.",
      "Like everyone else in the squad, Mainoo is up for sale, but really he shouldn’t be. He is a talented young Mancunian who represents a link to the club’s fans. He is a supremely gifted youngster with the ability to develop into a great box-to-box midfielder. He just needs to be managed well and not burdened. KEEP.",
      "I’m not sure that Collyer has the ability to make a mark on United next season. SELL.",
      "The fact he was loaned out to Rotherham in January says a lot. SELL.",
      "I feel sorry for Hojlund. He clearly isn’t a £72m player. He should not be burdened with the goalscoring demands that come with being United’s first-choice No.9. The Dane is too inexperienced for the role he’s inherited. He should either be an understudy to an experienced striker, or sold to sign such a player. Reports in Italy suggest United could flog him back to where he came from. If that doesn’t happen then he can take up the role he should’ve had in the first place. KEEP.",
      "There is no going back from December when Amorim froze him out. He wants a new challenge and should be given it, with his spell on loan at Aston Villa doing his sale value no harm. SELL.",
      "United’s interest in Matheus Cunha is not good news for Zirkee, who is at his best dropping off the back line into space. The difference is Cunha is more talented and has scored a lot more goals this season for Wolves. Zirkzee may still have admirers abroad. United should call them up. SELL.",
      "One of few success stories from a terrible spell of recruitment. The young winger is a joy to watch and, if he hadn’t been injured this season, could have led United to a few more wins (just remember how good that last-minute Manchester Derby winner was). KEEP.",
      "Garnacho strongly hinted at a summer departure in the wake of the defeat by Spurs. He has been linked with Chelsea and Napoli and, to be frank, United should cash in because his end product is severely lacking. He has six goals and two assists in 36 Premier League appearances. Get rid. SELL.",
      "The Brazilian has turned into a different player since joining Real Betis on loan, but it would be foolish to think he would simply bring that form to Old Trafford if United recalled him. It would be much wiser to cut your losses on the £82m Ten Hag flop. SELL.",
      "Wayne Rooney said he felt sorry for Obi when watching him play against Brentford recently, with United showing no idea of how to utilise the youngster. The hope is that, with better team-mates, he can come good. KEEP.",
      "Another tale of waste at United. Sancho cost £73m from Borussia Dortmund but never got close to repaying that fee. He hasn’t done an awful lot on loan at Chelsea, but luckily they have an obligation to buy the winger. SELL."

      "The result helped to salvage a season which has seen Spurs endure their worst domestic season in almost 50 years. Going into the final game of the Premier League season, the North Londoners are 17th in the table, having slumped to a staggering 21 league defeats.",
      "It now remains to be seen whether their European exploits will be enough to convince Daniel Levy that Postecoglou deserves a third season in the Spurs dugout. But the Daily Mail reports that Tottenham ’s players do not expect that to happen, with a change now deemed more likely.",
      "The report adds that alternatives to Postecoglou are already being discussed by Levy, with Fulham boss Marco Silva one of the names in the frame this summer. Brennan Johnson, who was credited with the winning goal over United, suggested that winning the trophy would be the perfect ‘mic drop’ for the manager.",
      "Captain Son Heung-min made it clear that he wants the 59-year-old to stay with the club. He said: “He won the trophy. Nobody else did it, so - look, it’s not up to me or the players, but we just have to look at the facts.",
      "“At the fact that we hadn’t won in 17 years, but this is the day we finally won it. It’s the manager who wins the trophy. So we'll see what’s going to happen.”",

I just have to be very thankful to him for how much he believed since day one, since he wanted me to sign for the club.",

The decision by Whiteside and his wife, Dee, to not renew their season tickets comes a year after they were forced to move their seats at Old Trafford to accommodate executive seating.",
      "In a post on X, Dee Whiteside expressed her disappointment: \"So, I've waited for a while to write this. It is with unbelievable sadness, that after more than 28 years of having season tickets at Old Trafford, @NormanWhiteside and I are not renewing next year.",
      "\"And to cap it all, we've seen it all, we've won the lot, we're Man United and we're never gonna stop... except for so many seasons now, my match-going loyalty to my club has ended so sadly.",
      "\"I'll still be at games, I'm MUFC until I die, and I've seen worse times than now, but I'm not sure I've seen players less interested in pulling on our shirt for very many years. Times must change.\"",
      "Whiteside and his wife, are platinum season ticket holders at Old Trafford, by virtue of having the seats for more than 25 years, but will now walk away. United's decision to move season ticket holders from block S122 at Old Trafford was reported by the MEN last year, a change that impacted the Whitesides.",

      "\"There are various reasons why this happens, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders - in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.\"",
      "During his tenure in Manchester, Whiteside set records as the youngest player to score in both FA Cup and League Cup finals. The Northern Irishman also surpassed Pele's record to become the youngest player to participate in a World Cup, representing his country at the tender age of 17 years and 40 days.",
      "Injury forced Whiteside to retire at just 26, but he remains a beloved figure among fans for his contributions, particularly his match-winning goal against Everton in the 1985 FA Cup final."

      "Bruno Fernandes has been offered an exit route from Manchester United after their defeat in the Europa League final. United are braced for sweeping changes in the summer transfer window after missing out on Champions League football next season by losing to Tottenham – and their captain could be among those leaving.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is ready to take a brutal stance this summer in order to furnish Ruben Amorim with a fresh squad for the 2025/26 season. United want to bring in Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and Ipswich striker Liam Delap, but only have around £100million to spend before taking into account sales.",
      "Fernandes is under contract with United until June 2027, while the club also have the option of a further year. But the 30-year-old admitted in the aftermath of defeat in Bilbao that he would understand if United sold him – and that has now become a real possibility.",
      "That approach was rejected by his representatives, but Al-Hilal have not given up and Fernandes’ honest comments to the media in northern Spain will have given them hope a deal can be reached.",
      "“If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this,” he said.",
      "“I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.”",
      "Fernandes joined United in January 2020 from Sporting Lisbon for £68million and has been a key player ever since. He has contributed 98 goals and 86 assists in 289 appearances for the club and has been captain since Erik ten Hag replaced Harry Maguire two summers ago.",
      "He has been United’s stand-out performer this season with 19 goals and 19 assists in 56 appearances. But with United 16th in the Premier League and facing a year without any European football, Ratcliffe is ready to oversee a brutal fire sale this summer.",
      "While loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are the primary targets for sales, there is a feeling that the club will have to offload some key players too. Amorim has described Fernandes as one of the best players in the world and dismissed previous rumours around him, but the decision could be taken out of his hands this summer."

      "However, all too often he has drifted in and out of games, while his abject performance in the Europa League final may live long in the memory. The club may look to cash in while he's still young, but it seems unlikely another Premier League team would take a punt on him.",

      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is,\" he said after the defeat to Spurs. \"Football sometimes is like this. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.\"",

      "Top target Matheus Cunha plays further forward at Wolves. He is due to cost United as much as £62.5m – his release clause figure – and it remains to be seen what United's budget for the summer will be beyond that.",

      "Tottenham’s victory in the Europa League final has been recognised in UEFA’s official team of the tournament. Spurs beat Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao on Wednesday night to secure their first trophy since 2008 and to vindicate under-pressure manager Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Brennan Johnson’s scrappy goal just before half-time was enough for Spurs to end their 17-year wait for a major trophy and ensure United ended their miserable season on a new low. United dominated the ball but could not break down a determined low block from Spurs.",
      "When they did fashion chances, they found Guglielmo Vicario in decent form, with the goalkeeper keeping out efforts from Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw. Postecoglou is known for implementing an expansive playing style, but he took a much more pragmatic approach in the San Mames and was rewarded with his customary trophy in his second season.",
      "Tottenham’s players were seen dancing with joy and sharing the moment with their supporters – and four of them have now been given another honour. UEFA have announced their team of the Europa League and Spurs’ impressive rear guard in the final has been recognised.",
      "Spurs kept six clean sheets during the competition and Vicario has been named the best keeper in the competition. Right-back Pedro Porro was the team’s biggest threat against United, swinging in lots of good crosses, while he dealt well with Mason Mount and Garnacho in defence.",
      "He is joined in the team of the tournament by captain-for-the-night Cristian Romero, who has the extra honour of being the player of the tournament. The combative Argentine was in the thick of things in Bilbao, battling with Harry Maguire in the closing stages.",
      "Finally, the Spurs contingent is completed by striker Dominic Solanke, who worked tirelessly up front in the final. He finished the competition with five goals and four assists in 13 appearances, justifying the club-record £65million Spurs paid Bournemouth for his services.",
      "It won’t come as any consolation to them right now, but United’s defeated finalists have two inclusions in the form of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. The duo formed United’s midfield against Spurs, and although they came up short, they were the most consistent performers in the rest of the tournament.",
      "Frankfurt defender Robin Koch, Bodo/Glimt pair Fredrik Andre Bjorkan and Patrick Berg, Lyon star Rayan Cherki and Athletic Club’s Nico Williams complete the line-up. Cherki scored in both games against United and has been linked with a summer transfer.",
      "The Lyon forward is reportedly being eyed by five Premier League clubs after racking up 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances in all competitions. Meanwhile, Williams is a long-term target of Arsenal.",

This Thursday, we're featuring everything from the shock news that Labour are exploring mandatory castration in a brutal paedophile crackdown to Man Utd's financial woes after losing the Europa League final.",
      "Late last night, news broke that Labour were exploring mandatory chemical castration for paedophiles and rapists under plans to curb sex offenders' vile urges. Elsewhere, it was revealed Manchester United will listen to offers for every player in the wake of their European defeat and two CBB stars finally confirmed their rumoured romance.",

      "A voluntary scheme will see sex offenders chemically castrated in two regions in England, covering 20 prisons, as a first step to rolling out nationwide. But Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is also exploring whether the approach could be made mandatory, rather than just voluntary.",
      "A major review of sentencing, chaired by former Justice Secretary David Gauke and published today, called for more evidence to be gathered on chemical castration - a drug treatment that reduces hormone levels to curb libido.

      "The crushing 1-0 loss to Tottenham in Bilbao saw United blow a place in next season's Champions League - and with it £100million in revenue. Defeat to Spurs means United will not play in Europe at all next season, for only the second time in 35 years and means further cutbacks at the club that has already seen mass redundancies",
      "United's failure in Bilbao means they also face missing out on signing their top summer targets, including Liam Delap, Matheus Cunha and Victor Osimhen.

A UK autopsy revealed doctors had removed her heart without her family's knowledge.",

      "If Alejandro Garnacho has to apologise for his abrupt comments on Ruben Amorim's team selection, it will not be the first time the Manchester United forward has been in this position. Garnacho, 20, was clearly furious with Amorim after the Europa League final.",
      "The Argentinian winger was named on the bench for the 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao. Amorim did introduce the United academy graduate for Mason Mount, but not until the 71st minute.",
      "The South American was evidently not satisfied with the amount of time he was given to make an impact, as after the match, he lambasted the United head coach for leaving him out of the starting XI. He also described his side's campaign as \"s***\".",
      "It's not the first time Garnacho has criticised his manager, though. He was previously reprimanded by Erik ten Hag, after he was caught engaging with a social media post criticising the Dutchman. Garnacho 'liked' a tweet on X – formerly known as Twitter – that slated Ten Hag for hooking the forward off at half time during United's 2-2 away draw with Bournemouth last season.",
      "When asked about the matter later on, Ten Hag drew a line under the situation and said: \"Alejandro is a young player, he has to learn a lot. He apologised for it and after that we move on.\"",
      "Just over a year later, Garnacho has found himself in the headlines for criticising his boss again. Instead of liking a post, the 20-year-old spoke to the media after the final in Bilbao, and said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Making matters worse, his brother Roberto backed up his sibling on social media in a dig at Amorim. He took to Instagram and wrote: \"Working as no-one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe hahahahahaha.\"",
      "It remains to be seen if Amorim responds to Garnacho's comments and those of his brother, but he will likely be quizzed on the matter on Friday in his pre-match press conference. United host Aston Villa at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday – their final match of the campaign.",
      "Amorim, however, defended his decision to snub the Argentine to begin with in Bilbao and deploy Mount in his position instead.",
      "The Portuguese boss even had a dig at Garnacho himself when he said: \"How many times have we had this conversation, and it was the opposite? Some players come in, like Mason Mount, against Bilbao and changed the game.",
      "\"So now it is easy to say. Who missed the big opportunity in the first half against Bilbao? Yeah [Garnacho]. Of course, now it is easy for us to talk about a lot of views.\"",
      "Garnacho was heavily linked with moves to Napoli and Chelsea in January, but neither deal materialised. His future could now well depend on Amorim's reaction to his public comments and his brother's post, with a sale still very possible in the summer, especially after United made every player available for the right price off the back of their damaging defeat to Spurs.",

      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot has become a Premier League champion at the first time of asking, and points to one of the Reds' first games of the season as a key moment. Slot had big shoes to fill after replacing long-serving boss Jurgen Klopp, but a subtle tweak he made in just the third game of the season had a big impact.",
      "After beginning the season with 2-0 victories over Ipswich and Brentford, Liverpool faced a big early test with a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United. A 3-0 win kept up their perfect start, though, while accelerating the United decline which saw Erik ten Hag sacked in Octoner.",
      "Liverpool's victory owed a lot to Slot putting Dominik Szoboszlai directly up against Casemiro. United's Brazilian midfielder had a torrid time, leaving the field at half-time, and the visitors were never in any real danger during their victory.",
      "\"Just recently some Dutch media asked me: ‘What was the game where you probably won the players over?’ I think it was this game because we changed some small details in the way we did our build up,\" Slot told The Athletic",
      "\"I said to them that United would be expecting Dominik Szoboszlai to play on the right. That they will have prepared all week for it, but he’s going to play on the left and we’re going to do this, this and this a bit different. Indeed exactly what I said happened.\"",
      "Liverpool were 2-0 up at the break after a Luis Diaz break and extended their advantage 10 minutes into the second half through Mohamed Salah. Slot's team lost their next league game, at home to Nottingham Forest, but then went on an unbeaten league run which lasted until April.",
      "\"Did we win the game because of that reason? No. We scored two counter-attacks, maybe even three!\" Slot added. \"But I think it was a day when the players thought: ‘Oh, what he’s trying to tell us works’. And to win 3-0 at Old Trafford gave us the confidence that there was maybe something special ahead of us.\"",
      "Since clinching the title with a 5-1 victory over Tottenham at the end of April, Liverpool have gone three games without a win. They have a chance to go out on a high, though, with Crystal Palace visiting Anfield for the final game of the season.",
      "\"It's going to be a completely different game than the one tonight,\" Slot told Match of the Day when asked about the finale after Monday's 3-2 loss at Brighton. \"You saw Brighton want to press us high and bring the ball out from the back but if Palace play like their cup final then we'll have more possession than tonight but it's very difficult to play through them.\""

      "It appears Garnacho just can’t help himself when it comes to social media. After being taken off at half-time in a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth last year, he ‘liked’ a series of negative posts about then-manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "With Ten Hag under mounting pressure before a surprise FA Cup final win over Manchester City, Garnacho’s apparent willingness to undermine his manager reminded many of Sir Alex Ferguson’s sage words from his autobiography. The club’s greatest manager wrote: \"There is a phrase in football about players 'not playing for the manager,' which I have seen happen a thousand times.",
      "\"Once that happens, the manager is as good as dead, because he has failed in his major undertaking, which is to motivate the players to follow him.\"",
      "While Ten Hag survived the summer, he was sacked in October, although the arrival of Amorim has clearly not quelled Garnacho's outspokenness.",
      "More tension between Garnacho and United surfaced when the club refused his request to represent his country at the Paris Olympics, as it would have led to him missing the start of the Premier League season.",
      "United stood firm despite Garnacho pleading his case in person to Ten Hag, whose stance can perhaps be understood as he desperately needed a strong start to the season after finishing eighth in 2023/24.",
      "Garnacho’s representatives aren’t afraid to speak their minds either, and it doesn’t just to apply to United matters. In 2023, agent Enrique de Lucas let rip at the Spanish Football Federation after his player opted to switch his allegiance to Argentina, having represented Spain at youth level.",
      "De Lucas hit out at “bad politics” as he told Ole : “I think that Spain is a closed issue and there is no hiding it. Very bad management by the Spanish Federation, I don’t know who, or I can guess who, but very bad management or very bad politics. And I think Garna is not going to be the only case in which a player with dual nationality could lose, I honestly tell you.",
      "“And he decides to go with Argentina because he really feels it. For him it has not been a trauma at all, quite the contrary. When that possibility opens up for him, imagine, being able to play with a team like Argentina, all his maternal family, his grandparents, he has felt them since he was littleand for him it’s not a problem, it’s a blessing.”",
      "Roberto also has a history of fiery statements. He once let rip at fans after his sibling’s goal against Wolves in May 2023, which came after Garnacho had been criticised on social media. Roberto blasted to one social media user: “Apologise as much as you disrespected, b******.”"

      "Manchester United are going ahead with a team barbecue - despite their crushing Europa League final defeat.",
      "United said they would hold a barbecue for players and staff after the Europa League final, rather than hold an open-top bus parade if they beat Tottenham in Bilbao. Despite losing 1-0 to Ange Postecoglou’s side in the San Mames Stadium, United are understood to have decided to go ahead with the barbecue at the club’s Carrington training ground, for players, their families and staff.",
      "United have endured their worst-ever Premier League season, losing 18 games to stand 16th in the table, with no European football next season, following the defeat to Spurs in northern Spain.",
      "Club chiefs are also standing behind head coach Ruben Amorim. United’s meek 1-0 defeat compounded their worst top-flight campaign since relegation 51 years ago – a point above victors Spurs – heading into Sunday’s season finale at home to Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim has overseen just six Premier League wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November and admitted after Wednesday’s costly defeat he would walk away without compensation if the club or fans wanted him to.",
      "Heading into the final, it was believed the Portuguese had the club’s full support irrespective of the outcome and he indeed retains the backing of the hierarchy despite the painful loss in Spain.",
      "Several United players emphatically threw their support behind Amorim after the drab defeat, with Bruno Fernandes saying he was “the right man” for what the club still see as a longer-term project. United's skipper was left distraught by the defeat and admitted he could be sold by club bosses this summer",
      "Luke Shaw said the candid coach is “100 per cent the right person” to oversee a change in “mindset” and “standards”, with fellow full-back Diogo Dalot offering similar support.",
      "“I’m 100 per cent sure that he’s the right man for us because I see it every day,” the United defender said. “The standards that he has, what he demands from us, the view that he has for the club, for the players, for the coaching staff.",
      "“A lot of changes are happening at the same time, but ultimately it’s going to be what we do on the pitch. We have to take responsibility from that. Nobody apart from us is going on to the pitch and trying to get results.”"

      "As the final whistle sounded in the San Mames Stadium on Wednesday evening, Tottenham Hotspur were crowned Europa League champions, while Manchester United were hit with a new and harsh reality. United were toothless and uninspired as they let Spurs clinch their first major trophy since 2008.",
      "The scrappy 1-0 victory also gifted Ange Postecolou the added dusting of Champions League football for next season. Ruben Amorim's side will now walk away from the 2024/2025 season having failed to capture any silverware, and there is a real threat that they now could finish as low as 17th in the table if results don't go their way this weekend.",
      "As United desperately attempt to stave off humiliation on the Premier League's final day on Sunday, just a few miles up the East Lancs Road, Liverpool will be lifting their 20th top-flight trophy. What this all could mean for United's pull in the transfer market is largely unprecedented.",
      "With no European football to offer, as well as the financial implications that Wednesday's loss brings, even the most ardent of United loyalists will find themselves concerned.",
      "Liverpool, however, now look like they're prepared to sit at Europe's top-table when it comes to transfers, and it seems the Red Devils have been left to feast on their scraps.",
      "Reports suggest that United have entered the race for Lyon winger Rayan Cherki. The 21-year-old French star was thought to be a target for Arne Slot, however Liverpool are now thought to have pivoted their attention to one of the most in-demand players on the continent in the shape of Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.",
      "The reality of United now chasing their fiercest rivals' back-up transfer options will be an uncomfortable truth and a bitter pill for the Old Trafford faithful to swallow. But it's just another blow to suck up as they are forced to sit back and watch as the Anfield outfit reascend the very perch that Sir Alex Ferguson gleefully knocked them off years ago.",
      "Slot's achievement this season also means Liverpool have accumulated 47 major trophies in England, ranking them as the country's most successful club, while United remain on 44 - the stuff of nightmares for those on the red side of Manchester.",
      "However, they are still United in name and, regardless of the woes they are traversing, good players will come. United are believed to be confident of signing Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and they are also heavily interested in Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap.",
      "Before their Europa League final crash-out, Amorim confirmed that the club did have a contingency in place should they lose, but he didn't shy away from what defeat would ultimately mean.",
      "\"We have two plans even for the market,\" he said. \"And we need to understand that is tough for a club like us not to be in the Champions League.\"",
      "With Bayern Munich offering heavyweight competition for Wirtz's signature, Liverpool are likely to have to fork out a club-record fee to bring him to Anfield.",
      "Yet even if Wirtz remains elusive, Liverpool's closing in on the signing of Leverkusen full-back Jeremie Frimpong, while being linked with players such as Atletico Madrid's Julien Alvarez and Bournemouth's exciting left-back Milos Kerkez should send shockwaves through United.",
      "Because there is reason to think that the changing of the guard, from the Red Devils to the Reds, is perhaps here to stay for some time."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was reportedly booed by Manchester United staff after he appeared on screen following the Europa League final. United were beaten in the Europa League final by Tottenham on Wednesday night to cap a miserable season.",
      "This is Ratcliffe's first full season as the Red Devils' controlling co-owner. He has enacted a brutal round of job cuts since taking over from the Glazers, with 250 staff already departing.",
      "A further round of redundancies is expected to come over the summer, while club legends have seen their ambassador contracts ended. Ratcliffe also decided against inviting any staff members to Bilbao to watch the final in person.",
      "Instead, United set up a screening of the game back in Manchester. The club's staff watched on as Ruben Amorim's men were unable to recover after going behind to Brennan Johnson's scrappy first-half goal.",
      "To complete the humiliation for Ratcliffe, he was in attendance at the San Mames Stadium. The British billionaire was handed the job of giving out the medals alongside Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.",
      "As a result of that job, Ratcliffe was seen on camera several times. According to The Athletic, that led to staff at the screening in Manchester booing whenever Ratcliffe and fellow owner Avram Glazer appeared on the screen.",
      "The 1,000-strong crowd was made up of employees and family members. The booing rang out once during the game and again at full-time, with the mood with trendy venue Direcast described as being 'very sombre'.",
      "Staff at Old Trafford have been growing increasingly concerned after chief executive Omar Berrada revealed in February that a second redundancy round would be based on qualifying for the Europa League for the next four seasons.",
      "One man who has admitted he could find himself out of a job is boss Amorim. The 40-year-old has admitted he would be happy to depart without compensation should Ratcliffe decide he is not the man for the job.",
      "\"It's in the future, I'm not going to talk about the future. This loss, the pain of losing this match. I can see it was clear, we were the better team but then we managed not to score again, so it's very hard to win football matches,\" he said.",
      "\"But the guys tried everything to win the game. In the future, we will have time to assess everything. We have to see. We have to see. I know everything that you did [say], I said before you. In this moment, I’m not going to be here defending myself. It’s not my style.",

      "\"Again, I’m really confident about my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things. I think I was always really honest with you guys. We didn’t perform perfect today, but we were better than the opponent, and the opponent also played.\""

      "No, it wasn't nightmare, it really happened. Manchester United lost the chance to salvage their season by winning the Europa League final, as a dreadful 1-0 loss against Tottenham condemned Ruben Amorim's side to a trophyless campaign.",
      "But it's not just this term which has been marred by the defeat in Bilbao. Lifting the trophy at the San Memes would've given United a ticket for the 2025-26 Champions League and earned the club around £100million.",
      "If you believe co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, that kind of cash would've been transformative for the Red Devils' finances. But it's gone Spurs' way, leaving beleaguered boss Amorim to sift through the wreckage and plan for what's set to be a difficult summer and domestic-only season.",
      "Who'll be signed? Who'll be sold? Will Amorim even be in charge? The Portuguese dropped a bombshell post-match and said that he'll walk away if the United board don't think that he's the right man for the job.",
      "Altay Bayindir, thanks for the Arsenal saves but we're going to need stiffer competition for Andre Onana. For the £52m which Onana cost, I'd say United would've been better off spending the money elsewhere and keeping David de Gea.",
      "But this is where we are. In light of Onana wanting to stay, the Red Devils could do with a young goalkeeper who can push him to improve - or take his place. United have an established relationship with Belgian side Royal Antwerp stretching back two decades, so signing their young shot-stopper, Senne Lammens, makes sense, as the 22-year-old shouldn't be too expensive.",
      "There's an argument to be made that United's strongest position when it comes to depth is central defence - at least when they're all fit. Leny Yoro is looking more the part every game, Harry Maguire has enjoyed a resurgence, Matthijs de Ligt is proven at the top level and Lisandro Martinez will come back from injury next season.",
      "But given Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof's looming departures, and even with Ayden Heaven breaking through, it leaves United short. We're working on a budget here, though, so I'd bring in Bayer Leverkusen's Jonathan Tah on a free transfer.",
      "At 29, he's three years younger than Maguire and unlike the rest of United's centre-backs has an impeccable injury record over the last five years. Tah is a leader and before confirming his departure helped Leverkusen follow-up last season's league and cup double with a solid campaign this term.",
      "That's why Bayern Munich and Barcelona are still interested in the Germany international, who's also been linked with Real Madrid. It's a hard sell on paper but United need leaders who can play consistently and Tah fits the bill.",
      "At left-back, Luke Shaw, Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass provide hot competition and the highly-rated Diego Leon is also on his way, so no stress there. On the right, Noussair Mazraoui is a good utility man and I'd think we'd see the best Diogo Dalot if United reverted to a back four.",
      "This is where I'm going bold. Sell Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Yes, I know - I get where they'd statistically be without his goals and assists. But the cold reality is that Fernandes is unlikely to ever be part of a title-winning United side.",
      "The United captain turns 31 in September, so I'd do exactly what the man himself hinted at just minutes after the Europa League final: cash in. Let Fernandes go and rebuild with the kind of fee you could get for him from a Saudi Arabian club.",
      "He'll be missed, of course, and he remains the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. But United need to take the long road back and Fernandes' sale would, in my opinion, have the potential to do more good than his short-term impact.",
      "Following Fernandes out of the door would be Casemiro. Credit to him for bouncing back this season but he showed again in Bilbao that his powers are waning.",
      "Christian Eriksen is almost certain to leave, so we'd be left with a stark lack of experience in midfield. So let's go back to Germany, where Joao Palhinha has spent a mixed first season at Bayern under Vincent Kompany, where he's made only 24 appearances.",
      "The ex-Fulham midfielder felt like a belated Thomas Tuchel signing and he's evidently more suited to the Premier League. Palhinha may've lost confidence and momentum in Bavaria but he'll be a better player for the experience.",
      "And with Bayern pursuing the £126m-rated Florian Wirtz, they'll need all the cash they can get. Back at United, where Mason Mount and youngster Toby Collyer would pick up more minutes in 25-26, you're not going to recoup what you spent on Manuel Ugarte. I wouldn't give up on him yet, though.",
      "The Uruguayan has had a year to get used to the rigours of the Premier League and could strike up a balanced partnership with Kobbie Mainoo, who United must not sell. Not only would the Red Devils be losing a player who I believe is one of the most talented midfielders in Europe, they'd be turning their back on tradition and the United way - selling their soul if one single transfer ever could.",
      "Where do we even start here? Marcus Rashford - sell. Antony - sell. Those decisions seem to have already been made by the hierarchy but in fairness to the pair, they've not been why United have struggled for goals in the second half of the season.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund needs a loan move, somewhere where he can get used to hearing the sound of the net bulge and the crowd roar again. The raw materials are there but right now Joshua Zirkzee, who's also still a rough diamond, should be starting.",
      "This is where I'll go against United's plans. It's not the right time for Liam Delap - even for £30m.",
      "The Red Devils should go for someone more established like Victor Osimhen. Napoli are open to a sale and I'd explore some kind of swap deal with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Osimhen's prolific loan spell with Galatasaray this terms has only boosted his stock, but it doesn't seem like there's concrete interest from Premier League clubs. Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko and Hugo Ekitike are taking up more column inches, so there's an opportunity to nab the Nigerian striker, who could serve as a mentor to United's Chido Obi.",
      "On paper, Matheus Cunha is exactly the type of signing that United should be making. Proven in the Premier League, entering his peak, but questions remain over his attitude and £62.5m isn't cheap.",
      "If United can get the dressing room culture right by signing the likes of Tah, though, the Brazilian's brashness can be harnessed in the best way. His versatility would make United more unpredictable in atack and he can play behind Osimhen or out wide.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is another Premier League-proven target but he's now likely out of United's price range, but Lyon's Rayan Cherki could be a risk worth taking for his rumoured £25m release clause. The 21-year-old playmaker has had a tumultuous rise in France but United witnessed his brilliance in the Europa League.",
      "Given that Cherki is another forward who can play out wide or centrally, he and Cunha could fill the creative void left by Fernandes. It's a big swing but United need to start accepting short-term pain for long-term gain."

      "But the Red Devils couldn’t find the net against a Spurs side who had also endured a tumultuous season to forget. It was the north Londoners who emerged the 1-0 victors and lifted their first trophy since 2008, thanks to a goal that deflected in off Brennan Johnson late in the first half.",
      "A defeated Amorim offered to quit United in his post-match press conference, promising that he would leave without receiving any compensation if the club believed he was no longer good enough to be head coach.",
      "Having been appointed in November, the former Sporting CP boss has only managed to win six out of 26 league games, and has now failed to secure European football for next season by missing out on silverware.",
      "Amorim stated he remains confident in his methods but reiterated that it was down to the club's decision-makers and supporters to decide if he is the right man to continue at the helm.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself, it is not my style,\" Amorim said. \"I cannot do it, it is really hard for me. So I have nothing to show the fans to say I am going to improve because of this, I had these problems, I will not do nothing [sic].",

I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",

But the guys tried everything to win the game. In the future, we will have time to assess everything.\"",
      "Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes echoed his manager's comments by saying he would be willing to leave this summer if club bosses decide to cash in on him. The 30-year-old, who joined in January 2020 and has made close to 300 appearances, has consistently been United's best player in their worst era in recent memory.",
      "But his efforts proved fruitless again on Wednesday. He missed out on the chance to land his biggest trophy as a United player with a second Europa League final defeat, which ensured he will not be playing any European football next season.",
      "The midfielder, who turns 31 in September, has two years remaining on his contract with the option of a further year. He has recently been linked with a stunning move to Al-Hilal in the Saudi Pro League, with such a transfer transforming the financial picture at United.",
      "While Fernandes insists he's happy to stay at Old Trafford and help Amorim in his rebuild, the Portugal international astonishingly revealed he would be willing to leave if club bosses look to sell him.",

I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" he admitted post-game. \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. On the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this. It's very sad. We wanted to win more than anything in this final. It's a very sad day because we've done some very good things in this competition until today.",
      "\"But today was the day that mattered, the most important day of the competition. It was the day we could have been in the history of the Europa League, but it's not like that. And football is cruel, and it's been our turn to lose.\"",

      "Manchester United players returned to the Occidental hotel in Bilbao at 1.30am, ready to pull the duvet up and bury their heads under pillows.",
      "Luke Shaw sounded as though he was on the verge of tears in the mixed zone. Alejandro Garnacho was the most devastated on the pitch.",
      "The players were in their own bubble, as is often the case for defeated finalists. Cristian Romero dared to prick Harry Maguire's and was barracked by the United defender. Maguire had not forgotten Romero goading him after his own goal against Spurs three years ago.",
      "It must be tempting for the penny-pinching Sir Jim Ratcliffe to dispense of Ruben Amorim at no cost after the United head coach's generous post-match offer. Amorim promised that \"if the board and fans feel that I’m not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation\".",
      "In a season of daft decisions at United, Amorim has got in on the act. Shaw in and Garnacho out against Tottenham. Flogging a dead horse in Rasmus Hojlund and like-for-like substitutions. Amorim does not get a free pass in this apocalyptic season.",
      "The United fans stopped singing their Amorim chant in the second half. Nothing quite drains matchgoers of a belief that glory days will return like losing a final to Tottenham. United's end drained quicker than a bathtub.",
      "Amorim is unnervingly honest and he is now practically daring United to dispense of him. Amorim's reputation is not intact though not in tatters, either.",
      "He is not the biggest problem at United. The Glazers are immovable yet they have relinquished control of football operations to Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "Cycling is Brailsford's wheelhouse, not football. He admitted last year he is \"no expert in football\". He went to United and they have not been this bad since relegation in 1974. What on earth is he doing on the football board of Manchester United?",
      "United's worst season in 51 years has to be viewed as an opportunity, a blessing in disguise. Clear the decks. Purge the squad. Send Brailsford on his bike.",
      "Shaw has been at United for 11 years next month. He questioned afterwards if he was good enough for United. He isn't. He is too injury-prone, too unreliable and, given his years at the club, too long in the tooth.",
      "The Sir Matt Busby player of the year statue continues to reside at Bruno Fernandes's home yet he too has practically dared United to cash in on him. It would be too extreme to say United cannot afford to do that. They can.",
      "Fernandes has been a brilliant player and is one to keep, but he is not untouchable. He symbolises the team: something out of nothing, hit-and-hope. Fernandes has been involved in three of United's worst campaigns in living memory.",
      "This has to be the most merciless, decisive and objective summer United have ever presided over. Ratcliffe and his cabal were swayed by emotion last year after winning a final, kept a manager they did not want to keep and invested more than £200m in the summer.",
      "Four of those signings were defensive players. United ended last season on -1 goal difference. It is now -12. The striker they thought they had signed is not a striker.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was serenaded in San Mames and is a borderline cult figure. He is still not good enough for a United squad to get where they need to be.",
      "United are targeting a sixth-place finish next season. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, arrivals from Europe's boot, have to be given the boot. Liam Delap, four days younger, is not the answer just because Jason Wilcox watched him in Manchester City's academy cash-cow.",
      "Two different regimes sign two 20-year-old Denmark internationals 18 months apart, thinking they are good enough to start and they are not. Name the club. It was Hojlund in 2023 and Patrick Dorgu in 2025.",
      "United's revamped recruitment strategy has had an iffy start. Dorgu, a mid-season recruit, has been overpromoted and started against Spurs by default.",
      "Club sources have spoken effusively about Dorgu. They say he is athletic and has fine experience from playing in Serie A. Italy became a dumping ground for English clubs' cast-offs six years ago. Lecce, the team Dorgu left, could be relegated this weekend.",
      "Could United seriously get through a Premier League season with Dorgu and Harry Amass as their left wingers, operating in the role that was Ryan Giggs's in his Nineties pomp? The idealistic answer would be yes but realistically, no.",
      "United have to shift Shaw. He has arguably outstayed his welcome by seven years. Jose Mourinho wanted to jettison him in 2018 and was overruled. United have never truly recovered from that summer where Ed Woodward undermined the United manager. The authority of the manager's position eroded over four more years.",
      "Matheus Cunha would bring guile but can be ill-disciplined. Amorim must have done his due diligence as he sent Marcus Rashford packing, mainly on account of his attitude. Garnacho is still prone to puerile posts on Instagram.",
      "Garnacho is testing United's patience. In case anyone did not follow him on Instagram, he complained about his bench role in the mixed zone on Wednesday evening. A manager can do without that.",
      "Garnacho puts United in an invidious position. Sell him (and possibly Kobbie Mainoo) and back a manager with six wins in 26 Premier League games? Technical director Wilcox has to lean on Amorim and map out a route to success with Garnacho and Mainoo integral to United's future.",
      "United can be blasé about Rashford, Antony and Scott McTominay thriving in a change of scenery. It would be different with the 20-year-olds Garnacho and Mainoo.",
      "Casemiro had a creditable knockout stage but will be redundant next season. His European form has not transmitted to the Premier League and he cannot be a regular at weekends. Manuel Ugarte is no spring chicken at 24 and does not have the coping mechanisms to anchor the United midfield.",
      "Amorim has got to be less pragmatic, too. The 3-4-2-1 formation can be flexible but has hitherto been rigid. It is like-for-like substitutions and no shape-shifting. Amorim may plan ahead with substitutions but the opponents can as well. United do not deviate from a back three.",
      "Pep Guardiola vowed on Tuesday night he would \"quit\" Manchester City if he had a large squad foisted onto him. United need a Guardiola-style streamlined squad for a season in which their League Cup campaign begins in August.",
      "There are players and personalities to get behind: Fernandes, Garnacho, Mainoo, Amad, Maguire, Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui, Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez when he is fit again.",
      "Free midweeks is often an advantage. Newcastle are Champions League-bound again in a season devoid of European football. Leicester City and Chelsea won the title in consecutive years with just a domestic calendar. Liverpool almost did in 2014.",
      "When the Glazers left the Occidental, a fan yelled \"w*****s\" at them. They did not flinch. United are battered, broken and supporters have no faith in the hierarchy after the first 15 months under the inane Ineos rule.",
      "One of the HR Carriages vehicles that ferry Ineos personnel around was at Bilbao Airport on Friday morning. That is hardly penny-pinching."

      "Manchester United's miserable season shows no sign of ending any time soon - after the Reds lost their Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur last night, it emerged that the club has been handed another two-star food hygiene rating after yet more mouse droppings were found at Old Trafford.",
      "The Food Standards Agency has handed the club an improvement notice after inspectors found cleanliness at the club was lacking, with dirty glasses and mouse droppings and concerns about opened food products being kept for too long.",
      "The rating follows an inspection in November which saw the club's rating downgraded from four to two, again following the discovery of mouse droppings. The club's standards of cleanliness have been under scrutiny since its food hygiene rating slashed from a five to a one star after hosting a health and safety event in November 2023 when raw chicken thighs were served to 30 people. Inspectors ruled at the time the food served was 'unfit for human consumption'.",
      "More than 250,000 people dine at the stadium's restaurants each season, with 29 kitchens and catering facilities operated from the site.",
      "A new report by Trafford Council inspectors following a visit on April 16 has heaped more criticism on the club. Mouse droppings were found behind seating in the Manchester Suit, under equipment in Devil's bar, in kiosks in two areas of the the north east quadrant, in a cupboard in the International Suit, under a buffet counter in Number 7 Suit and in the 'goods received' office, according to the report.",
      "The report ordered the club to: \"Ensure areas where droppings are present are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. You should continue to work with your pest control provider to take necessary actions.\"",
      "It also ordered more 'proofing' works to kitchen doors in Number 7 Suit and holes for utilities to Devil's bar as well as the external doors to the 'goods received' office after the inspectors found a strip had broken off.",
      "The report also recommended 'pest proofing' works at utilities holes at Devil's bar where droppings were found and also in the Manchester Suit as a 'large amount of droppings were found' in a room used to store tables close to food areas.",
      "The droppings found in the Manchester Suit were 'not fresh' but the report recommended the use of a vacuum cleaner to remove droppings rather than a brush as old droppings stuck in the hairs could be deposited while cleaning, said the report.",
      "The standard of cleaning in the Ambassador Suit required improvement because inspectors found 'food debris, grease and discarded cling film', said the report. A plate stacker in the suit was 'dirty'.",
      "The standard of cleaning in the Manchester Suit also 'requires improvement' because inspectors found 'dirt build up on surfaces where drinks lines run'. A 'deep clean' of the bars in the suit was required while the inside of fridges at one of the bars was 'dirty' which 'resulted in a build-up of detritus on glasses being stored within it', said the report.",
      "Inspectors also found 'some dirt build-up at low level areas in the walk-in freezer and large blast chiller' in a kitchen while 'dirt build-up' was found on sliding doors to a fridge in kiosks in two areas of the eastern side of the ground, according to the report.",
      "Club staff were unaware a tripped fuse had caused a lack of hot running water at a basin in the 'goods received' office while there was no soap at another basin in the Red Cafe, said the report, which ordered the club to have 'soap available for use at all times' at basins in the ground.",
      "Inspectors also found a container of pesto in a fridge at the Red Cafe had a '1 month' label attached to it even though the manufacturer recommended it should be used within eight days. A container of dressing also had a 1 month label attached even though the manufacturer said the product should be used within four weeks.",
      "The inspectors ordered the club to ensure staff were applying the correct shelf life to products 'as per manufacturer's instructions'.",
      "A Manchester United spokesperson said: \"Manchester United implements a robust pest-control system throughout Old Trafford.",
      "\"Multiple weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served.",
      "\"If incidences of this nature do occur at the stadium, immediate and appropriate action is taken.\""

      "However, Amorim's future did not hinge on the outcome of the final in Bilbao, with the United power brokers keen not to repeat their mistake of last season when they retained Erik ten Hag after the unexpected FA Cup final triumph against Manchester City.",
      "United had intended to sack Ten Hag before United beat City at Wembley but did a U-turn amid the feel-good factor of a 13th FA Cup victory. Ten Hag was dismissed in October after nine league fixtures.",
      "Since Amorim replaced Ten Hag as permanent manager in November, United have won six of their 26 Premier League games and sunk to 16th in the table. They could finish the season in 17th if they lose to Aston Villa and Tottenham avoid defeat to Brighton on Sunday.",
      "The loss to Spurs means this is only the second season that United have failed to qualify for a European competition in 35 years and it is officially their worst campaign since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself, is not my style,\" Amorim said at his post-match press conference. \"I cannot do it, is really hard for me. So I have nothing to show to the fans to say I am going to improve because of this, I had these problems, I will not do nothing.",
      "\"In this moment, it’s a little bit of faith. So let’s see. Like I said before, coming here before in the flash, I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I’m not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation.",
      "\"But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",

      "With defeat in Bilbao meaning United now miss out on Champions League revenues, United will seek to raise funds elsewhere to boost Amorim's transfer kitty and that could make any huge offer for Fernandes a tempting one.",

      "Fernandes' contract with United runs until June 2027, and the club also has the option to extend it for another year. However, following the defeat in Bilbao, the 30-year-old conceded that he would understand if United decided to sell him – a scenario that has now become a real possibility.",

      "The decision from Whiteside and his wife, Dee, not to renew their season tickets comes a year after they were forced to relocate their seats at Old Trafford to make way for executive seating.",
      "Writing on X, Dee Whiteside wrote: \"So, I’ve waited for a while to write this. It is with unbelievable sadness, that after more than 28 years of having season tickets at Old Trafford, @NormanWhiteside and I are not renewing next year.",
      "\"Having been forcibly relocated last season, “red carded” for not attending enough games, unable to give my “paid for” seat to my children… enough is enough.",
      "\"And to cap it all, we’ve seen it all, we’ve won the lot, we’re Man United and we’re never gonna stop… except for so many seasons now, my match-going loyalty to my club has ended so sadly.",
      "\"I’ll still be at games, I’m MUFC until I die, and I’ve seen worse times than now, but I’m not sure I’ve seen players less interested in pulling on our shirt for very many years. Times must change.\"",
      "Whiteside and his wife are platinum season ticket holders, which means they have held their tickets at Old Trafford for over 25 years, but they have felt compelled to walk away from United.",
      "A spokesperson for United said at the time: “We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations.",
      "\"There are various reasons why this happens, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders — in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.”",
      "Whiteside became the youngest player to score in both FA Cup and League Cup finals during his time in Manchester. The Northern Irishman also became the youngest to play in a World Cup, breaking Pele's record when representing his nation aged just 17 years and 40 days.",
      "Whiteside's career ended at the age of 26 due to injury, but he is still remembered fondly by fans for his contribution and his match-winning goal against Everton in the 1985 FA Cup final."

      "Alejandro Garnacho has dropped a huge hint over a potential transfer away from Manchester United following Wednesday night's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "United suffered a disappointing 1-0 loss to Spurs in Bilbao to confirm their worst-ever season in 51 years. Brennan Johnson's scrappy first-half goal was the difference to bring Champions League football to north London.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men came close to equalising through Luke Shaw's stoppage time header in what was a frustrating evening in Spain.",
      "Garnacho, who was named on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames, came on the final 20 minutes on the left wing looking to cause damage. However, he was unable to break down Spurs' stubborn defence.",
      "The winger had started 10 of United's previous 14 Europa League fixtures but Mason Mount was selected ahead of him alongside Amad behind the striker.",
      "After Garnacho's brother, Roberto, caused a stir with his post on social media, the United winger spoke to some members of the media in the mixed zone as a visibly frustrated figure.",
      "Speaking to ESPN Argentina, he said: “I played every round to help the team reach the final, and today I only got 20 minutes… I don’t know.",
      "\"I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.” He added: \"This season was s***, losing the final and not beating anyone in the league.”",
      "Garnacho is one of the players at Old Trafford who could now be sold in the summer transfer window to raise funds.",
      "The Argentina international attracted interest from Chelsea and Napoli in January and his situation is expected to be monitored during the summer."

      "Manchester United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham further proves that the club is in dire need of reinforcements.",
      "The defeat to Spurs marks only the second time in 35 years that United have failed to qualify for European competition and officially confirms their worst season since relegation in 1974.",
      "However, those in charge won’t have to wait much longer to get their business underway, with the summer transfer window set to open on June 1. And Ruben Amorim has already confirmed the club's stance on the market.",
      "\"We have two plans even for the market,\" Amorim confirmed. \"We need to understand that is tough for a club like us not to be in the Champions League. But we have to use the other side. We have more time to work during the week on the Premier League and that will be our focus.\"",
      "The club is reportedly aware of the conditions required to trigger the clause. However, there has been no 'direct contact' between the clubs so far, though those formalities are expected to happen once the season ends.",
      "Other clubs are also interested in Cunha, but he is thought to prefer a move to United.",
      "MEN Sport says: This appears to be the only positive piece of transfer news at the moment. Missing out on Champions League football could have serious consequences for the club when it comes to attracting new players.",
      "The Brazilian’s reported willingness to join the Reds despite the lack of European football is encouraging, and securing a player like Cunha would strengthen their squad for next season. However, it’s clear they’ll need more than just Cunha to significantly improve Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "TalkSPORT have provided an update on Liam Delap, with Newcastle United said to hold talks with Ipswich Town's in-demand striker 'this week.'",
      "In addition to United and Chelsea, Newcastle are thought to be one of the clubs who have shown interest in triggering the 22-year-old's £30million release clause. Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano says the striker is still 'exploring his options' after holding talks with Chelsea and United.",
      "In his Caught Offside column, Romano wrote: \"There is genuine interest from two very important clubs – Chelsea and Manchester United. Both clubs have several targets on their shortlists between them, but for sure the interest in Delap is concrete and genuine. My understanding is that Delap has spoken to Chelsea and to Manchester United, and now it’s time for him to explore all the options possible.",
      "\"From what I’m hearing there is also interest from clubs in the Bundesliga – important clubs from Germany would be ready to hold talks with the player and offer him an important contract. Still, the player’s priority is very clear – to stay in the Premier League, to stay in England.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: This could be a major blow for United, especially after missing out on Champions League football next season. Clubs like Chelsea and Newcastle are likely to be able to offer that to Delap, should he choose to join one of them. While United's chiefs appear to have beaten off competition for Cunha’s signature, this deal is could be more complicated.",
      "Arsenal appear to be in pole position to secure Viktor Gyokeres' signature - especially after their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League. The 1-0 loss meant that United missed out on a lucrative return to the Champions League next season.",
      "To fund further spending, they'll need to offload some high-profile players, with Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho potentially on their way out. Meanwhile, Gyökeres is eager to test himself at the highest level, aiming to compete in the Champions League and fight for major trophies next season.",
      "Speaking on Portuguese television channel Sic Noticias, Gyokeres was asked what the future holds and said: \"Hopefully you can expect I keep improving and score goals.\"",
      "When probed further about what this summer holds, the striker made no guarantees to Sporting: \"We'll see. It's the future. Football is like that, you never know what's going to happen. As we saw this season, you never know what's going to happen. And it's the same thing now. We'll see what the future holds.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: Unfortunately, missing out on a Champions League spot could see Gyokeres head to north London instead. This highlights the growing contrast between the two clubs - Arsenal are competing for titles every season, while United have fallen short, enduring their worst league campaign since the 1973/74 season.",
      "At present, United simply can't compete with Arsenal in terms of consistency, squad quality, and Champions League football - all of which give the Gunners a clear edge in attracting top talent."

      "\"You're the captain, come on!\" the England international appeared to say, who clearly felt Romero was making a meal of the incident, later getting up and continuing to play on.",
      "The pair then exchanged verbals in the second-half, but it was Spurs who were in the driving seat thanks to Brennan Johnson's first-half striker and that would prove the difference at full-time.",

      "\"It's been a disappointing season, but of course football is about memories, it's about creating memories, it's about winning trophies and we have a great opportunity to win a trophy. For our fans, it's what they deserve, so that's the most important thing.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag has turned down the chance to return to Ajax, with the former Manchester United manager now edging closer to a sensational return to the dugout with 2023/24 Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Leverkusen have made “progress” in talks with Ten Hag, who has “given his total availability” following direct contact earlier this week. That shift in momentum comes as Ajax admit defeat in their bid to bring their former manager back to Amsterdam.",

      "Ten Hag arrived at Man Utd with a big reputation after his success with Ajax, but left the club in October 2024, having failed to meet expectations.",
      "Despite delivering silverware in the shape of the FA Cup and EFL Cup, his tenure was marred by inconsistency, a fractured dressing room, and a failure to establish any real identity or progress on the pitch.",
      "Needless to say, things haven’t improved much, as United went from eighth under his watch to just above the relegation zone under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Even with major investment and full control over recruitment, Ten Hag’s Utd often looked rudderless. His high-pressing system never quite materialised, senior players regressed, and a long list of injuries exposed the lack of tactical flexibility in his setup.",

      "This is what rock-bottom looks like, is it?",
      "Manchester United fans, with a view skewed by years of Sir Alex Ferguson-led glory, assumed many, many times in the dozen years since that the nadir had been reached. Nope. Come 6pm on Sunday while likely looking up from 17th in the Premier League, all that is left beneath is the Championship.",
      "Until now, the thought of Manchester United being relegated has been restricted to the wet dreams of ABUs. Logic says the club is simply too big to fail so spectacularly. But this is not the United of old. F*** knows what this United is.",
      "Now, barely a night’s sleep after losing the Europa League final, it is too much to explore in depth all the issues that make the Red Devils the undisputed banter champions of the world. Too much. Too sad.",
      "In short: United are a failed state. Once the richest of world superpowers, now unashamedly penny-pinching and staff-shedding in an attempt to live within its means, while those most culpable for their decline – players, executives, owners – trouser their grotesque salaries and dividends.",
      "The Glazers don’t give a f***. They milk their ailing cash cow from behind the safety of an INEOS-shaped shield, fronted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe carrying the look of billionaire regretting his life choices. At his stage of life, he doesn’t need this sh*t.",
      "And that’s precisely what the team have served up on a bi-weekly basis. At least, unlike Ratcliffe, the players and coaching staff are only tied to the boulder dragging them to the ocean floor for as long their contracts dictate. Or until someone, anyone, offers to pay actual money for them.",
      "There is perhaps one player, Bruno Fernandes, whose departure would be mourned by a majority of supporters. For many of his team-mates, there would be long queues of fans willing to piggy-back them to their next destination.",
      "It is too simple to say they don’t care. Most do, though predominantly with self-preservation in mind. Being a United player in recent years has been a cushy gig. Unlike other clubs, the personal rewards – the highest salaries and biggest profiles – were guaranteed regardless of the team’s fortunes. It is why Old Trafford remained an attractive destination, even while it was crumbling, literally and metaphorically.",
      "Not now. Would you advise any player to join this circus? Instinctively, the motives and sanity of anyone signing for United this summer will be questioned. Any top talent with a modicum of sense and palatable alternatives would drop their shoulder on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Poor Ruben. He did not want to join United mid-season and, in hindsight, he should have stuck to his guns. It highlights that as recently as six months ago, United still had something like the pull of old to make him doubt his instincts. Now, his first summer coincides with the first in generations when the club has so little to advertise.",
      "If Amorim was a pragmatist, he would consider resigning. He has offered to leave without compensation if the board and fans feel he should. Though he has failed to deliver anything like the improvement that was expected when he replaced Erik ten Hag, or even just a continuation of that dross, he probably still has an acceptable approval rating among fans. Barely.",
      "But if he looks at the task now before him, are his targets achievable? Just a fortnight ago, it was said that Amorim had been set the goal of a top-six finish next season. Would he honestly back himself to get what he admits is the ‘worst-ever Manchester United team’ up at least 11 places amid the chaos likely to ensue in the coming months?",
      "If so, crack on. If not, he’s still new enough in the job to deny ownership of the sh*tshow around him and leave with his reputation bruised rather than battered, beaten and left for dead in a gutter.",
      "If you ask supporters, most would probably prefer to avoid another managerial change. Who else is there? Amorim is a likeable fella and many fans appreciate his honesty even if outsiders don’t. But suspicion grows that he doesn’t help himself.",
      "He was appointed as one of Europe’s brightest young coaches with an admirable, steadfast belief in his principles and system. For as long as he’s in charge, United will be playing 3-4-2-f***ing-1.",
      "Which, of course, makes them hilariously easy to play against, especially while he has a squad wholly unsuited to it. It is lost on precisely nobody that a must-win final between two coaches who refuse to adapt was won by the one who eventually did.",
      "Amorim admitted in the wake of the Europa League final defeat that without tangible evidence of improvement, he is asking for ‘a little bit of faith’. Blind faith, that, when the manager has neither the means to play his way or the will to even consider the possibility of another.",
      "In the absence of anything else to cling to, Amorim will probably get what he’s asked for. Maybe he’ll repay that faith. But amid the post-Bilbao gloom, after a 21st defeat of the season, it is entirely conceivable that United have depths yet to plumb.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has refused to rule out the prospect of Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final.",

When Ten Hag had to adapt to the players available in the meantime, he was derided for a lack of discernible style (while doing better). Amorim’s tactic is ALL about counter-attack at pace, yet we simply don’t see this in action at all. When we launched long balls to Fellaini, Weghorst and Scotty, the manager was mocked. But it’s ok for Amorim to do it less effectively with Maguire?",

We need that youthful running and fearlessness, we need that hunger, we need players who are about the team not themselves, we need players from the academy and area. And as a result of this “performance”, we now can’t realistically afford to keep these big-wage players. It’s time to act like we were actually relegated, clear the deadwood, and rebuild properly, whether we keep Amorim or not.",
      "Critically, the club needs to be shot of players who regularly get exposed in the biggest games. Obviously, I’m thinking Maguire in particular there who once again exposed, Shaw (powers definitely now very waned) as he has done on repeat down the years. I’m also thinking one-trick Bruno who once again couldn’t pass in between the cracks and just pinged balls out wide. I’ll say it again: Bruno has personally *missed* as many big chances as he has created. Too often, he was more interested in moaning at his team-mates than being available for the pass.",
      "Back to the main villain here though, forget the refusal to make substitutions in a timely manner – poor Amad was run out by the 60th minute, having been kicked all game – the introduction of Mainoo with 2 minutes of regular time left was a f***ing insult. This guy has the perfect skill set for exactly this kind of game where space is tight, but no… seems Ineos want to get him to accept being sold, so puppy dog Amorim won’t play him.",

ETH got rid of loads and only brought in a small number of bodies – at great expense – almost all of whom haven’t worked out.

Not because we lost in a final to the 17th best team in England but because if you haven’t notice United can’t actually beat any of the top 16 teams in England not called Manchester United. Not only that but we have a team that is seemingly full of players – with few exceptions – that are physically incapable of performing in their designated league.",
      "United play at half pace compared to the good English teams (including Spurs). I am worried this is down to both the manager AND the players. If it’s one or the other I can work with it and have some patience but I think it might be both. This would mean yet another full reset is needed. After every other reset that has followed a managerial appointment in the last 13 years and counting.",
      "If we err on the side of optimism and say Amorim is just hampered by his players (we are at least starting to dominate possession even if we aren’t doing anything with it) then let’s look at the squad (again, because everyone wants another United deep dive).",
      "Onana – not good enough. In his prime.\nBayindir – not good enough. In his prime.\nHeaton – old",
      "Dorgu – has the physicality and possibly some skill but is still inexperienced\nShaw – fragile, cannot be trusted to play every week, hasn’t performed consistently for United in two years. Also turns 30 in July.\nDalot – availability is his biggest asset. Not great going forward. In his prime\nMazraoui – has been surprisingly available, good defender, not great going forward. In his prime\nMaguire – old, plodding, not reliable in any sense, annoyingly stupid occasionally and prone to mistakes. Good for ten minutes in each game as a centre forward though\nYoro – inexperienced but definitely going to be a great player if he avoids injuries\nDe Ligt – a younger Maguire. In his prime.\nMartinez – injury prone, short. But a fan favourite and we love him. In his prime.\nLindelof – old and never good enough (wasted a minute for spurs by complaining about time added on\nHeaven – young but looks like he has potential and physicality\nAmass – looks a baller but he’s tiny! Young and inexperienced\nFredricson – has done ok when he’s played. Young and inexperienced\nMalacia – probably not good enough but also lacking physicality, especially after his injury. Hasn’t played the full 90 mins on loan for PSV since March. In his prime.\nJonny Evans – too old and injured",
      "Bruno – heart and would of the team. Brilliant but frustrating. Getting on a bit.\nUgarte – should be approaching his prime but can’t get in the side against Spurs in a European final. Does he lack the pace and passing ability for the Premier League?\nEriksen – slow, old, past it\nCasemiro – see Eriksen\nMainoo – huge potential but easy to get past. Lack of physicality.\nToby Collyer – looks ok when fit. Tenacious if limited passing ability (from what we’ve seen).\nDan Gore – tiny but tenacious. Young and massively inexperienced\nMount – theoretically a proper Premier League player in his prime. Practically an unknown entity due to injuries.",
      "Hojlund – still young, lacking confidence. Probably also lacking skill, strength and intelligence. Has the size and speed (and possibly the ability) to trouble defences acrosss the world but hasn’t figured out how to use it. Quite possibly never will under the spotlight at United.\nMarcus Rashford – skillful, fast, strong when he wants to be, in his prime. Performs only in fits and starts and doesn’t want to be at United (don’t necessarily blame him for the latter). Still only 27.\nZirkzee – seems quite decent. Has the physicality and the skill to play in the Oremier league, not necessarily the speed. Can. Not. Shoot. Still young(ish)\nAmad – young, skillful, great at pressing but lacks physicality when on the ball and entering the box. Has scored seven league goals this year but three were against Southampton.\nGarnacho – Still young. Much like Amad seems a little lightweight but doesnt necessarily work as hard. Slight better quality with his shooting though. Exciting player to watch.\nAntony – should be in his prime. Rubbish for United after an ok first season. Lighting up the Conference League for Betis. Not a Premier League quality forward though could be repurposed as a wing back?\nEthan Wheatley – Young, massively inexperienced. No idea if he has the talent required at the top level.\nChido Obi – lots of hype. Tall but needs to fill out. Only 17. Could be a good player, could disappear.\nSancho – should be in his prime. Not apparently quick enough or physical enough for the Premier League. Seems to have some other baggage.",
      "Right so from that list of 34 players we have 14 players that are still young and unproven in the Premier League. 7 players are passsed it (or never were it), including Luke Shaw who has been a walking injury for far too long. That leaves 13 who are in their prime (or should be) but that includes two goalkeepers who are definitely not performing at the required level, at least three players who have big question marks over their injury records and at least three who are currently plying their trade elsewhere because they want to leave the club. Malacia is a combination of all three (except the goalkeeper part). This leaves us with four competent outfield players in their prime who have no question marks over their quality* or availability: Dalot, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte. And the jury is probably out on Ugarte.",
      "I wouldn’t be totally upset if United shed 13 players this summer. But if we shed the ones I’m thinking about, we’d be down to a squad of 21, 14 of which would fit in that young and inexperienced bracket. I think this is potentially disastrous. Not for the first time in its history United are over reliant on young players to perform. Whilst there is bags of potential there, the Premier League is less forgiving than at any time in the past and most of those players are lacking the physicality or composure to thrive in it.",
      "Equally, United are now incentivised to sell the best of those players before selling the 13 I mentioned. In doing so, the soul of the club will be damaged as a result, even if you don’t think Garnacho or Mainoo are good enough.",
      "All this is to say that United are now more than open heart surgery away from competing in the Premier League. Fans will be expecting a bounce back into Europe next year. Some will even fancy a Champions League spot or a title push. The reality is that the first goal – for the first time in the Premier League era – will be to get to 40 points. Based on the current squad, anything else will be a bonus.",
      "Perhaps we’ll be able to say a lot of those young players have come of age next year and everyone will stop being injured and we’re no longer looking at a squad containing 4 players in their prime. If we do so then we’ve had a better season than this one by a long stretch. But then we could also be relegated for the first time in 50+ years.\nAshmundo (quietly pleased for Ange, mate)",
      "*in terms of being good enough to play in the league, not win it. By the latter measure we are very fucked indeed.",
      "It’s who real fans are, mate\nLast night the football wasn’t great, but as the fans of either team could tell you, on such an occasion the only thing that matters is the result. Shortly after the final whistle two of my three sons drove down to Tottenham just to be part of the celebration. Since I started taking the boys to Spurs in the early nineties, the celebrations have been fairly thin.",

      "The volume of messages demeaning the Spurs achievement with tired old cliches “tallest dwarf”, “bald men and combs” are so typical of the online football universe, especially irritating from fans of clubs not involved. Many of whom who are probably like my lads school friends, die hard fans of clubs in cities they haven’t even visited. Just let the fans of either team celebrate/vent as appropriate. Let people enjoy the moment, not everything has to be a d*ck measuring contest. There is a shortage of joy in the world, so just back off and let fans enjoy themselves.",
      "So far this year I have been genuinely happy for Newcastle and Palace, whilst I know a couple of Geordies I know no Palace fans at all, but could appreciate the joy of both sets of fans at winning, after some lean years.",
      "I will join my lads to see the parade on Friday, and be back in my usual seat on Sunday. As grumpily as ever I will fork out the cost of my season ticket renewal at the latest possible moment.",
      "As I finished my last beer last night, I browsed your late night mailbox, and found myself totally overwhelmed. In amongst all the garbage mentioned above, there was a brief note from Garey Vance MUFC. Despite my not having written to this site in quite a long time, he name checked me, telling me to enjoy the celebrations.",

      "It was also fantastic to see their fans and players celebrating and enjoying it so much. I watched the game with a lifelong Spurs fan, and there was a small group of other Spurs fans in the United dominated pub. It was great to see how delighted they were. Modern football has increasingly found a smaller and smaller pool of teams hoovering up all the pots. This season has been different and all the better for it. Palace winning the FA cup, Spurs winning last night. Even as a Liverpool fan I was able to enjoy the celebrations as Newcastle broke their trophy curse.",

      "The flashbacks just rubbed salt into the open wounds, particularly as they illustrated just how far Manchester United had fallen.

At which point my 11 meg of broadband couldn’t take it anymore and snapped for an hour. I don’t expect I missed anything.",

Whose decision was it to do the five-hour show? And who do they answer to? I wonder what creative reason they invented to justify it? I watch football every day of every week and it was even too much for me and too low in quality.",

      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho has opened the door to a summer exit after being dropped by Ruben Amorim for the Europa League final having “played every round” to get them there.",
      "Brennan Johnson scored the only goal of the game at the San Mames to end Spurs’ 17-year wait for a trophy and secure Ange Postecoglou’s side a spot in the Champions League next season.",
      "Johnson’s darting run into the six-yard box caught Luke Shaw on his heels at the end of the first half as he attempted to divert Pape Matar Sarr’s cross in, with the ball rebounding off Shaw and past Andre Onana.",
      "Defeat in the final confirmed United’s worst season in 51 years, with the run to the Europa League final putting gloss on a miserable domestic campaign which has seen the Red Devils win just six of 26 league games since Amorim took charge in November.",
      "Amorim made the shock decision to start Mason Mount over Garnacho despite the Argentinian starting every knockout game to get them to the final and largely impressing in those victories.",
      "“Tottenham put full-backs and midfielders inside to overload the space. To have possession and a right foot in that position is important.”",
      "MORE ON TOTTENHAM VICTORY OVER MAN UTD ON F365\n👉 Ten Europa League final players who should be axed in Man Utd, Spurs rebuilds\n👉  Bruno Fernandes makes bombshell exit call as Man Utd captain claims Amorim sack ‘easy’ decision\n👉 Rio Ferdinand blames £25m Man Utd star for Europa League final defeat to Tottenham",
      "Rio Ferdinand hit out at Amorim over the decision after the game despite appearing to be fully in favour ahead of kick-off, and Garnacho wasn’t happy having come on in the 71st minute.",
      "Speaking to Argentine media after the Europa League final, Garnacho said: “It’s tough for everyone. This season has been sh*t. Losing the final now and not beating anyone in the league.",
      "“There were a lot of things missing – when you don’t score goals, you always need more at the end. I played every round until we reached the final, I helped the team, and to play twenty minutes today… I don’t know.”",
      "When asked about his future, Garnacho replied: “The game has an impact, but the season itself, the club’s situation… I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”",
      "Roberto Garnacho was far from impressed with Amorim’s decision, claiming his brother had been ‘thrown under a bus’ on social media.",
      "He posted on Instagram: ‘Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from 2 goals last 2 finals, just to be on the pitch 19 mins and get thrown under the bus, wowe hajjahhahaha.’",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has refused to rule out the prospect of Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final.",
      "Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan has slammed one Manchester United star, deeming him a “little weakling” after the Europa League final.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has commented on how Manchester United will be impacted by their Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Man Utd have reignited their interest in a £34m Serie A star to replace Alejandro Garnacho, who ‘wants to leave’ after the Europa League final defeat.",
      "Things could get even worse for a failed state of a football club with a manager without the means to play his way or the willingness to change…",
      "Man Utd lost to Spurs and you might have thought that was interesting enough without inventing BRUTAL digs and ‘sack decisions’."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 15 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.6\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton, and made just one excellent stop v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.2% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, leaving him level with David Raya for the Golden Gloves award.",
      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.6\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final.",
      "",
      "5) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have faced the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "6) Alisson (Liverpool): +2.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more. Remarkably, he made nine saves v Brighton as a sloppy Liverpool lost 3-2.",
      "",
      "7) Kepa (Bournemouth): +2.0\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",
      "",
      "8) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "9) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "11) David Raya (Arsenal): +1.3\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Gloves.",
      "",
      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "13) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.2\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "14) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.1\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it matters have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -1.8\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton.",
      "",
      "17) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -2.6\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -3.4\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded fewer goals than Fulham this season.",
      "",
      "19) Jose Sa (Wolves): -4.1\nSaved a penalty v Leicester City to keep his seventh clean sheet of the season.",
      "",
      "20) Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): -5.6\nKept a first clean sheet since February in their win over Wolves but it has still been a very shaky season for the Dutchman.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "Emiliano Martinez has established himself as one of the world’s best. The bravado that made him so might not work at Man Utd if he replaces Andre Onana…",

      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "",
      "1) If history truly is written by the victors, the history of the Tottenham has been a second-hand account for too long.",
      "In the words of the scorer of the goal which salvaged from a wreckage of a season the club’s first silverware in 17 years: “We get battered for not winning a trophy, so we had to get the first one in a while today.”",
      "It didn’t feel particularly Spursy to take the lead in such a ridiculously critical final and defend it so diligently. It seemed like the conclusive appointment for Dr. Tottenham to treat an unimaginably ill patient back to miraculous health through unthinkable incompetence. The world was waiting for a moment of ultimate schadenfreude which never came.",
      "The team which finished third in a two-horse race. The Put The Pressure On merchants. The Europa League winners. Warra trophy indeed. The end-of-season DVD might be entirely unwatchable for the first few chapters but the final scenes were more euphoric than anyone dared to dream.",
      "",
      "2) It is ludicrous that from the embers of what should have been one manager’s stunning mic drop, another has delivered perhaps the single most vindicating middle finger in recorded history.",
      "“If they don’t want me, then I go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I do,” said Erik ten Hag after inspiring Manchester United to a victory at Wembley which paved this absurd path to the Europa League final almost exactly a year later.",
      "That directly influenced Manchester United to bottle the decision to sack the manager, the ramifications for which have been severe, obvious and not yet fully realised; it remains to be seen whether this grants Ange Postecoglou the time and patience he believes is needed “to build a team that can be successful for four, five years”.",
      "“I don’t feel I’ve completed the job here,” he added. And there is a substantial difference between Manchester United collecting trophies under different coaches even in these directionless post-Ferguson years, and Spurs ending a drought which has crippled them for almost two decades. The manager who achieved that was always going to be hailed as an icon and a legend. It is almost impossible to remove emotion from that equation and until the final whistle blew in Bilbao it was difficult to compute or appreciate how much this would change the mood, the complexion, everything.",
      "This muddies the decision over Postecoglou’s future considerably and there honestly doesn’t feel like a clear answer exists any more in the same way it absolutely did at Old Trafford 12 months ago. Spurs would be completely forgiven for basing the call on one game in a way Manchester United never should have. As far as counter-arguments to finishing 17th go, few can ever be as compelling.",
      "",
      "3) Postecoglou will, either way, always have his “I always win things in my second year” conversation-ender. It has a slightly more positive ring to it than Jose Mourinho’s third-season syndrome, and thankfully overshadowed most of the talk about what Spurs should do next.",
      "The 59-year-old deserved his moment away from the idle speculation which has followed and taunted him for months. There are legitimate criticisms to be levied over a great many aspects of this Spurs season, and questions worth asking as to whether this suddenly eradicates those problems heading into next season, but far too much commentary has crossed over into something more personal against Postecoglou, whose infrequent tirades have been understandable.",
      "This is a career-defining success more than 40 years in the making. He is the first coach from outside of Europe or Argentina to ever win a European trophy, and it is almost impossible to fathom the farcical amount of barriers he has faced from the beginning of his journey to this incredible peak.",
      "“The strategy was to bring in a trophy manager and we did it twice. You have to learn from the mistakes,” said Daniel Levy in September 2023. Spurs broke Mourinho and Antonio Conte, but not Postecoglou.",
      "",
      "4) A couple of months after that revealing statement from Levy came the quote which, until now, had encapsulated Postecoglou’s Spurs reign.",
      "“It’s just who we are, mate. It’s just who we are. It’s who we’re gonna be for as long as I’m here.”",
      "Premier League leaders Spurs, down to nine men after less than an hour, had continued to deploy a high line, kept attacking Chelsea whenever possible and fell on their swords in an eventual 4-1 defeat. It was a stirring performance and message but one which summed up a naive stubbornness they could not possibly use as solid foundations upon which to build.",
      "It has not been especially relevant for some time, particularly in this tournament. Spurs have kept as many clean sheets in the Europa League this season as they have in the Premier League despite playing 23 more games in the latter, having shown a willingness to compromise and evolve.",
      "This was a continuation of the quarter and semi-final second legs: a sacrifice of principles to focus on resolute, organised and compact defending to consolidate a position of strength. It might have felt a little early for some when Postecoglou substituted his goalscorer to form a five-man backline in the 79th minute but it paid off handsomely.",
      "Spurs had the fewest shots, possession share and completed passes of any major European finalist on record. And they won. It’s just who they are now, mate.",
      "",
      "5) That makes for an uncomfortable contrast with Ruben Amorim, who might well have overseen his worst Manchester United game at the least opportune time.",
      "An ineffective set-up was compounded by a lethargic approach and a bizarre reluctance to change anything which played into Tottenham’s hands. The first substitutions came about 20 minutes too late and it is remarkably damning that the one concession Amorim seems willing to consider at the expense of his system is to stick Harry Maguire up front for the final five minutes and get it into the mixer.",
      "That worked against Porto and Lyon in this competition and Leicester in the Carabao, but even at their worst Spurs were fully prepared for the best Manchester United had to throw at them.",
      "Even after the game Amorim said he “will not change” how he operates and if that remains his stance after abdicating their Premier League responsibilities for six months in the name of a final they didn’t bother to show up for, it is worth wondering whether Manchester United should simply cut their losses again.",
      "It seems unlikely but when the £21.4m it cost to install Amorim is added to the £4.1m paid to hire and fire Dan Ashworth, the millions lost in prize money and the spiralling expenses required to rebuild this mess in the transfer window, it is increasingly difficult to envisage the manager surviving any vaguely efficient end-of-season review without the hierarchy contorting itself to justify their apparent foolishness.",
      "Of course, this is Sunk-Cost Fallacy Football Club we are talking about here, and they will plough on for at least a few more months after things become clearly untenable.",
      "",
      "6) It might be simplistic but the differences in how these two teams approached the final in the build-up alone were stark.",
      "The Manchester United pre-match press conference featured Amorim, Maguire and Bruno Fernandes all cracking jokes, while the Spurs equivalent was headlined by Postecoglou admonishing a journalist for suggesting he could be labelled a “clown”.",
      "The Australian has defended his players to a fault, with Amorim desperate to publicly immolate both himself and his squad.",
      "He also said winning the Europa League “will not change anything in our problems” and openly wondered whether not qualifying for the Champions League would be more beneficial in the long run; Postecoglou showed no shame in underlining how it meant everything to him, the players and the club itself to win it and “change things”, from their trajectory to how they are perceived.",
      "Even the starting line-ups were diametrically opposed. Spurs made ten changes with Pape Matar Sarr the only survivor, and Manchester United made one with Victor Lindelof the sole casualty. The former favoured rest while the latter opted for rhythm, but long before a ball was kicked it was resoundingly apparent who this meant more to. The bus parade beat the BBQ.",
      "",
      "7) The last disparity came just before kick-off. The Manchester United starting line-up gathered in a huddle near the centre circle, oblivious to the Spurs players who walked past them to applaud and appreciate the fans rocking in the end they would be attacking.",
      "They formed their congregation in front of that riotous travelling support in a show of unity between the players and the fans. It was a small but meaningful gesture which had no bearing on the result but it summed up the fractious nature of Manchester United in 2025 that they didn’t think to do the same.",
      "",
      "8) The first 20 minutes or so were characterised by high pressing, manic defending and nervous goalkeeping from both sides.",
      "The plan for Manchester United seemed entirely contingent on getting the ball to Amad; with Spurs it was a little less obvious beyond testing Andre Onana with quick deliveries into the box.",
      "Postecoglou’s side had 13 crosses to Manchester United’s 12 in the first half. In the second half it was zero to 20 as Spurs turned their best form of attack into an obdurate defence. Cristian Romero reached such a flow state that he started a war with Maguire just to keep himself busy.",
      "",
      "9) On that note, here is a passable impression of Sean Dyche on co-commentary a minute before Crystal Palace scored in the FA Cup final:",
      "‘Against a Man United side who don’t generally require a great deal of breaking down and offer frequent gifts, the presence of Spurs’ first-choice backline may be of far greater significance than any absences further forward.",
      "‘Most obviously, Man United’s back three is vulnerable specifically to wide players ghosting in at the far post to score from crosses. They have conceded almost the exact same goal five times in their last three Premier League games – twice against West Ham, twice against Brentford and against Chelsea.",
      "‘It is a goal Spurs score frequently, with Brennan Johnson’s Temu Raheem Sterling act a genuine potential gamebreaker here.’",
      "What a shame it was a front-post Johnson ghosting which ultimately decided the game. Tickers, you fraud.",
      "",
      "10) But what a worthy goalscorer, even if UEFA’s insistence that Luke Shaw did not administer the final touch feels slightly hollow.",
      "It was Johnson’s goal in spirit either way, his run which caused communicative ripples in the opposition defence, his presence which proved such a nuisance as to render Manchester United’s eight-to-three numerical advantage in the box from Sarr’s cross wholly moot.",
      "For a player who was compelled to deactivate his social media accounts due to fan abuse in September, and who felt uneasy enough in his relationship with those supporters not to celebrate the goals he scored soon after, it was a stunning moment.",
      "Johnson’s movements off the ball might genuinely be among the best in the Premier League and this was further reward for his work. If Nottingham Forest qualify for the Champions League this weekend there might finally be competition for Dan Burn in the What A Week For stakes.",
      "",
      "11) The ball came off Shaw but there were arguably three teammates more culpable for the goal. The cross could even have been cut out at source really but a clever Rodrigo Bentancur run did stretch the play well.",
      "Maguire seemed to choose not to get a touch when he could have cleared it. Onana’s reaction time was pitiful and perhaps even specifically designed to try and make the save which never came look better. But Patrick Dorgu can shoulder most of the blame.",
      "Shaw, monitoring Dominic Solanke, pointed to Johnson on multiple occasions to prompt his teammate to mark the Welshman more tightly. Dorgu was already a step or two behind when the ball came in, and Shaw only realised when Johnson emerged over his shoulder. The way it was bundled into the net was unfortunate from Manchester United’s standpoint, but the amateurishness of what came before made it possible.",
      "A few minutes earlier in the first half, a cross reached Dorgu at the back post with no Spurs player in the vicinity, but he chested the ball out for a corner to Onana’s frustration. It is unknown whether he received the call from a teammate to take his time or simply ignored it, but for a similar situation to unfold soon after is inept at this level.",
      "",
      "12) From that point Spurs were largely content to defend, as was their right. The unheralded key to success on that front was how they consistently broke up the play.",
      "They committed 22 fouls, at least three more than in any other game under Postecoglou, with the honours split evenly across the team and Pedro Porro the only starting outfielder not to pitch in.",
      "It prevented Manchester United from establishing any momentum and reached a glorious crescendo around the hour mark, when Richarlison forced about five different stoppages in the space of a few seconds. He was a fitting leader of the sh*thousing charge.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester United never really did identify a coherent solution and much of that was down to the performance of Fernandes. So often their stimulus, the captain became a burden.",
      "It was his passes which were intercepted in the build-up to the Spurs goal, he who missed a huge chance with an unmarked header from Noussair Mazraoui’s ball in, he who caused so many attacks to break down with poor decisions executed imperfectly.",
      "His teammates should not escape censure for failing to step up and share the burden, but there was a tangible sense that this particular glare was too much for Fernandes to handle. Postecoglou did say he planned to “overwhelm” the Portuguese but the occasion and pressure seemed to do that too.",

      "",
      "14) Might he have switched places with Mason Mount to exert more influence? The England international was anonymous on the left, with all attacks filtered down the other side through Amad.",
      "The one chance which fell to Rasmus Hojlund did so through the fingers of Guglielmo Vicario when the Spurs keeper let a cross slip away, but Micky van de Ven did wonderfully to hook the Dane’s header away.",
      "Mount and Hojlund were substituted in the 71st minute as Amorim finally looked towards his bench for solutions, and while Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho did spark an improvement it was not enough.",
      "The change Manchester United needed to make throughout the second half finally arrived in the 90th minute with Kobbie Mainoo replacing Dorgu. They needed a ball-carrier, a disruptor, a change in approach from the surfeit of crosses Spurs were happily heading away.",
      "Amorim keeping five defenders on the pitch for so long when the opponent had shown no attacking intent since around the hour mark was baffling and it cost them. There was enough quality on that bench to make an impact but it was used sub-optimally.",
      "",
      "15) Postecoglou ultimately nailed his decisions in a way Amorim categorically did not. That started with one of the biggest calls of all: to leave out Heung-min Son.",
      "There were echoes of the 2019 Champions League final, when a blatantly unfit Harry Kane was given the nod by Mauricio Pochettino to start and he was predictably ineffective. Son had played the previous two Spurs games on his return from injury but could not have argued when Richarlison was named in his place.",
      "Son has been more patient and understanding than Spurs have had any right to expect over the years, but Postecoglou was right to overlook sentimentality and make a choice which benefitted the team. Richarlison justified it completely, as did Son’s shaky start when he came off the bench.",
      "When the captain did settle into the motion of the game he did his bit to help Spurs see it through. Perhaps no-one has done more over the years to earn that trophy.",
      "How apropos that Spurs and Kane ended their long waits in the same season; by staying to complete the journey Son might have overtaken the legacy of his former teammate as the best player in the club’s modern history.",

      "“In this moment, it’s a little bit of faith. So let’s see. Like I said before, coming here before in the flash, I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I’m not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation.",

      "“Of course, I am confident in my players, it’s my job to improve my players and to arrive in January (transfer window) to make a lot of changes was not possible because of all the problems we have to deal with. And then I had to assess the team. The problem it not just one player.”",

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 18:36, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."

      "Tottenham beat Manchester United 1-0 in the Europa League final thanks to Brennan Johnson's winner; Cristian Romero was a rock at the back for Ange Postecoglou's side while Micky van de Ven saved Spurs in second half; Bruno Fernandes, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund had nights to forget",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 01:18, UK",
      "Tottenham are Europa League champions, ending their 17-year wait for a trophy by beating Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao.",
      "Brennan Johnson's winner late in the first half was enough for the north Londoners to book a spot in the Champions League next season - and increased the pressure on Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, who will be subjected to their lowest-ever Premier League finish and nothing more.",
      "Got away with it, then became a hero. An early stumble but Rasmus Hojlund could not take advantage, and he then gifted a chance to the same United striker, only to be saved by Micky van de Ven's acrobatic heroics. Produced two good saves to deny Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw late on to redeem himself. At least one goalkeeper turned up…",
      "Two excellent halves for different reasons. The first half saw him use his wand of a right boot to create some good openings, then he had to be defensively secure in the second period.",
      "He's never lost a final and you can see why. The Argentina defender showed excellent awareness throughout as he marshalled his side's low block brilliantly, making more clearances than any other Spurs player. He even got into Harry Maguire's head when the United centre-back started to threaten in the box. Spurs have to keep him to develop - but will he stay?",
      "That clearance. That athleticism. The Dutchman was just as solid as Romero but his acrobatic heroics to deny Hojlund that leveller will be remembered just as much as Johnson's goal. What a way to make yourself a hero.",
      "Looked nervous early on, swiping at a Man Utd corner and getting turned by Amad Diallo too many times. But he then grew into it and shut down the United winger in the second half. His game was summed up by a great tackle in the box to deny Amad a decent opening, before breaking to set up Dominic Solanke's big chance for 2-0. He did so much running, it is no wonder he had to come off late on.",
      "Solid. Won the second-most duels out of any Spurs player on the pitch - behind Romero - and the second-most tackles behind Udogie. Will be one of the more underrated players from this success.",
      "Like Bissouma, a good water carrier, doing a lot of the dirty work without being spectacular. All three of Spurs' midfielders kept Bruno Fernandes very quiet, giving the Manchester United danger man next to no space.",
      "Superb cross for Spurs' opener - exactly what was needed after his side lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury for this big game. Did not hold the ball well enough but that did not really matter in the end. It was not punished.",
      "Caused all sorts of problems early doors for Luke Shaw and you could see his opener coming. That trademark run from back post to front under Ange Postecoglou's tactics is destined in Spurs' folklore for generations. Did his work in the other direction too.",
      "You felt for the Spurs forward - he did so much running off the ball without getting many touches. Should have done better with a chance on the break for 2-0 but set up a decent chance on the break for Heung-Min Son at the same time. An important moment.",
      "A shock inclusion over captain Son - but you can see why he got the call up. Less of an attacking presence and did not do much in the air against Noussair Mazraoui, but his defensive performance and selfless display was excellent. He was taken off with an injury, which showed how much he committed.",
      "Actually, you could see why the Spurs captain did not start. He came on and even then he struggled, being beaten in a race by Patrick Dorgu despite playing an hour less football than his counterpart. Has he lost his legs?",
      "Brought on to shore up the backline as another centre-back and helped with the low block, including one huge clearance from an Amad cross. Had half a chance from a free-kick but did not take it.",
      "Nervy, shaky, unconvincing in his decision-making. Onana's frequent reluctance to come out and claim crosses or back passes created nervousness in defence for United - and gave Spurs an invitation to cross. He was not totally at fault for Spurs' opener but the indecision took its toll. More cons than pros this season by quite a way - time for United to move on?",
      "Not great but not bad. Nearly caught out by the Spurs press in the first half but not helped out by more Onana indecision. He could have scored in the second half but it is harsh to criticise the second-youngest player to feature in a European final for Man Utd.",
      "The centre-back was player of the half for United in the first period - until the opener. Solid in defence, put his body on the line and caused issues in the other penalty box. But he then fell asleep towards the end of the half, letting too many balls bounce, including for Spurs' opener. He was rattled by Romero - no goalscoring heroics this time.",
      "Beaten easily by Johnson a couple of times early on so it was no real surprise to see him overcome by the same player for the goal. Not good enough with the ball either going forwards. A sharper Shaw may have fared better but United miss Lisandro Martinez in that position.",
      "Like Yoro, he cannot be blamed too much. Good in the air against Richarlison, including a good, well-timed header to deny the Brazilian early on at the back post. He won 12 duels overall and got forward well, setting up that glorious Bruno Fernandes chance. Harshly taken off but can understand the need to bring attack-minded Diogo Dalot on.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder had some flashpoints with some big tackles, which showed he could still deliver in a big game, but that is where his influence was limited to. You cannot help but think how he has gone from Champions League finals with Real Madrid to this.",
      "Anonymous throughout as the Man Utd captain struggled against Spurs' flat midfield three. His frustration was summed up by lashing out at Udogie to concede a free-kick and having a simple pass cut out by Johnson, which led to a Spurs counter attack. He then missed that big chance to level. It was just not a captain's performance.",
      "Not bad going forwards and got into good areas, but spent a lot of time tracking back to help Shaw out. The youngster did not communicate enough for Johnson's goal - he wil learn.",
      "United's bright spark. The young wide man caused Udogie a lot of problems and provided United's only two shots in the first half, plus the cross for Hojlund's decent chance just after the break. A light in a dismal Ruben Amorim era.",
      "From light to dark. Mount was given a chance and did not take it. Mount actually got in the way of his United team-mates a couple of times in the first half, while he lacked the final ball throughout. Rightly taken off as United's need for a goal became more urgent - and Alejandro Garnacho did more in four minutes than Mount did in 70. Matheus Cunha will take his slot next season, no doubt.",
      "The young forward's hold-up play was actually not bad. But United lacked a penalty box presence needed from a striker in a cup final. Needed to take that second-half chance from Amad's cross and unlucky to be denied by Van de Ven's stunning clearance. But Man Utd need better. Ten Premier League games without a shot, as well.",
      "Brought on for Hojlund and got as many yellow cards as he had shots. Just six touches of the ball in around 20 minutes. He's just not a striker, is he? But if Fernandes, Cunha and Amad are the No 10 options then where does it leave the Dutchman?",
      "Probably should have started given Mount's performance and kept out by Vicario well. But if he and Kobbie Mainoo are not trusted for a European final, where does it leave them in Ruben Amorim's plans, especially as they are both available to be sold for pure profit?"
