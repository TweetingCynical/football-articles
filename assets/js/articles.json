      "Sir Dave Brailsford is set to step back from his current role with Manchester United as Sir Jim Ratcliffe continues to change his hierarchy - which has so fair failed to yield any success at Old Trafford.",
      "The cycling supremo will return to his director of sport role for Ineos. He had previously stood down as team principal of Ineos Grenadiers when Ratcliffe purchased his stake in United and took charge of football operations. Brailsford was initially crucial to the change the new owners wanted to implement.",
      "The Times reports that Ratcliffe wants Brailsford to return to his former role so that he can oversee transitions elsewhere in Ineos sport portfolio whilst also reviving some of his focus on cycling. Brailsford is due to aid the Ineos Grenadiers management team of John Allert, the chief executive, and performance director Scott Drawer.",
      "Ratcliffe has remained committed to his cycling projects despite majorly cutting back in some of his other investments. Sponsorship of the All Blacks has ended and the British billionaire has also called time on his pursuit of the America's Cup.",
      "Despite the well documented struggles in Manchester Ratcliffe believes Brailsford has played a major role in the positive transitions that have been made. He's credited with changing the performance set-up and leading the £50m redevelopment of Carrington.",
      "The Ineos Sport's team unit led by Brailsford will again be managing Ratcliffe's other football investment, Ligue 1 club Nice, who failed to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "United have endured plenty of upheaval in the senior management since Ineos took over, some of it not welcome. Dan Ashworth was brought in to be the director of football but left after only five months in charge despite the club chasing him for a prolonged period when he was at Newcastle. The decisions taken by the hierarchy have also proved massively unpopular with a huge number of jobs cut.",
      "United's season finished with a whimper as they eventually ended in 15th - a new low in the Premier League. That came after they were beaten in the Europa League final by Tottenham, which cost them a spot in the Champions League and the riches that come with that.",
      "The hierarchy are also under the microscope as they look to make their latest managerial decision work. Ruben Amorim was bought in but has endured a horror few months. That comes after Ratcliffe's lieutenants chose to keep Erik ten Hag last summer, only to sack him shortly after.",

      "While Joe Cole’s suggestion that Michael Carrick might be an ideal successor to Ange Postecoglou seems more than a touch fanciful, the sacked Middlesbrough coach can expect no shortage of offers.",
      "After Boro’s tenth-placed finish in last season’s Championship, owner Steve Gibson has clearly deliberated long and hard over Carrick’s fate and the dismissal will not come as a great surprise to many of the club’s supporters.",
      "It is fair to say the reaction to Carrick’s departure from Middlesbrough fans has been mixed. There has certainly been no sense of uproar. But Gibson is letting go of a coach who still has the potential to become an elite operator.",
      "Having been at Middlesbrough for only a few months shy of three years, there is an argument that says Carrick has been given plenty of time. But remember Middlesbrough’s predicament when Carrick took over in October, 2022.",
      "They had 17 points from 16 games and were a point above the relegation zone. Carrick’s impact and influence would see Middlesbrough finish fourth that season before losing to Coventry City in the play-offs.",
      "Ok, that was two years ago but it was a remarkable spell of management. The ‘decline’ into eighth position in the 2023-24 season and into tenth last season has cost Carrick his job, even though Gibson had given him a new three-year contract last summer.",
      "The stark truth is that tenth place was a disappointment. There were mitigating circumstances, not least the injury to on-loan Liverpool winger Ben Doak and the sale of top scorer Emmanuel Latte Lath in the winter window.",
      "Gibson, though, did back Carrick but certain recruitment decisions did not work out as well as might have been expected. Morgan Whittaker, for example, has not set the club alight since his £5million move from Plymouth Argyle. Despite finishing outside the play-offs, Carrick thought he had a good foundation for a more sustained challenge next season but knows that time is not readily afforded to Championship managers.",
      "In fact, before his dismissal, Carrick had been the longest-serving manager at that level … and had not been in his post for three full seasons. Carrick is still learning.",
      "Should Postecoglou and Spurs part company, Cole reckons Carrick could be a good appointment for Levy. It is safe to assume the chances of that happening are slim and none.",
      "But Carrick only turns 44 next month and, despite this setback, has a very good reputation for a thoughtful coaching approach that was first seen when he was on the staff at Manchester United, the club for whom he played with such distinction. (Don’t forget, in his caretaker spell at Old Trafford, he won two, drew one and lost none.)",
      "As a player, Carrick’s tally of 34 England caps was under-representative of his talent but he is exactly the sort of English coach who the Football Association should be monitoring.",
      "For now, though, he will surely want to get back into club management pretty quickly and while Levy and Tottenham Hotspur are unlikely to come knocking any time soon, someone is going to get a very good coach … and one with a point to prove.",

United have targeted Cameroon star Mbeumo as their second summer signing, having already recruited Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m after triggering his release clause.",
      "But Brentford are understood to value Mbeumo as the same value as Cunha and are not prepared to accept anything less than a similar price if they are to let him leave this summer. Brentford are also said to be willing to hold out until deadline day on September 1 if that is what it takes for United to meet their asking price for 25-year-old Mbeumo.",
      "The Bees are under no pressure to sell Mbeumo, with the club holding an option to exercise an extra year on his current deal, which still has one season left to run. Against that backdrop, they are relaxed about Mbeumo's situation, with the pressure on United to meet their valuation if they are serious about wanting the player.",
      "United are facing additional pressure in their pursuit of Mbeumo, with his Brentford team-mate and fellow forward Yoane Wissa, 28, the subject of interest from Saudi Pro League clubs.",
      "Brentford are unwilling to lose both Mbeumo and Wissa this summer, which means if the latter does secure a big-money move to a Saudi club, United face losing out on the former if they leave it too late.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is convinced Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals and provided eight assists last season for Brentford, would be an ideal fit for his 3-4-3 system.",

      "Mbeumo's versatility is one of the reasons Amorim is so keen to sign him, with the forward able to operate in a variety of roles across the front line, including on the right and up front.",
      "His pace, with and without the ball, allied to his ability to create and finish chances clinically, are qualities United are crying out for, with the burden having fallen squarely on Fernandes last season.",

      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane scoffed at Thierry Henry's claim that former Arsenal and Chelsea man Ashley Cole is the best left-back he has seen. Henry insisted that the ex-England defender doesn't get the credit he deserves on the back of his unceremonious move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Hale End graduate Cole began his Gunners career in 1999 when he made his full debut, and would go on to establish himself under Arsene Wenger as one of the Premier League's finest full-backs. The Englishman won two league titles in north London as well as three FA Cup trophies, and was pivotal in the club's famous 2003/04 Invincibles campaign.",
      "While Cole, who played over 200 times for Arsenal, saw his Gunners legacy somewhat tarnished in 2006 when he joined bitter rivals Chelsea in an acrimonious switch, Henry believes he still doesn't get the recognition he deserves as one of English football's finest ever left-backs. Though Red Devils legend Keane slightly disagrees.",
      "\"There is a guy that I want to talk about, who I don't understand why in this country he doesn't get his respect: Ashley Cole,\" Henry stated on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Ashley Cole was outstanding.",
      "\"Firstly, in 2000, Ashley went to Crystal Palace on loan, and he saved them from relegation, playing as a winger. When you have a left-back that can dribble past their winger, he was the one who created space for the rest of the team at Arsenal. He started everything.",
      "\"For me, Ashley Cole is the best left-back I have ever seen. Me. I'm not talking about everybody. Ashley Cole… Going forward, defending, the desire, what he won and why he won it.\"",
      "While Henry sang the praises of his former team-mate, who he played alongside a staggering 195 times in the red of Arsenal, Keane then chimed in. \"I think he was a brilliant player, but when you talk about great left-backs, he doesn't spring to my mind,\" quipped Keane. \"Of course, he was a brilliant player.\"",
      "Henry rebuked Keane's claim and went on to discuss Cole's controversial and bad-blooded move from the north of London to the west, explaining he feels it is why the left-back isn't quite held in the regard he deserves. He continued: \"Ashley Cole is an Arsenal man.",
      "\"His whole family supports Arsenal. But I can understand why he left at the time. In 2005, David Dein shook hands on a deal, but he came back with something else.",
      "\"With Ashley moving to Chelsea, people don't give him the respect he deserves for everything that he has done. But for me, Cole was outstanding.\"",
      "Former Arsenal vice-chairman Dein oversaw plenty of successes during his 24 years in the role, but he previously admitted that letting the left-back leave was one of his biggest regrets before stepping down in 2007.",
      "Cole was offered a hefty pay rise by Stamford Bridge chiefs and he went on to enjoy a fruitful eight-year spell with the club, winning one league title, a Champions League, Europa League, League Cup, Community Shield and four FA Cups. He's considered very much in the debate of the greatest left-backs of all time alongside the likes of Roberto Carlos, Marcelo and Paolo Maldini.",

The 25-year-old forward is poised to move in the summer transfer window after enjoying a stand-out season that has thrust him into the spotlight.",
      "Mbeumo racked up 20 goals and eight assists in 38 Premier League matches for Brentford this season and was one of the league’s stand-out players. He has been linked with Newcastle, Liverpool and Tottenham, but it is Manchester United who are understood to be the most keen on the £50million-rated forward.",
      "The Bees star is keen to play European football – a factor that could count against United – after working his way into the top tier of Premier League forwards. Mbeumo has been at Brentford for six years, having joined from French side Troyes when they were in the Championship.",
      "His form for Brentford has earned admiring glances before – and just not from rival clubs. Back in the summer of 2022 it was legendary former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto’o who was keeping an eye on him in his role as president of the Cameroon Football Federation.",
      "Mbeumo was born in France and played for Les Bleus’ from under-17 to under-21 level, but never received a senior call-up. His dad is from Cameroon and Eto’o came to see Mbeumo with a proposal ahead of the 2022 World Cup.",
      "“It was just the two of us, I met him in a restaurant,” Mbeumo told the Brentford club website back in November 2022. “He came to London to see me. I know from my dad, who’s Cameroonian, that it could be a good opportunity.",
      "“When he approached me in the first place, I didn’t know if I would go or not. But after speaking to him, he explained to me about the project and I was happy with it. Afterwards, he gave me a bit of time to think about it before I gave my decision, and then I decided to play for them.",
      "“I was a bit nervous to meet him! He’s a legend of African football and football in general. I also asked him questions about being a striker, how he did certain things, how he dealt with certain situations, and he gave me advice. Talking about football with him was great.”",
      "He added: “I’m very proud for me and my family to represent the country. My dad was very happy – I also did this for him. I knew how proud he would be and he felt amazing after I made my debut and played those two games.”",
      "Mbeumo now has 22 caps and six goals for Cameroon and is hoping to take the next step in his club career this summer. While he wants to keep hold of him, Brentford manager Thomas Frank knows his star player is capable of taking a step up – even if it is to a team, like United, who finished five places lower this season.",
      "“I always knew he was a goalscorer. Now he’s now just a more consistent goalscorer. His hold-up play is even better, his assist play or link-up play, his work ethic is fantastic. So very impressed.”",

A deal to sign Mbeumo is not yet done, with the 25-year-old believed to be demanding a £250,000-per-week deal.",

Captain Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire are widely regarded as United's only ‘leaders’ amid widespread attitude concerns within the squad.",

And while many Sunderland fans would be content if he was the only star they see leave in the coming months, there are fears that others could join him in parting ways with the Stadium of Light.",

      "Centre-half Chris Mepham arrived at the Stadium of Light last August in a season-long loan from Bournemouth, and while he was quickly able to win over the hearts of many Sunderland fans, the 27-year-old is set to return to his parent club unless the Black Cats submit a tempting offer.",

      "The Cameroon star, 25, has been identified by United as their next priority signing after concluding a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolves. And despite interest from elsewhere in the form of Arsenal and Newcastle, Mbeumo has indicated his preference would be to join the Red Devils.",
      "Mbeumo is coming off the back of a standout season for Brentford after breaking the 20 goal barrier in the Premier League for the first time.",
      "United are set to approach Brentford imminently to try and thrash out a deal for the versatile forward, who is valued by the Londoners in excess of £60million. But Mbeumo's desire for a significant salary increase means the overall package of a deal for the Bees talisman will not be cheap.",
      "As first revealed by The Times, Mbeumo currently earns £50,000-a-week at Brentford; he's looking to increase that FIVE-FOLD should he move to Old Trafford.",

      "Mbeumo's goal tally last season was among the best in the league with only Mo Salah, Erling Haaland and Alexander Isak bettering his 20 strikes. To put those returns into context, Bruno Fernandes and Amad were United's joint-top scorers in the Premier League last season with eight goals.",

And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",

      "Keen to offload him as quickly as possible, Napoli are unlikely to dig their heels in. It is understood his release clause is valued at £64million, meaning it is an attractive price for a striker so reliable in front of goal.",
      "United, though, do not have a bottomless pit of money this summer, meaning the prospect of them adding Osimhen and Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha without cutting their cloth is fanciful. They need to raise funds via player sales and they are eager to sell Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to name just a few.",
      "However, with Napoli eager to resolve Osimhen's future as quickly as possible, it puts pressure on United to shift their wantaway players just as fast. The window will temporarily close again next week before reopening on June 16.",
      "United, if they sell the likes of Rashford and Garnacho, will be hoping to bank around £80m as a minimum, meaning they have assets that can be sold to fund a deal for Osimhen, who has previously admitted playing in the Premier League is his \"dream\".",
      "Previously, a move for Osimhen would have been considered impossible amid the fact United cannot offer any form of European football for next season. The events of the last few days, however, have proven they still remain an enormous attraction."

      "Remember Lisandro Martinez? He could return from a serious injury around the new season.",
      "The worst was feared when Martinez fell to the ground against Crystal Palace in February, as his knee buckled as he landed and he looked distraught as he was stretched off the pitch.",
      "The bad news was subsequently confirmed: Martinez tore the cruciate ligament in his knee. United did not communicate a timeline on when he could return, but Martinez was expected to face a lengthy spell of between six and nine months on the sidelines, depending on how his rehabilitation progressed.",
      "Martinez suffered the knee injury at the beginning of February and four months have passed, so it would probably be a stretch to expect him to feature during pre-season games in July.",
      "The beginning of August could be a possible return date for Martinez, though, at least to be working on grass, which suggests he could be available for selection shortly after the new season begins.",
      "United will not rush Martinez back to prevent aggravating the injury, but August seems a realistic target for him to work toward and a September return might even be in the back of his mind.",
      "It's common for players with serious injuries to set provisional dates to target their return so they can be motivated during the rehabilitation process, which can be mentally challenging.",
      "Martinez was spotted on a handful of matchdays at the end of the campaign. The 27-year-old joined the celebrations after beating Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford and he arrived with the squad, wearing a Paul Smith club suit, at the Estadio de San Mames for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The defender also took part in the lap of appreciation at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. He was joined by his wife and newborn, and was spotted waving at supporters.",
      "Martinez quickly became a fan favourite after his arrival from Ajax in the summer of 2022, but he has missed chunks of time on the pitch due to injuries and his form dropped this season.",
      "The Argentina international was previously considered undroppable. He was one of the first names on the team sheet. However, Martinez will not go immediately back into the starting XI when he gets back up to speed following his lay-off.",
      "It goes without saying that a player returning from a serious injury wouldn't start straight away, but Martinez will be forced to fight for his place when he's considered 100 per cent fit.",
      "Martinez's performances were mixed this term and some displays were a far cry from those he produced in his first season in Manchester, which earned him popularity among fans.",
      "Ruben Amorim did not consider dropping Martinez because he was the only left-footed centre-back in the squad. But everything changed when Ayden Heaven was signed in January and, more importantly, when Amorim experimented by starting Leny Yoro on the left side of the defensive trio.",
      "Yoro has been excellent since his relocation to the left. The Frenchman grew in confidence with each month during his first season and he ended the campaign strongly in that role.",
      "The 19-year-old will be nailed on to start in that position on the opening day of the new season and it will be fascinating to see whether Martinez can win that role back, provided each defensive option is fit.",
      "Martinez has gone from having no competition for his role to having Yoro and Heaven breathing down his neck, which should help him raise his level when he returns from his knee injury.",
      "There is finally competition for the left-sided centre-back role in Amorim's system."

It's reported that Betis are willing to increase their financial commitment to the deal, which would cover a higher portion of his salary.",

His form has attracted attention from wider Europe, meanwhile, with Juventus the latest team to show an interest, as they look to strengthen their squad after securing Champions League qualification.",

Although Juve finished fourth in Serie A last season, they scored just 58 goals from their 38 league matches - fewer than eighth-place AC Milan - and are keen to add more firepower to their squad.",
      "Speaking after the Conference League final last month, Antony, who has two years left to run of his United contract, issued an update on his future and hinted at another move to Betis. He told CBS Sports: \"I don't what will happen in the future, only God knows. My work is playing and I'm doing that well.",

      "Another club has reportedly joined the race to sign Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho.",

      "A fresh report from Spanish news outlet AS has claimed that Aston Villa have now joined the race to sign Garnacho. Bayer Leverkusen, who have former United boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager, have also expressed an interest in Garnacho, according to the report.",
      "Garnacho's market value has dramatically increased since he enjoyed his breakthrough season at United in 2022/23. Transfermarkt states that Garnacho's value currently stands at €45million (£37.9million).",
      "This is an increase from the start of the 2022/23 season, where Garnacho's value was at €4million (£3.4million). However, Garnacho's value did reach a high of €50million (£42million) last October before decreasing to it's current figure back in March.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" Garnacho said when asked about his future following the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club.",
      "\"I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\""

      "Jamie Carragher has dismissed a fan's assertion that Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is worth £100million, stating unequivocally \"no one's paying that\" in the Premier League. Despite sustaining a groin injury that sidelined him for three months, Wharton's performances in midfield have played a pivotal role in propelling Palace to their first-ever FA Cup victory.",
      "Upon recovery, Wharton immediately reclaimed his spot in the starting line-up and has been a consistent fixture on the team sheet.",
      "The 21-year-old midfielder earned his first England cap after Gareth Southgate called him up for Euro 2024 last summer.",
      "Wharton's stellar performance this season has sparked rumours of a move to one of the top Premier League clubs, with Manchester United one of the teams linked with an interest in the midfielder. Man City are also said to have the England man as a long-term target.",
      "The talk surrounding his future prompted a supporter during The Overlap Fan Debate to suggest that Wharton is worth a fee of £100 million.",
      "Carragher, alongside co-host Paul Scholes, was taken aback, sharply responding: \"£100m? No one's paying £100m for Adam Wharton. I like Adam Wharton. Anyone who pays £100m for him you're mad. £100m?! Oh my god. £100m for Adam Wharton? You wouldn't buy him for £100m don't be daft,\" he said, as per the Mirror.",
      "Scholes shared in the surprise at the fan's valuation, humorously questioning: \"£100m? Is that with his wages for 20 years or...? He's a good player but not £100m.\"",
      "The banter left the supporter clearly amused as they were teased by the Liverpool legend, prompting laughter from the rest of the fans present in the studio.",
      "Although Carragher does not seem to have the utmost admiration for Wharton, the player is highly regarded by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who has complimented him on several occasions.",
      "Prior to City's 5-2 victory over Palace in April, the Spaniard stated: \"He's an excellent holding midfielder. His impact has been really good coming from the Championship to the Premier League. Really good left foot. Really good player.\"",
      "Wharton was substituted during that heavy loss, but he was one of the standout players on the pitch as Palace beat City in their historic 1-0 win at Wembley to claim the FA Cup."

      "Sancho, 25, had an inconsistent season at Stamford Bridge but did manage to score in the Europa Conference League final victory over Real Betis. Nonetheless, it doesn't appear that was enough to convince Chelsea his stint should be extended.",
      "Enzo Maresca was reportedly eager to retain the winger, but Chelsea's top brass were unwilling to match the player's demands. It's understood Sancho is hopeful of maintaining his £300,000-a-week wages, though that will inevitably impact his options this summer.",
      "United were drawn into discussions about whether they would cover some of the wages remaining on his contract, which expires next summer. However, they decided not to intervene and will instead pocket the £5m fine and aim to sell him elsewhere.",

      "Amorim isn't believed to have any plans to reintegrate the player into his team as they proceed with a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. The Cameroonian is understood to have held talks with the club after United already secured the £62.5m signing of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "United are aiming to sell in order to generate additional funds for their summer overhaul and are counting on receiving some money for Sancho. And they would hope a Saudi offer could at least match the £25m they were due to receive from Chelsea.",
      "However, the £5m penalty fee provides them with at least some flexibility in their budgeting. This could be used to supplement the player's salary at another club if they don't secure a permanent solution with a Saudi heavyweight.",
      "United do not wish to loan Sancho out for the final year of his contract and see him leave for free next summer. However, the player is not opposed to this idea given it would mean he has more freedom deciding his own fate next summer."

      "The most surprising aspect of Manchester United's early transfer business this summer is that it is coming in the area of the pitch where they are arguably strongest.",
      "If they get a deal over the line to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford following the acquisition of Matheus Cunha to Wolves, it will add more No. 10s to Ruben Amorim's squad. Given the money spent on the proven Premier League performers, they will surely be starters next season.",
      "They join a growing list of options for those positions, which for now includes Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. Garnacho's expected departure will create some leeway for transfers, and Mainoo's future is hardly secure just yet.",
      "Mount enjoyed his best spell of football for United towards the end of last season and is an Amorim favourite, but he hasn't done enough to warrant being a first-choice in that position. Fernandes certainly has, and his decision to turn down Al-Hilal's advances should mean another year of consistent performances at Old Trafford, but his future could lie more often in a deeper midfield role. He played that position regularly last season without any real impact on his contribution in the final third.",
      "Cunha is clearly an ideal fit for the position, having excelled there in the same system under Vitor Pereira at Wolves. He brings an understanding of the role and more creativity and goal threat than someone like Mount.",
      "Mbeumo spent last season playing on the wing for Brentford, but could slot in as a No. 10. He has played centrally previously and, like Cunha, would significantly add to the attacking threat in a United squad that has struggled for goals.",
      "The 25-year-old could operate as a striker as well, although he might not be an ideal fit for what Amorim wants from a No. 9. Instead, his close control and dribbling ability could make him a better option between the lines. He also brings balance, something Amorim reflected on in December when he first moved Amad into a No. 10 role, after initially using him as a wing-back.",
      "\"He can be a good player in that position,\" Amorim said. \"We need left-footed players in this team to play that role. In the first half, he was coming for the ball too much. He needed to play near the opposition defence more. He will improve in the future for sure.”",
      "That comment came after United's win against Viktoria Plzen and signalled an almost permanent shift to Amad operating as a No. 10, but the interest in Mbeumo could yet signal a change of plan there.",
      "Given his impact last season, Amad is almost a guaranteed starter in 2025/26, which either means Mbeumo plays centre-forward or Amad drops into right wing-back.",
      "He has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "This summer is clearly going to be transformative for United. Adding goals and creativity to the team is vital for Amorim, and bringing Mbeumo in as an attacker and shifting Amad to wing-back fulfils that brief.",
      "It will also offer the head coach versatility. Mbeumo could play as a No. 9 and a No. 10, and Amad could play wing-back and No. 10. There are options there, for Amorim has also prioritised players who can operate in a couple of different roles for his system. A move for Mbeumo would deliver just that."

      "Chelsea have reportedly offered West Ham seven players in exchange for £85m forward Mohammed Kudus this summer in a bid to beat Manchester United to his signature.",
      "It was announced by The Athletic’s David Ornstein on Tuesday that Chelsea would not be taking up their £25m obligation to buy Jadon Sancho this summer after a loan spell at Stamford Bridge last season.",
      "Sancho and the Blues could not agree on personal terms and Chelsea will now be forced to pay a £5m penalty instead for not taking up the obligation.",
      "After the news was revealed, Sancho took to Instagram to pen a farewell message to Chelsea fans, he wrote: “Grateful for the experience. Big love to everyone at Chelsea who made me feel at home – team-mates, staff, and the fans.",
      "“Wishing the club all the best moving forward. Truly grateful, thank you Blues.”",
      "The Blues are therefore in the market for a new forward to play to the side of a central striker and it’s claimed they have reignited their interest in Kudus having been linked with the 24-year-old when he made his £38m to West Ham from Ajax in the summer of 2023.",
      "And according to transfer expert Graeme Bailey, the Blues have offered the Hammers seven players in a swap deal for Kudus, who reportedly has an £85m release clause.",
      "Robert Sanchez has been brought up in talks as they look to bring Milan’s Mike Maignan in as they’re new No.1, while midfielders Carney Chukwuemeka and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall as well as defenders Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Axel Disasi and Trevoh Chalobah have also been offered up in exchange.",
      "He told The Chelsea Chronicle: “So, I’m told that there’s been talk with West Ham a little bit about possibly looking at Kudus and with players in exchange.",
      "“I believe that Chelsea were offering Sanchez and Dewsbury-Hall but West Ham didn’t want that particularly, so yeah that’s an interesting one. Kudos, again a name who could be one to keep an eye on but obviously if it means Chelsea getting these players out. Dewsbury-Hall, we know is someone who can go. Robert Sanchez is one who they’re willing to let go which tells us about the goalkeeper situation.",
      "“West Ham we know were interested in Chalobah, Disasi, Tosin and Badiashile I think two or three of them are going to leave, but I think they want money for them, especially Tosin and Chalobah, because of the pure profit. I think Chukwuemeka has been mentioned as well to West Ham.”",

      "A report earlier on Wednesday claimed Manchester United have also tried to tempt West Ham into a swap deal for Kudus, offering Sancho in exchange.",
      "The report added that West Ham and Man Utd ‘couldn’t reach an agreement, so it currently seems unlikely that this will go through’.",
      "Kudus has been the subject of interest from Liverpool and Arsenal during his time in England, while there have also been links to Saudi Arabia, but the midfielder ‘would prefer to stay in Europe’.",

      "Inter have asked for permission to speak to Fabregas and some reports suggest he is on the verge of taking over at the Champions League finalists.",
      "If that is the case, he would of course have no say on the future of Paz – unless he wanted to sign him for Inter – and whoever takes over at Como would not have the same connection Fabregas has with the midfielder, and could be open to his sale.",

      "Manchester City are heavily represented in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Matheus Cunha is in but No 1) will never be shifted.",
      "",
      "1) Neymar – £200m/€222m (Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2017)\nA fee so ridiculous La Liga refused to receive the payment so PSG said LOL to FFP and handed the money straight to Barcelona, activating one of those stratospheric release clauses designed to typically make such transfers essentially impossible.",
      "",
      "2) Eden Hazard – £143m/€160m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, July 2019)\nThe initial payment of £88.5m alone would have been a disastrous transfer, but Hazard accidentally activated enough variables in between numerous injuries before his retirement to make this an all-time great waste of money.",
      "",
      "3) Philippe Coutinho – £142m/€160m (Liverpool to Barcelona, January 2018)\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint the most damning aspect of this deal from a buyer’s perspective, but it’s somewhere between the £106m initial fee, the £26.4m in clauses paid out for Coutinho’s first 90 appearances, the £89m premium Barcelona reluctantly agreed to pay if they signed any further Liverpool players in the next two years, the fact Coutinho won the Champions League with Bayern Munich while on loan from the Nou Camp, scoring twice in the 8-2 quarter-final humiliation of the Catalans, or the knockdown price of £17m paid by Aston Villa after four underwhelming years.",
      "",
      "4) Ousmane Dembele – £135m/€147m (Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, August 2017)\nWith a bruised ego and the Neymar cash burning a hole in their back pocket, Barcelona had tried all summer to sign Coutinho but after facing resistance from Liverpool, they went cap in hand to Dortmund for their back-up instead. And lessons were learned with a £369.6m release clause inserted this time – not that the Frenchman has ever come close to warranting such lavish interest until he found his ambipedal feet at PSG.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Felix – £113m/€126m (Benfica to Atletico Madrid, July 2019)\nPerhaps the worst match of player and manager there has ever been for a club-record transfer. How strange that the skilful individualist forward who doesn’t track back never meshed with a totalitarian coach who demands suffering and sacrifice from his subordinates. How strange that Atletico committed such sums on a teenager with 45 career first-team appearances. How strange that they couldn’t find anyone to buy him until Chelsea rocked up again.",
      "",
      "6) Antoine Griezmann – £107m/€120m (Atletico Madrid to Barcelona, July 2019)\nAfter The Decision favoured Atletico in 2018, the Frenchman could no longer avoid the Barcelona pull a year later in a sale which enraged Los Rojiblancos, considering a £180m release clause had only expired a couple of weeks before. Griezmann has somehow managed to remain without a La Liga winner’s medal through it all, timing his moves back and forth to Atletico and Barca comedically poorly.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish – £100m/€117.5m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nWhile it looked like an ungainly fit at first, Grealish went an awfully long way towards justifying his astronomical fee as a key part of a Treble-winning, mass-celebrating machine in his second season at the Etihad. Then it all started to fall apart again as he lost his way.",
      "",
      "8) Neymar – £86.3m/€100m (Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal, August 2023)\nThat world-record, market-breaking move to France delivered neither the Ballon d’Or nor the non-Barcelona Champions League that Neymar craved, so the Brazilian decided to cheat by joining the most successful side in AFC Champions League history for loadsa money, loadsa cars, loadsa bedrooms and loadsa saunas. A ruptured knee ligament meant he played seven times in Saudi Arabia before being released by mutual consent.",
      "",
      "9) Gareth Bale – £85.2m/€100m (Tottenham to Real Madrid, September 2013)\nAfter cramming half of his total Premier League goals by that point into a single phenomenal season, Bale became the latest obsession of a Real Madrid side desperate to win La Decima. The Welshman helped deliver that in his first campaign with a decisive goal in the Champions League final – the first of five European Cups and second of 15 trophies for a player the supporters nevertheless came to hate.",
      "",
      "10) Antony – £82m/€95m (Ajax to Man Utd, September 2022)\nErik ten Hag put all his eggs in the Antony basket but a few must have cracked in transit from Amsterdam, the relatively slow and predominantly one-footed winger scoring eight goals and assisting three in a 44-game debut season.",

      "11) Jadon Sancho – £73m/€85m (Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd, July 2021)\nIn his three full seasons with Borussia Dortmund, Sancho’s least productive campaign was his first, when he scored 13 goals and provided 20 assists in 43 games. Across an entire Man Utd career which still technically remains a live thing after Chelsea paid £5m to return him rather than £25m to sign him, the forward has scored 12 goals and assisted six in 83 games.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe – £72m/€80m (Lille to Arsenal, August 2019)\nAfter offering the closest challenge to Kylian Mbappe for the Ligue Un Golden Boot, Arsenal spent what was a club-record fee on a player who has popped up around France, Turkey and Spain since being long outgrown by the upwardly mobile Gunners.",

      "13) Neymar – £71.5m/€86.2m (Santos to Barcelona, June 2013)\nThe financial details are wonderfully murky but official documents submitted to the authority revealed the final fee, as well as a €40m payment to Neymar’s parents.",
      "",
      "14) Kai Havertz – £71m/€80m (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, September 2020)\nExpensive flop who never fit into one defined position and suffered for regular managerial upheaval? Or scorer of the winning goals in the Champions League and Club World Cup finals? A little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "",
      "15) Julian Alvarez – £64m/€75.8m (Manchester City to Atletico Madrid, August 2024)\nThe fee could rise to £80m but eyebrows were raised when Manchester City squeezed quite so much out of Atletico, even for a world champion with 54 goal contributions and six trophies in 103 appearances. A 29-goal debut season in Spain made it seem more as though the Premier League side had been fleeced.",
      "",
      "16) James Rodriguez – £63m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nA proper throwback transfer pretty much solely down to Rodriguez starring at the World Cup, the Colombian won a fair few trinkets at the Bernabeu but never came close to settling or justifying that fee.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Cunha – £62.5m/€74.2m (Wolves to Man Utd, June 2025)\nIn a welcome sign they are returning to a formerly successful transfer policy, Manchester United chucked a whole load of money at a team below them in the Premier League’s bottom half by virtue of goal difference alone.",
      "",
      "18) Kai Havertz – £62m/€71.7m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nMikel Arteta saw enough in those three mixed years at Stamford Bridge to deem Havertz crucial to his Arsenal process. Almost no-one else thought it was a signing worth making but the vision has become clearer over time, particularly so in the German’s injury-enforced absence.",
      "",
      "19) Mykhaylo Mudryk – £62m/€70m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, January 2023)\nThe biggest possible fee is the one most often quoted but Chelsea would be absolutely delighted if they end up paying the full £88.5m/€100m for Mudryk, who is embroiled in a drugs test fiasco.",

      "20) Riyad Mahrez – £60m/€68m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nAn underappreciated Premier League legend only reinforced his status at Manchester City.

Not when it can also be used as a cudgel with which to attack an uppity woman.",
      "We’ll start at the start, because it’s already very odd.",
      "Pardon the pun, but we have run out of superlatives for Joe Root.",
      "Eh? Is the pun there literally the presence of the words ‘run out’? Is that it? That this is what Crossy thinks we should be pardoning here only gets more amusing as this goes on.",
      "At the age of 34, Root is setting records which might never be broken. Living proof to professional athletes around him of how longevity is one of the main stamps of greatness. I wonder if Mary Earps has taken note?",
      "Sorry, what? That’s one crunching gear change.",
      "Last week Earps called time on her international career. The decision followed a meeting with England manager Sarina Wiegman, in which she was told she wouldn’t be her number one goalkeeper at the Euros.",
      "So instead of digging in, in a bid to win back her place in the team, Earps took the easier option. Now we know the real reasons she was known as ‘Mary, Queen of Stops’.",
      "Now there’s the pun you should be seeking forgiveness for.",
      "Cross goes on to point out that retiring was an option Root could have chosen when relinquishing the England Test captaincy back in 2022.",
      "He was England’s second highest run scorer in Tests at the time. The Yorkshireman had nothing left to prove.",
      "Well, we can think of one thing left to prove; there’s a hint right there in the previous sentence. But that’s not really the point. We’re not really sure what the point actually is.",
      "But Root realised people like him are a long time retired. He still had a love of batting and a heck of a lot more to give. And unlike Earps, when the going got tough, Root got going.",
      "Since relinquishing the captaincy to focus solely on batting, Root has gone on to smash bowlers to all four corners of the world. He has overtaken Sir Alastair Cook as England’s greatest Test run scorer.",
      "Look, Joe Root is lovely and brilliant and all the rest of it, but this is a genuinely insane comparison.",
      "These are not remotely comparable situations. When he gave up the captaincy, Root was 31 years old and unquestionably still England’s best batter. There was no suggestion whatsoever he might lose his place in England’s first-choice XI, as Earps has.",
      "Faced with entirely different situations, Root wanted to carry on and Earps didn’t. Both are entirely valid choices and neither really any of our business.",
      "You don’t have to like the choice Earps has made, and especially the way it’s all played out, but you do have to acknowledge that her situation and Root’s are not in any useful or meaningful way the same, and not just because they play completely different sports.",

      "Manchester United should sign Jamie Vardy. Stop laughing, I’m serious.",
      "Those, including my F365 colleagues, with whom I’ve already shared this most scalding of takes have reacted with a mixture of hilarity and concern for my wellbeing. So I’ve given it further consideration and I’m doubling down; United absolutely should sign Vardy.",
      "Here for free – important, that – is a proven goalscorer, a fox in the box, a nasty b*stard (meant entirely as a compliment) and a title winner who could take the number of Premier League champions in the Old Trafford dressing room to… one. Vardy would be an asset to Ruben Amorim, putting him in a very select group of Manchester United footballers.",
      "I’m not ignoring the obvious point of contention: Vardy is old. Thirty-eight. Which in footballer years is ancient.",
      "But he hasn’t got as many miles on the clock as veterans of a similar age. Vardy’s professional career started at 24; his Football League career at 25. Most of his contemporaries reach 14 years as a senior pro between 32 and 34.",
      "And United absolutely don’t need Vardy for the future. Their outlay on wages will not be recouped and there will be no resale value. Not every signing can be viewed in such terms. But signing the ex-England striker could be seen as an investment in the younger forwards who so clearly need the spark and guidance Vardy could offer.",
      "But more than a mentor, Vardy can still show how it’s done. In a genuinely awful Leicester side, he scored more Premier League goals than any United player last season, and in 35 appearances, he played more minutes than all but two of Amorim’s outfielders.",
      "Right now, Amorim has one centre-forward he can call upon: Rasmus Hojlund. And they would sell him without hesitation if someone offered half the price they paid in 2023. The chances of that seem as low as the Dane’s goals record last season. And his confidence. But if they get him some help, in terms of service and a stand-in, it could yet work out if United are forced to make the best of him.",
      "That is especially true since Liam Delap thought Chelsea – Todd Boehly’s Chelsea – were better trusted with his development. Even if Delap had been convinced to join United, they would still have needed a more experienced striker given they currently have none.",
      "They might sign Bryan Mbeumo. And many would expect that to be a savvy addition. But what would they be signing in Mbeumo? Certainly not an out-and-out striker. Much of the appeal is the Cameroonian’s ability to play across the front line. He scored 20 goals last season, many of them while drifting in from the Brentford right, and it seems Amorim eyes Mbeumo more as a no.10.",
      "🔴⚪⚫ MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Every signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?\n👉 Mbeumo to Manchester United will be among the biggest steps down in transfer history\n👉 Mood rankings: United not the most miserable club in Manchester",
      "With Matheus Cunha already waiting to welcome Mbeumo if United stop irritating Brentford for long enough to get a deal done, United suddenly have creative options beyond Bruno Fernandes, who could be used in the deeper role Amorim liked for his skipper for much of last season.",
      "But what good is all that creativity without someone to apply the finishing touch? If United somehow muster the money to buy a proven no.9 – not another 9.5 – their centre-forward pool is still perilously shallow, even allowing for the lighter workload without European involvement.",
      "United haven’t been scared of recruiting veteran strikers. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was 35; Henrik Larsson was 34. Both were big hits at Old Trafford, for their influence in the dressing room as much as their impact in the box.",
      "Vardy could have a similar impact. He insists he is not looking to wind down after leaving Leicester, and Ruud van Nistelrooy offered a glowing reference: “He is one of the most open and honest people I have met…he isn’t hard to manage.”",
      "Like Zlatan for Jose Mourinho and Larsson for Fergie, Vardy would be a leader for Amorim, a manager with pitifully few such characters to lean on, and a goal threat where currently there is almost none.",

      "“There were three categories to the policy,” the pundit said. “He wanted to promote youth wherever possible, that was number one before he even looked at the external market.”",
      "If “promote” is actually a synonym for “offload” – and in the dictionary of Big Sir Jim most things seem to be – then consider that box ticked by Man Utd in 2025.",

      "The signing of Matheus Cunha, pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo and potential targeting of more stars close to home suggests the dying art which underpinned so much of the club’s modern success has been resuscitated.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund, Manuel Ugarte, Antony, Andre Onana. The list goes on.",
      "The second point is the most pertinent to the current era and provides long-overdue proof of some joined-up thinking with recruitment at Carrington. Mbeumo and Cunha were the two biggest overperformers on xG in the Premier League last season, are 25 and 26 and feel like precisely the sort of signings Liverpool would make under Jurgen Klopp: players proven in the ever-improving middle of England’s top flight, but with an obvious scalability to develop and perform at a higher level.",

      "That comes with caveats: one season of xG overperformance presents obvious issues with sustainability and these are extortionate costs for a club publicly walking a PSR tightrope, who need to nail every aspect of their transfer business this summer. But if the argument was that sacrificing Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo would only be for the greater good if Man Utd could be trusted to spend the money properly, removing their erratic and unreliable recruitment from the equation to simply buy the closest things to guaranteed successes might make it work.",
      "Ferguson leaned on those intra-Premier League transfers to build the foundation for each of his great Man Utd squads. There were some David Bellions along the way but a ludicrous XI can be assembled from such signings: Van der Sar; Valencia, Smalling, Ferdinand, Young; Keane, Carrick, Smith; Tevez, Yorke, Rooney, with Robin van Persie, Dimitar Berbatov, Teddy Sheringham and Phil Jones on an absurdly attacking bench.",
      "But in the years since his retirement it was an ideology slowly phased out for style over substance, culminating in the ruinous summer of 2021. Man Utd were at a crossroads, Premier League and Europa League runners-up with fairly deep runs in the domestic cups behind them, but with a strong sense that while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had built a solid base, he had reached a point where someone else was required to push on and capitalise on his work.",
      "Man Utd avoided answering that awkward question and signed players from Real Madrid, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund instead, because they wanted the honour and esteem of being seen to deal with such clubs without a second thought as to whether Raphael Varane, Cristiano Ronaldo or Jadon Sancho actually added more to the squad than they took away, and Solskjaer was sacked within a matter of months.",
      "The club chose the wrong path then, in their last true position of strength in summer 2023 when they hedged one too many bets on Onana, Mason Mount and Hojlund, and the following year when instead of sacking Erik ten Hag, they doubled down by spending £200m on players not only specifically for him, but categorically incompatible with the replacement they inevitably had to appoint.",
      "The hope is that hitting rock bottom can prompt better decisions at this latest seasonal junction; the early signs are promising. Neville once said “if you had the best player in the Premier League, Man Utd had to buy that player”. Times have changed and those signings have long been unattainable, but buying the best Premier League players actually available to them seems like a sensible alternative Man Utd have long ignored.",

That is a much more satisfying thing than all the rest. That is what I would say to players: ‘It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.’ That is what we need here. If somebody says: ‘But you don’t play Champions League next year’, then goodbye and thank you, have fun next year wherever you will be. We will find players or we have players already that will go our way. That is not my way, that is the normal way for a club not playing in the Champions League.”",
      "The German did not have to worry about it often, only coaching two full Liverpool seasons outside Europe’s elite competition, but it was true. The Reds signed Sadio Mane 88 days later and Klopp secured one of the strongest pushers of his Champions League train in the process.",
      "Not only were the Reds out of Europe altogether in summer 2016, but they had finished two places below the Southampton side they were buying from. Mane bet not only on himself but the Klopp vision. A Premier League, Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and Golden Boot suggests he was right.",
      "",
      "7) Moises Caicedo\nLiverpool supporters consumed dangerous and absurd levels of copium to come to terms with Caicedo’s decision to reject them in favour of joining Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "It was understandable to an extent. The Reds, managed by Jurgen Klopp, had just finished seven places higher than the Blues, who were a bastion of instability and player churn. The decision between the two seemed obvious once it was clear both were willing to make it worth Brighton’s trouble.",
      "But players tend not to glance at the most recent league table before making career calls. Caicedo took the most expensive step down in Premier League history and has played a considerable part in pulling Chelsea back up since.",
      "",
      "6) Leny Yoro\nReal Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool were among those linked but it was Manchester United who completed a genuine transfer coup in signing a player former sporting director Dan Ashworth described as “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”.",
      "Some will put that down to money, or more specifically the pressure selling club Lille reportedly applied on Yoro to take the more lucrative Manchester United offer.",
      "But for a Europa League club to capture such a coveted teenager was yet more proof of that unique allure Manchester United still possess. Yoro was seven when they had last won the title and still in nappies for their most recent Champions League crowning, yet Old Trafford still called.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Suarez\nWhile he would win the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Suarez had only graced the competition proper in one season, scoring a solitary goal during the 2010/11 campaign in which Ajax exited at the group stage.",
      "He joined Liverpool later that season and by the time he had finally dragged them to European Cup qualification for the first time in half a decade in 2014, the Uruguayan forewent the fruits of his labour to rock up in Spain.",
      "Liverpool had finished seventh before Suarez joined, then sixth, eighth and seventh with him. But the forward was not tainted by those years of stagnation, scoring more than 50 goals. Among them were his efforts in the Europa League as Suarez netted four times in seven appearances in the 2012/13 season, which ended with him imploring Liverpool “to honour our agreement”, namely:",
      "“Last year I had the opportunity to move to a big European club and I stayed on the understanding that if we failed to qualify for the Champions League the following season I’d be allowed to go.”",
      "The Emirates was smoking to the tune of £1 but Suarez caught fire in 2013/14, rocketing Liverpool to a Premier League title tilt that faded in spectacular fashion for a runners-up medal. He left for Barcelona instead of sticking around long enough for Brendan Rodgers to put him on the bench at the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nFrom his humble beginnings at Ajax in 2002/03 to the understated modesty that helped steer Paris Saint-Germain in 2015/16, Ibrahimovic did not miss a single Champions League campaign. He played at least six games in every season including and between those two quarter-final appearances, failing to score only when Igor Biscan belittled him in 2004/05.",
      "But it was neither injury nor under-performance that snapped that remarkable streak. Ibrahimovic instead vacated his seat at the European top table entirely of his own accord – by joining Manchester United.",
      "Louis van Gaal had sidestepped the first sign of the Pardpocalypse by quelling any Wembley dad dancing in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman also took Manchester United to within goal difference of the Champions League places but that was not enough and so Jose Mourinho was appointed. One of his first moves was to orchestrate the arrival of Ibrahimovic, who proceeded to talk the considerable talk while actually walking the quite brilliant walk.",
      "But the significant knee knack he suffered in the Europa League quarter-final meant he would play only one Champions League game for Manchester United. He holds the record of most different clubs represented in the European Cup at seven, even if his solitary match in the competition for the Red Devils was as a second-half substitute in defeat to Basel.",
      "",
      "3) N’Golo Kante\nA peculiar set of circumstances meant the £30m departure of the midfielder most vital to a Premier League title win for a team that had finished 10th passed by without much consternation or controversy.",
      "Leicester resigned themselves to the idea that Kante would be the first noteworthy cab off the King Power rank and Chelsea duly obliged after Arsenal pulled out of the running over seemingly extortionate agent fees.",
      "Kante thus had to wait until September 2017 for his first taste of the Champions League, missing out on Leicester’s journey to the quarter-final the previous year and instead busying himself winning a consecutive Premier League title. The Frenchman would claim his European Cup by 2021 as man of the match in the final, cementing a legacy of making up for lost time and receiving the ultimate award for what was quite the leap of faith five years previous.",
      "Chelsea were out of European competition completely but still signed the epitome of a Champions League calibre player as Kante called “the opportunity to work with Antonio Conte, a brilliant coach… simply too good to turn down”.",
      "It is unknown if he felt the same way about Frank Lampard.",
      "",
      "2) Angel di Maria\nHe was an ill fit, a ‘complete fanny’, the polar opposite to what his manager sought and emblematic of a period during which the club favoured style over substance in the transfer market. Manchester United made a loss on Di Maria less than a year after his purchase for good reason.",
      "But it was a monumental capture at the time, albeit a flexing of superficial muscles to stroke an ego bruised by one failed post-Sir Alex Ferguson season. Manchester United finished the 2013/14 campaign in seventh and under the caretaker guidance of Ryan Giggs; Di Maria ended it as man of the match in the Champions League final and leading assist provider in La Liga with 18, having scored in a Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona.",
      "The closest he ever got to playing European football for the Red Devils was the trip to lose 2-1 to Swansea in February 2015 before departing for Paris Saint-Germain that August.",
      "",
      "1) Paul Pogba\nThe world-record fee was used as a stick with which critics could relentlessly beat the haircut out of Pogba. His reign as the most expensive footballer ever lasted a solitary year before Neymar made the £89.3m Manchester United paid Juventus look like a Willian Prunier clean sheet bonus. Yet often forgotten is one of the many wrinkles in that deal: the pull of home, Mourinho or infuriating Graeme Souness on a weekly basis persuaded one of the best young players around to abandon a recent Champions League finalist and serial Serie A title winner for whatever state Van Gaal left Old Trafford in.",
      "It was believed at the time that Real Madrid were the favourites – proving one immutable transfer truth – but when Los Blancos withdrew from the race over money, it was time to dust off Stormzy for the unveiling.",
      "From December 2015 to September 2017, Manchester United’s last chapter in their estimable European Cup history was to bring on Nick Powell against Wolfsburg. In between, they spent more on a player than any team ever before. Pogba remains the last player to open the scoring in a winning continental final for the club, putting Ajax to the Europa League sword to ensure Champions League qualification for a club that finished seven points off fourth in his first season.",
      "Pogba had his pick of clubs as a precocious and prodigious 23-year-old; both he and Manchester United might choose differently if given the option again.",
      "READ NEXT: Manchester United above Newcastle, Spurs, Atletico in ranking of transfer allure to new signings",
      "Paul Pogba has reportedly ‘held talks’ with a Champions League club after opening up on the “hell” of a doping ban which kept him out of football for 18 months.",
      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we look at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold is off to Real Madrid. Naturally, we have picked the biggest free transfer departure for each Premier League club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘advancing’ to secure their first summer signing ahead of a major squad overhaul."

The number in brackets next to each player is where they ranked when this list was first compiled in April 2022, which included 45 signings at the time. Any players signed since then have the number from when they were added. Enjoy the drivel.",

      "65) Alexis Sanchez (swap) (45)\nThe Red Devils signed one of the best players in the Premier League on astronomical wages and he seemed to become an incompetent footballer overnight.",

      "",
      "60) Martin Dubravka (£2m loan fee) (41)\nWhen Dubravka joined from Newcastle United, many expected him to feature in the Europa League group stage, but Dubravka only played three cup games before having his loan terminated in January. What a pointless transfer.",

      "49) Dan James (£16m) (24)\nJames was never good enough for Man Utd and was probably only signed as he was seen as Young And Hungry. The best thing to come from his move is that they turned a rare profit when they sold him to Leeds United.",

      "",
      "40) Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£37.8m) (21)\nThe other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",

      "37) Facundo Pellistri (£7.6m) (20)\nThere was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m in the summer.",

      "",
      "34) Joshua Zirkzee (£36.5m) (26)\nZirkzee has had a horrible time of it since moving to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer. Ruben Amorim hung him out to dry with his first-half substitution against Newcastle. He actually bounced back pretty well but it would be very generous to say he looks like he belongs.",
      "",
      "33) Daley Blind (£15.7m) (16)\nBlind was a handy player to have. Versatile, consistent, rarely outstanding. He played over 140 times in four years at Old Trafford and is currently thriving at Girona.",
      "",
      "32) Alex Telles (£13.5m) (14)\nTelles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford. He joined Al Nassr permanently last July and is now playing for Botafogo.",
      "",
      "31) Marouane Fellaini (£29m) (26)\nFellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "30) Anthony Martial (£54m) (12)\nMartial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He joined AEK Athens on a free transfer in September.",
      "",
      "29) Sofyan Amrabat (£8.5m loan fee) (24)\nIf Amrabat played like he did in his last month at Old Trafford all season, he would be a lot higher.",
      "",
      "28) Victor Lindelof (£31.5m) (11)\nAnother expensive centre-half, Lindelof has not been a bad signing. But ‘not bad’ doesn’t really cut the mustard for Manchester United. After all, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. Leaving on a free transfer this summer. He’s so Turkish Super Lig, isn’t he?",
      "",
      "27) Patrick Dorgu (£25m) (NE)\nThe jury is most certainly out on this one.",
      "",
      "26) Manuel Ugarte (£42.3m) (23)\nA signing that looks amazing on paper, Ugarte is not up to speed yet.",
      "",
      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£49.5m) (40)\nWan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "24) Matthijs de Ligt (£38.4m) (24)\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another.",
      "",
      "23) Raphael Varane (£36m) (7)\nVarane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como in the summer and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "22) Sergio Romero (free) (8)\nAs far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "21) Andre Onana (£45.2m) (11)\nUpgrading on David de Gea should have been Ten Hag’s top priority when he took over and it took him a year to realise the Spaniard needed to be replaced. Do not be blinded by his 2022/23 Golden Glove.",
      "We thought Onana would be a big upgrade on De Gea but that’s not been the case. He makes far too many errors and his distribution is shaky, despite that being a compelling reason for ditching DDG for him.",
      "",
      "20) Jonny Evans (free) (38)\nIt is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "19) Leny Yoro (£52m) (12)\nYoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "18) Marcel Sabitzer (loan) (21)\nAs far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "17) Ayden Heaven (£1.5m) (NE)\nHe might already be United’s best centre-half.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Cunha (£62.5m) (NE)\nSurely…surely this can’t go wrong.",
      "",
      "15) Juan Mata (£40m) (15)\nDavid Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "14) Fred (£53m) (10)\nA few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club.",
      "£53m is still pretty bloody steep, mind.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Eriksen (free) (4)\nA lot of us fancied Eriksen to be the bargain of the 2022/23 campaign and his transfer fee – or lack of – is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Will leave for nothing this summer.",
      "",
      "12) Edinson Cavani (free) (9)\nSeventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "11) Amad Diallo (£19m) (19)\nAfter a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was being written off by many (myself included). However, his time with Sunderland was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which is beginning to look like decent value for money…finally.",
      "",
      "10) Lisandro Martinez (£50m) (5)\nMartinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. The Argentine World Cup winner attracted interest from Arsenal before joining the Red Devils and it is clear to see why. His return from injury at the end of 2023/24 helped Ten Hag win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (£32m) (6)\nHerrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "8) Noussair Mazraoui (£12.8m) (17)\nHe is comfortably the best signing Man Utd made last summer.",
      "",
      "7) Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) (4)\nThere’s not a lot to say that has not already been said. £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "6) Casemiro (£61.5m) (3)\nAfter spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was sitting right there willing to slot straight into their midfield.",
      "This is such a weird one now. In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25, he was one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "At this stage, the Red Devils shouldn’t be too bothered about what transfer fee they get; it’s all about getting Casemiro’s monstrous contract off the books. We’re not sure Saudi Arabia are even that stupid.",
      "",
      "5) Luke Shaw (£33.7m) (3)\nFitness issues and injuries have been the bane of Shaw’s Manchester United career.",
      "",
      "4) Diogo Dalot (£19.8m) (13)\nDalot’s time at the club looked up in the summer of 2021 with Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma circling, however, he has since established himself as the club’s first-choice right-back ahead of Wan-Bissaka, before it became the flip of a coin for Ten Hag.",
      "",
      "3) Alejandro Garnacho (£400k) (10)\nWhat a bargain and Man Utd intend to make some lovely profit in the summer.",
      "",
      "2) Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) (2)\nThis is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 63 players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (£56.7m) (1)\nAlthough his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",
      "He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and a rare bit of great business by the Red Devils. It will take a lot to bump him off top spot – especially after he proved his loyalty by snubbing silly Saudi Arabian money to stay.",
      "In which the Mirror do weird things with Bruno Fernandes quotes both ancient and modern, Florian Wirtz is absolutely furious and Mary Earps should be more like Joe Root.",
      "Man Utd are desperate to offload Jadon Sancho this summer and have offered him as part of a swap deal for a West Ham star, according to reports.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Mikael Silvestre has given his verdict on what needs to happen next with Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Jadon Sancho will return to Man Utd this summer after Chelsea paid the £5m penalty to cancel their obligation to buy the winger, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has decided to ‘reject’ Al-Hilal and stay at Old Trafford ahead of next season, according to Fabrizio Romano."

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",

      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal.

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Fernandes was one of the only standout performers in the United side last season. He was the top scorer in the Premier League, where the Red Devils finished 15th, and in all competitions, he was directly involved in 38 goals.",
      "He recently reiterated his commitment to United, but that was put to the test by interest from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, who were willing to pay him a big sum of money to join.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed on June 3 that Fernandes had decided against the move, as he wanted to continue playing at the top level in Europe.",
      "Now, Fernandes has revealed manager Amorim had a big say in his decision.",
      "“There was an opportunity. The [Al Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there,” Fernandes said.",
      "“They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go.",

      "“Al Hilal were very kind. They spoke to my agent. Then I spoke to my wife. She asked: ‘What do you want to do?’ She always supports my decisions.",
      "“It would have been easy to move there. I know the Portuguese players there very well. But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles.",
      "“I can do that, and I still want to. I’m very passionate about football.”",
      "Amorim was adamant about Fernandes’ position at United in March, when there was a suggestion that Real Madrid could look to sign him.",
      "He said: “No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him.”",
      "Indeed, it looks as though Amorim has got his way, with the huge riches at Al Hilal failing. Whether a big European side approaching for Fernandes would have an impact is a different story, but Amorim would clearly be against that.",
      "The midfielder was clearly happy to listen to his boss on this occasion, so United will hope any other approaches are met with the same mindset.",

      "Ex-Arsenal defender Keown understandably isn’t convinced. Former Sporting CP boss Amorim hasn’t had a pre-season or a summer transfer window yet but United’s results do have to speak for themselves to some degree and finishing in the bottom six of the Premier League isn’t going to be anywhere near good enough next season.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "\"Marcus Rashford has to leave Manchester United. That ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club,\" said Neville on The Overlap show, It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "\"With Jadon Sancho, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him,\" Neville said.",

      "Neville also namedropped Alejandro Garnacho and Antony as two names who should also be shown the door after both players have recently publicly expressed that their respective futures at Old Trafford are uncertain. Last month, Antony said he is \"smiling and happy\" since joining Real Betis on loan.",
      "On Antony, Neville said: \"His interview was absolutely spot on. I would imagine he was absolutely going under while at United. He's gone to Spain and is absolutely suited down to the ground with Spanish football.",
      "\"Over there, there is a different tactical awareness, technical ability, which is better suited to him. There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"Antony is perfect for Spain, and United should facilitate him leaving. Best for United, best for the club.\"",
      "After United's defeat to Spurs, Garnacho spoke to the media after the game to express his discontent at not starting the game. \"We'll see what happens,\" said Garnacho regarding his future after a scathing review of his side's performances.",
      "\"If players are taking on the manager, and if players are questioning the manager in public, through social media, the manager has to win, or the manager has to leave,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",
      "\"That type of thing will happen with him, but he'll have to go. That's not me throwing my toys out the pram, saying he has to go, but for the club and for him it's right that he goes.\"",

      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Monday 2 June 2025 07:39, UK",
      "Manchester United have announced an agreement for the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Cunha will become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League - and the club have moved swiftly to seal the transfer on the opening day of the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is set to sign a five-year deal at United with the option for a further year.",
      "Cunha leaves Wolves as a club-record sale after United met his £62.5m release clause, agreeing to a structure of payment over two years. His signing is subject to visa and registration, say United.",
      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Wolves are happy Cunha's move has gone through as quickly as possible. The release clause which was inserted in his new contract in January has protected their position.",
      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",
      "\"There are so many issues he has to deal with, so many player futures up in the air at the moment.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."
