      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is set to debrief with his players on Friday following Thursday night’s disappointing 1-1 draw against West Ham in the Premier League.",
      "The Red Devils initially took the lead in the second half through a well-taken finish from Diogo Dalot inside the box. However, they were unable to hold on and secure all three points, as Soungoutou Magassa struck a late equaliser for the Hammers at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim’s side remain eighth in the standings, level on 22 points with both Liverpool and Brighton. As things stand, they sit just two points off the top four, but that did little to silence accusations that United have regressed in recent games after such a positive run of form - much to the manager’s frustration.",
      "Speaking in his post-match press conference on Thursday, a rather spiky Amorim addressed those claims, while also confirming his plans to debrief the result with his players once the dust has settled. It emerged last season, after a defeat to Brighton in January, that the United boss damaged a television screen in the dressing room during a furious critique of his players, with a more calm and measured approach having been taken ever since.",
      "\"In that regard, I’m almost always consistent,\" Amorim explained to the media on. \"I had one and you know. Brighton last year. I will talk to them tomorrow.\"",
      "The West Ham draw comes on the back of a mixed week of results, in which United were beaten 1-0 at home by Everton, despite the visitors being reduced to 10 men early in the game. However, they bounced back impressively over the weekend to come from behind and beat Crystal Palace away from home.",
      "While Amorim admits his side are far too inconsistent at present, he refused to be drawn on the notion they are regressing after appearing to turn a corner earlier in the campaign. \"It’s not going backwards,” he added.",
      "“The results are going backwards. We had some moments. That can happen. You were talking about when we had that run that team was really perfect and saying we are not that far from being in the perfect moment.",
      "\"We are really inconsistent. But if you look at the goal, 83 minutes, we have a long ball, we have everything under control and we need to do better.\"",
      "United return to action this weekend with a trip to face a struggling Wolves side. The Midlands club are rock bottom of the standings with just two points from their 14 league games so far this term, meaning the Red Devils must use the opportunity to regain ground in the top-four race before tricky tests against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle later in the month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's chances of signing Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba may have improved, as Brighton are reportedly eyeing a potential replacement for the 21-year-old. Any deal could possibly pave the way for the midfielder's big-money exit.",
      "The Cameroon international was rumoured to be on his way to Old Trafford last summer, seen as a key addition to bolster their midfield. However, United did not make a bid for Baleba, having been quoted a fee in excess of £100million.",
      "Instead, Ruben Amorim and his recruitment department focused their resources on strengthening their forward and goalkeeping departments.",
      "This meant that a revamp of the midfield was put on hold for future transfer windows, with several players being identified as targets for upcoming markets.",
      "Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have been mentioned as possible options, while interest in Baleba continues to be reported as a priority for the coming months despite his patchy form this term.",
      "Whether United will table an offer that could prise him away from Brighton - with his valuation believed to be around £100million - remains to be seen. However, Brighton's activity in the market could increase United's chances of securing the midfielder.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Brighton are interested in Aston Villa's Lamare Bogarde as part of a plan to replace Baleba in the near future. That suggests that Brighton could be open to selling Baleba if their valuation is met.",
      "Bogarde, also 21, is said to be valued at over £25m. He has broken into the first team under Unai Emery, despite stiff competition for places.",
      "Bogarde, nephew of former Chelsea and Barcelona player Winston Bogarde, is now set to carve out his own footballing path. Brighton's potential acquisition of the Villa midfielder could pave the way for Baleba's departure in the near future.",
      "The report suggests that the Seagulls could command a fee north of £100m, given the current market rates for a young defensive midfielder with the ability to disrupt play and control the game.",
      "This development could be timely for United, especially with Casemiro's contract due to expire in 2026 and uncertainty surrounding the futures of Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "He said: \"Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they? But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure. Adam Wharton is a really good player, but can he get around the pitch. Old Trafford is a big pitch, you need to have some physicality.",
      "\"I'd say going off the England form, which has surprised me more than anything, but Elliot Anderson. I really liked him at Newcastle but thought he was more of an attacking player, but he's come into as a No.8 for England and looked very accomplished.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days. I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.\"",

      "The Red Devils squandered their lead and had to settle for a share of the points against the relegation-threatened side. Diogo Dalot's opener was as good as it got for the hosts with their head coach attempting to make changes to press home their advantage and see the game out.",
      "Amorim haad used all five of his substitutions by full-time - Leny Yoro replaced Ayden Heaven at half time, Dalot was brought off for Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount were brought on at the same time to replace Matheus Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee. In injury time Luke Shaw with Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Mainoo has not started a game since the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August and has now been an unused substitute for the fourth time in the Premier League this season.",
      "The United boss was quizzed on whether he would change his subs if he had his time again and replied: \"No, we are losing because of the second balls, sometimes it’s not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offence? Who? Who would be more offensive?\"",
      "Mainoo’s name was suggested, but Amorim laughed and replied: \"Yes, it was the second ball and I was worried with Matheus, I know Bruno [Fernandes] reached the box really well, Mason Mount is playing in his position, they were trying to push us, Bryan [Mbeumo] has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one transition, so that was my idea.\"",
      "There has been talk of Mainoo leaving Manchester despite him enjoying a sensational start to his career. He was a huge hit under Erik ten Hag but his stock has fallen since Amorim arrived into the dugout.",
      "There is talk of a loan exit for Mainoo with the likes of Napoli linked with the midfielder, who previously started in the Euro 2024 final for England. Amorim has continued to field questions on the academy graduate, but has often referred to him in a team context.",
      "\"You talk a lot of about Kobbie,\" he said. \"I have more players in my squad that want to be in the World Cup, so it's a little bit unfair. I put Kobbie [in on Monday] because he's really good near the box, to have a guy like Bruno and him, they can find spaces near the box and score goals. So that was my idea. So, I will use Kobbie and the rest of them to try for the team to win. So, I'm not just focused on one individual.\"",

      "Inconsistency has plagued Manchester United's season so far. The Red Devils have suffered damaging results that piled the pressure on Ruben Amorim but also earned victories that signified progress under the Portuguese boss, namely their 2-1 victory at Liverpool.",
      "The month of December is always a hectic one in English football, and it's a period that can make or break a club's season. Given United are only in two competitions this season, with the FA Cup third round commencing next month, the Premier League is of even more importance than usual.",
      "Inconsistency is one word that paints United's season so far. After earning just two wins in their first six league games, the Red Devils then enjoyed a three-match winning streak, including an impressive away win at Liverpool.",
      "But then came a three-match run without a win, including an embarrassing 1-0 home defeat by Everton, who played much of the game with 10 men. Morale then was boosted by their 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace, and it's the topsy-turvy nature of their results that leaves ex-Tottenham Hotspur and Portugal midfielder Pedro Mendes convinced uncertainty exists within the United changing room.",
      "Speaking to BoyleSports, the 46-year-old said: \"Manchester United will get back into the Champions League, but they are difficult to understand. How can you go for three, four wins in a row, playing really well, and then lose at home against Everton? You know, it's just another setback.",
      "\"When you think the confidence is building and everyone is getting up there and knows what it takes, and then they go away and win against Crystal Palace, which was a more difficult game than Everton at home.",
      "\"So that's the uncertainty also that's around the United dressing room that harms their confidence. But I honestly think that United have the quality and the players to finish top five and get in the Champions League for next year.\"",
      "The Red Devils skipper is traditionally an attacking midfielder but has been playing deeper in Amorim's system, with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount all ahead of him.",
      "Fernandes, 30, has been a regular scorer at United since arriving and has 100 goals in 304 games for the club. But, with his role placing him further away from the goal, his numbers have struggled, with just two league goals to his name in 13 games this season.",
      "Mendes believes Fernandes wants to play further forward and has urged Amorim to find a solution so his talisman can get back to doing what he does best. \"When Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, with Morten Hjulmand or Manuel Ugarte before, and Pedro Goncalves was in the middle,\" Mendes explained.",
      "\"So, someone holding and someone just to take the ball and make the team play. I think at Man United, you have Casemiro, you have Ugarte, you need someone different and Bruno can give that to the team. For sure Bruno would love to play more upfront to score more goals but then you have good players upfront.",
      "\"You have Matheus Cunha, you have Benjamin Sesko, you have Joshua Zirkzee, you have good players upfront, so Bruno can have more presence and more importance in the team at this stage playing that middle role.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has had plenty of set-piece disasters to analyse with his staff over the time he has been at Old Trafford, but this one was a belter.",
      "It was Soungoutou Magassa who finished calmly to give West Ham United a deserved share of the spoils, but the chance came after Noussair Mazraoui had been forced to make a goal-line clearance because a visiting player had towered above the home defence to power in a header from a corner.",
      "And that player? The colossus that is Jarrod Bowen.",
      "Amorim’s team - and Amorim’s defence - really do keep finding new ways of tossing away winning opportunities. Not that this was an overall performance that merited a victory. It was a performance that was sluggish from the outset.",
      "Young Ayden Heaven set the tone, collecting a yellow card for a woefully mistimed slide towards Bowen and then giving a fiendishly fierce back-pass to Senne Lammens, who duly sliced it out of bounds.",
      "But Heaven’s hesitancy was typical of Manchester United’s early efforts. Their lack of intensity was hard to fathom, and a quarter of the match had elapsed before the home side forced their first corner.",
      "That sparked a brief spell of pressure which featured a Joshua Zirkzee effort being cleared off the line by Aaron Wan-Bissaka, but Nuno Espirito Santo’s team rarely looked in any danger in a first half when the most animated aspect of the home performance was Bruno Fernandes’ ongoing beef with referee Andrew Kitchen, taking charge of a Manchester United match for the first time.",
      "There was no danger of Kitchen being unable to keep up with play - it was strictly pedestrian stuff. And that suited West Ham, who, in Bowen, had the game’s most accomplished player.",
      "But this is a West Ham line-up that looks short of confidence, and there was a sense that Ruben Amorim’s men only had to step up a gear to get some joy out of the night. They ended the first half relatively strongly, which made a laborious opening to the second period even more surprising.",
      "There has been quite a lot of talk this season about the general standard of Premier League football and it is fair to say this was pretty grim evidence that it is most definitely not at a vintage level. It was untidy, it was dotted with clumsy fouls, scarred with some seriously poor passing.",
      "That Manchester United have a very realistic chance of finishing in a top-four position is a bit of an indictment of the overall quality of the competition. They did not deserve to win this contest but Diogo Dalot deserved to score his first Premier League goal at Old Trafford and his first Premier League goal anywhere in 18 months.",
      "His smart turn and finish came just before the hour mark after a miscued Casemiro shot had landed at his feet just inside the penalty area. That should have been the platform for a Manchester United win, but West Ham showed great resolve and no little creativity and carved out a couple of half-chances before Magassa’s composure earned them a valuable point.",
      "There were a smattering of jeers after the full-time whistle but, like Manchester United’s attempts to avoid another disappointing finale to a game, they were strictly half-hearted.",

      "\"We had a big opportunity with Cunha. We had the ball near the box but the crosses were not good. Sometimes the players' characteristics inside the box are not good. They are not enough to score goals from that position.\"",
      "United will be aiming to get back to winning ways on Monday evening as they travel to struggling Wolves. Amorim has demanded his side to get back on track to ensure they do not lose any more ground on the top four.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane reckons the Red Devils were 'frightened' to earn victory against West Ham. Ruben Amorim's side could only earn a draw at home despite opening the scoring, and Keane believes they are not 'nasty' enough.",
      "United gave up a 1-0 lead at Old Trafford after Diogo Dalot opened the scoring in a lacklustre match. The Irons fought their way back into the game, and Noussair Mazraoui's goal-line block from Jarrod Bowen's header proved to be in vain as Soungoutou Magassa slotted in the rebound after 83 minutes.",
      "United once again missed the chance to move up to the upper echelons of the table. Like in defeat to Everton, Amorim's men dropped points when they could have moved into fifth position.",
      "The players were booed upon the full-time whistle, with the crowd at the Theatre of Dreams seemingly as irked as club icon Keane. The Irishman could not contain his frustration at the end of the match, criticising the team's lack of ambition to extend their advantage.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappointing. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"We are talking about fifth here by the way. Same old problems.\"",
      "Keane was frustrated with the lack of intensity present in the squad to go and claim a win. \"United are making substitutions, and he is entitled to do that, but I was watching people come off and it was like they had won the league!\" he added.",
      "\"Show some intensity. It was all a bit, 'this is cool'. You cannot be cool when you're 1-0 up. Get the job done!",
      "\"United have better players than West Ham but this is not a good United team. It was too relaxed, get the job done!\"",
      "United settle into eighth in the Premier League, while West Ham fail to break out of the relegation zone after Leeds' win. A crucial point in their battle, nevertheless.",
      "Pundit Gary Neville was impressed by their goalscorer. \"Magassa has been all action - all around the pitch,\" he said. \"Plenty of tackles. He's been a destroyer out there and he's gone and got a goal. He rescued West Ham a vital point.\"",

      "Manchester United failed to make it back-to-back Premier League wins after a late sucker punch from West Ham at Old Trafford",
      "After beating Crystal Palace last time out, United were aiming to secure consecutive victories and with it move towards the Champions League places. And it looked as though a win was exactly what they were going to get as Diogo Dalot's first Premier League goal in a year-and-a-half opened the scoring.",
      "West Ham were not to be denied though as Soungoutou Magassa scored late on to ensure a share of the spoils.",
      "The draw sees Ruben Amorim's side move up to eighth ahead of next Monday's clash with struggling Wolves. In the meantime, West Ham remain in the relegation zone after just one defeat in their last five games.",
      "Here are all of the talking points from Old Trafford:",
      "After injuries to Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, Ruben Amorim was forced to name a somewhat patched up backline that included Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui in central positions alongside youngster Ayden Heaven. And the former Arsenal man appeared to struggle getting to grips with the game.",
      "He was spun on a few occasions by Callum Wilson and picked up an early yellow card. That forced Amorim into action at half-time with Leny Yoro introduced in place of Heaven.",
      "Man United were well aware of Aaron Wan-Bissaka's defensive abilities when they agreed to let him join the Hammers. And they were on show at Old Trafford to deny the Red Devils' biggest chance of the first half.",
      "Amad skipped past El Hadji Malick Diouf and produced a teasing cross towards Zirkzee. After scoring against Crystal Palace, the Dutchman did well to get his body on the ball and divert it towards goal, only to find Wan-Bissaka on the goalline.",
      "The defender proved to be a stubborn opponent throughout the game. United might have felt he should have been dismissed for two yellow cards but it was still an impressive showing nevertheless.",
      "With Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo back for the Red Devils, some might have thought that their opening goal of the game would come through either of the pair. But it came from a very unlikely source - Diogo Dalot.",
      "After West Ham failed to clear the ball, it fell to the Portuguese defender. He took a moment to compose himself before finishing coolly. It was the 26-year-old's first Premier League goal since May 2024, not that anyone would have known given the cultured nature of his finish.",
      "While it was not the result that the Red Devils will have wanted, there were still a few impressive performances - chief among them coming from Casemiro. It was another brilliant performance from the Brazilian in what has been an impressive season.",
      "The midfielder made three tackles, provided an interception and a clearance apiece and also blocked three shots. Given how close he looked to leaving Old Trafford last season, his turnaround really is impressive.",
      "And if United seal a return to the Champions League, it's not misguided to say that the former Real Madrid star would have been a key part of that.",
      "In honesty, there wasn't too much on quality on show at Old Trafford. Only the goals really stood out.",
      "While Dalot's was a cultured finish, the same could certainly be said of Magassa's equaliser. The ball came towards the 22-year-old after being cleared off the line by Mazraoui.",
      "But he did not panic and converted coolly into the bottom corner. The excitement certainly got to him as he celebrated with gusto, but given it was his first Premier League goal, not many can really begrudge him of that.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt misses Manchester United's clash with West Ham due to a 'small' issue, according to Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils boss believes that the Dutch defender will return in time to face Wolves on Monday night.",
      "Amorim has been forced to call upon teenage defender Ayden Heaven, linked with a loan away in January, for a spot in his backline at Old Trafford on Thursday. Heaven, 19, makes his first league start of 2025/26.",
      "United are already without Harry Maguire due to injury, while Leny Yoro takes a place among the substitutes after a difficult time against Crystal Palace. The Frenchman was comforted following that clash.",
      "The game against Nuno Espirito Santo's side marks the first game that De Ligt has missed all season. The former Juventus and Bayern Munich defender had played every minute of Premier League action and came off the bench in the Carabao Cup tie against Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has admitted it is a difficult loss given the Dutch star's form. The ex-Sporting boss believes it is a good opportunity for Heaven, however.",
      "\"It's hard because, if you see that position, especially this year, it's just Harry [Maguire] and Matta playing those positions,\" Amorim told Premier League Productions.",
      "\"It is a blow. He is playing really really well. But I'm really excited with Ayden [Heaven]. He is working there. I think he has the right characteristics to play there.",
      "\"It is a big opportunity for everyone to see Ayden. For Matta, it is a small thing. I expect to have Matthijs next game [at Molineux].\"",
      "Noussair Mazraoui was also selected alongside Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw, with Amad likely to be playing as a wingback against the Irons. Lisandro Martinez offers an additional defensive presence on the bench.",
      "Amorim spoke about Yoro's place ahead of the game, following his difficulties. It’s really important. I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake and then he struggles,\" he said.",
      "\"He wants to do everything so well. He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",

      "Manchester United star Casemiro is set to pocket £247,000 courtesy of his former club Sao Paulo, after a formal agreement was reached to settle a labour dispute - according to reports from Brazil. The midfielder transferred to Real Madrid from his boyhood club in 2013, but has remained linked with Sao Paulo due to claims of unpaid money.",
      "As per Brazilian outlet UOL, via Sport Witness, the case, which had been active since 2014, is now resolved with £247,000 agreed as the payment to the 33-year-old. This will provide him with a nice financial boost at the end of the year, on top of his substantial weekly wage.",
      "The claim, associated with employment-related payments from his academy days, was understood to be around £290,000, although the final figure is slightly less than that. The case included image-rights charges, match-related earnings, bonuses and holiday entitlements, which are standard contractual extras.",
      "Casemiro will receive the payment on a monthly basis, but he may actually rake in up to £363,000 if Sao Paulo fail to keep up with the payment schedule. They have agreed to these terms, with the regional labour court approving the settlement this week.",
      "Next month, Casemiro will be free to negotiate with clubs outside England as he enters the final six months of his United contract. A transfer away last summer seemed to be inevitable, but the seasoned midfielder stayed put and has repaid Ruben Amorim for his faith.",
      "With United typically playing just once weekly, Casemiro has been delivering exceptional performances, although his stamina may face a stern examination in the coming period.",
      "He featured for the full 90 minutes during the 2-1 triumph against Crystal Palace last weekend, with his game-time now likely to be carefully monitored as Amorim's squad take on West Ham United, Wolves and then Bournemouth across the next 12 days.",
      "Casemiro risks missing one of those fixtures through suspension, however, as he sits on four yellow cards in the Premier League.",
      "After the Bournemouth meeting, Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui will all become unavailable as they depart for AFCON. Despite various injury concerns across the squad, United have suffered defeat in just one of their previous seven Premier League matches, leaving them eighth in the standings.",
      "A win against the Hammers would propel them into fourth place, with every other side having already completed their game-week 14 fixtures.",
      "When questioned - during his press conference - about getting into Champions League qualification places and maintaining that position, Amorim responded: \"I understand the question and if the table is there, if you have the opportunity. one game per week, you need to go for it.",
      "\"But then you look at the table and everyone is like two points behind. Everything can change in one week.",
      "\"Let's focus. I think the best way of doing things, especially with our team, is to focus just on the next game. If we win the next game we will maintain the position at least. That is the main focus.",
      "\"To go in the position of Champions League in the next weeks, yes, it is realistic. The future, I don't know. I want to continue near that position next week. Then the rest we will see.\"",

      "Danny Welbeck is arguably enjoying the finest form of his career, over a decade after making the tough choice to leave Manchester United. The Brighton striker came through United's youth system and racked up 142 senior appearances before moving to Arsenal in 2014.",
      "Welbeck realised a childhood ambition when Sir Alex Ferguson promoted him into the first-team squad as a promising young forward. He collected multiple major trophies during his spell at Old Trafford, including the 2012/13 Premier League title, but his United future became increasingly uncertain following Ferguson's retirement.",
      "During David Moyes' short tenure, Welbeck was frequently deployed out wide and his opportunities became even more limited when Louis van Gaal took charge. On transfer deadline day in 2014, he completed a £16million switch to Arsenal, with the striker later sharing his reasons for leaving United.",
      "\"At the time I was playing on the left-wing a lot and in a 4-4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can't make an impact on the game,\" Welbeck explained. \"I can play it to the best of my ability but that's not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.\"",
      "He added: \"You start to have thoughts but at that time you're still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game - that's just me, I'm not going to change that. But you do start to think about what's best for you.\"",
      "The sting of Welbeck's move from United was made worse by a parting shot from Van Gaal. When asked about the club's choice to offload Welbeck, the United manager said: \"He has played, after [his loan spell at] Sunderland, three seasons at Manchester United but he doesn't have the record of [Robin] Van Persie or [Wayne] Rooney and that is the standard.\"",
      "Determined to silence his critics, Welbeck's ambitions were hampered by recurring fitness issues that stopped him from delivering consistent performances for the Gunners. His five-year spell at Arsenal was followed by a difficult campaign at Watford.",
      "Yet Welbeck has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence since joining Brighton as a free agent in October 2020. He's now notched up more appearances and goals for the Seagulls than at any previous club.",
      "The 35-year-old is currently heading towards another personal best campaign, having finally reached double figures for Premier League goals last season. With an impressive seven goals in 13 league matches, Welbeck appears to be getting better with age, sparking suggestions he could force his way back into the England squad ahead of this summer's World Cup.",
      "Speaking about his goalscoring run, Welbeck told The Argus: \"I'm happier than ever. I think like the main thing for me is the consistency of staying on the pitch and getting a rhythm of playing game after game after game.",
      "\"Unfortunately, throughout my career, I've had some really big injuries that have maybe derailed that, and it's difficult.",
      "\"You have to try and get back into form, you have to try and get back to match fitness and that sort of stuff. But the last couple years have been really good, and I'm feeling really good. Long may it continue.\"",

      "The Sun report that Manchester United have 'ramped up their interest' in Mouzakitis by having representatives in Greece to watch him. Intriguingly, Real Madrid are one of the other clubs who are understood to be keeping tabs on the midfield maestro's development, meaning they got the chance to see his prodigious talents firsthand.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will miss the opportunity to scout one of his midfield transfer targets in action next week when they face Wolves in the Premier League. The position is an area of priority for Jason Wilcox next month after investing over £200milllion elsewhere back in the summer.",
      "United are expected to weigh up their options in January when the transfer window opens. The Reds bolstered their squad with a new goalkeeper, striker and two additional forwards in the previous window, but failed to secure a new central midfielder.",
      "A potential deal for Carlos Baleba fell through after Brighton and Hove Albion's asking price was deemed too steep. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson are also reportedly on United's radar following their standout performances this season.",
      "However, another name has surfaced in recent months - Wolves' Brazilian sensation Joao Gomes. The 24-year-old was previously linked with a move to Old Trafford, prior to United's £50million acquisition of Manuel Ugarte in 2024.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Wolves believe that Gomes' value is higher with the club in the Premier League, rather than as a Championship side if they suffer relegation. Other reports have suggested that the midfielder could command a fee close to £44m.",
      "After their midweek loss to Nottingham Forest, the Wanderers are heading to Old Trafford on Monday in search of their first victory of the season. The match was seen as a chance for Amorim to watch Gomes play live before the transfer window, but that's now off the table.",
      "Gomes received his fifth yellow card on Wednesday night, resulting in a one-match ban. This means Rob Edwards will have to delve into his squad for the journey to Old Trafford, with Marshall Munetsi tipped to step in.",

      "Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson has long held the position that consistency is key when it comes to managerial success. As such, he would likely recommend Liverpool stick with Arne Slot despite a downpour in results at Anfield of late.",
      "A disappointing 1-1 draw at home to Sunderland on Wednesday has left the Merseysiders with only four wins from their last 14 games. And after dazzling English audiences by winning the Premier League title in his debut campaign last term, Slot is now struggling to escape scrutiny.",
      "United legend Ferguson was no stranger to the sensation during his 27 years in charge at Old Trafford. And although he retired in 2013 as arguably the greatest manager in British history, even Ferguson came in for serious questioning at points across that tenure.",
      "The Scot left an all but impossible lead to follow when David Moyes was appointed his immediate United successor. And after his countryman was fired only 11 months into the role, Ferguson called for clubs to show patience with their picks even when pressure is being ramped up.",
      "\"There's no evidence that sacking a manager gives you success,\" said Ferguson in 2015. \"But there is evidence at Manchester United, at Nottingham Forest, at Arsenal that [if] you retain the manager for long periods, you get consistency and you get success.\"",
      "Former rival Arsene Wenger was in charge at Arsenal for almost 22 years and brought the Gunners into the 21st century. The Frenchman won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups in England, but his greatest impact at Arsenal was arguably instilling a culture and style that only comes with time.",
      "Ferguson also referred to Nottingham Forest and Brian Clough's 18-year spell in charge at the City Ground. And it was under Clough's command the club won back-to-back European Cups, attaining huge success in the late 1970s in particular.",
      "Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) proved they made the right pick in appointing Slot as Jurgen Klopp's successor last season. But that instant gratification has been muddied by a torrid couple of months.",
      "That being said, while Manchester United have displayed a habit for fast turnover when it comes to coaching appointments, Liverpool traditionally show a little more faith. Slot is Liverpool's seventh managerial appointment of the 21st century, while the Red Devils have had six since Ferguson departed the club only 12 years ago.",
      "Not only that, but the fact Slot accomplished so much, and was in fact in the running for a quadruple, in his debut season should give him a stay of execution. It's also easy to forget Liverpool initially made a sensational start to the season by winning their first seven games of the campaign.",
      "Bearing that in mind, it may not take many tweaks before the Liverpool of that not-too-distant past is back. And Ferguson's own history serves as proof a little bit of trust can go an awful long way.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been encouraged to push through a deal for Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson after claims he would be a \"special\" addition to the squad. Ruben Amorim is believed to be searching for midfield reinforcements, particularly as Kobbie Mainoo has slipped down the pecking order under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Additionally, Casemiro is in the final 12 months of his Old Trafford deal and is yet to commit his future to the club. United have been strongly linked with a swoop for Forest star Anderson, who has been in impressive form this season.",
      "Manchester City are also reportedly monitoring the 23-year-old midfielder, who under contract at the City Ground until June 2029. Forest are said to be reluctant to part with Anderson during the January window, even if bids approaching £100million arrive.",
      "However, reports suggest potential suitors believe an offer exceeding £80m might be enough to persuade club owner Evangelos Marinakis to reconsider his stance. Former Premier League striker Dean Saunders has now urged United to make their move and pip City to Anderson's signature.",
      "The ex-Wolves and Wrexham boss reckons he could prove instrumental in helping Amorim drive the club forward.",
      "Speaking to BoyleSports, he said: \"Elliot Anderson understands the position. He understands when he should go forward and who he's playing with. He doesn't give the ball away, which is a common trait among the best players I ever played with.",
      "\"They've all got one thing in common - they don't give the ball away and he's one of them. He's getting better. Forest just needs to get a few more wins and get him up the league so he can play without the pressure being on him.",
      "\"Manchester United picked up another win at the weekend, which is keeping the wolves from the door. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, I think they're better than what they had. They've signed three good players there and adding Anderson to it would be special.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has just got to keep surviving. He's just got to keep getting three points when he needs it and giving himself time to work this jigsaw puzzle out.\"",
      "Multiple clubs are reportedly lining up to secure Anderson's signature, with the midfielder earning widespread acclaim for his commanding performances since arriving at Forest just over 12 months ago. Whilst a move back to former club Newcastle has been dismissed due to financial constraints, Liverpool are also believed to be monitoring his situation closely.",
      "Anderson's impressive form has earned him a place in the England squad, with manager Thomas Tuchel singing his praises. The German tactician has hailed Anderson as an \"important\" player for the Three Lions, despite the midfielder having only accumulated six caps to date.",
      "Speaking last month, Tuchel said: \"Anderson is a key player for us at the moment. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League - that's why he is with us and starting for us. He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though.",
      "'He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me. He is an elite player with the right attitude and a lot of talent. He is fulfilling his role in the best way possible so we are very happy with him.\"",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday night. United got back to winning ways in the Premier League against Crystal Palace last weekend but they failed to build on that victory.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "Anger on the touchline",
      "United were on course to claim back-to-back Premier League victories, but they conceded from a corner with just eight minutes remaining.",
      "Carlos Fernandes, United's set-piece coach, stands up on the touchline to oversee every set play, and he angrily reacted to Magassa's goal by storming back to his seat on the bench.",
      "Fernandes looked furious as he returned to his seat. United have majorly improved their threat from attacking set-pieces this season - no team in the league has scored more - but they must improve defensively.",
      "Magassa equalised because he was the most player alert in the box, which will irk Fernandes.",
      "Amorim was happy with Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team last weekend and delivered an improved display at left wing-back after briefly losing his starting role to Patrick Dorgu. Dalot made his 150th appearance in the Premier League at Selhurst Park and followed that milestone by scoring his 10th goal for United.",
      "Casemiro's shot fortuitously made its way to Dalot in the box and he finished well. Once the team celebrations were over, Dalot roared to the Stretford End and pumped his fists.",
      "Amorim made the decision to replace Dalot with Dorgu in the 68th minute, and it was interesting to see Dalot exchange words with his manager as he left the field. The United boss appeared to explain why Dalot had been taken off, and he nodded in approval of his performance.",
      "The gloves came off",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was given the nod to start again after scoring against Crystal Palace last weekend and looked sharp in the first half, linking up intelligently with his teammates around the box.",
      "He had a chance of his own, which was headed wide, but picked up where he left off when play resumed following half-time, combining brilliantly with Bryan Mbeumo to create a chance in front of the Stretford End.",
      "It came to nothing. Zirkzee reacted by removing his gloves, throwing them to the side, which felt like he meant business. Although Zirkzee did not score, his display was pleasing, and he brought gasps from the crowd when he brought the ball down dead with a superb first touch. \"What a touch,\" a fan said near the press box.",
      "The problem is that Zirkzee is not a natural goalscorer, and United might have put the game to bed if he'd scored before he was brought off for Mason Mount in the second half.",
      "Hellish start from Heaven",
      "Ayden Heaven was selected to start his first Premier League game since the final day of last season due to Matthijs de Ligt's absence. The youngster started in the centre of the back three and made a poor start to the game, picking up a yellow card in just the seventh minute for a clumsy tackle.",
      "Callum Wilson has entered the winter of his career but he had the better of Heaven when he picked up the ball. The former England international drove at Heaven at every opportunity.",
      "Heaven almost brought Wilson down in the box with an outstretched leg, which made Amorim react as he sent Leny Yoro to warm up on the byline just 17 minutes into the game.",
      "Yoro warmed up for the rest of the half, which suggested Heaven would be hooked. Then Yoro emerged to warm up during half-time - this time without his jumper - and the change was made by Amorim.",
      "Heaven has been given limited minutes this season and he was, understandably, rusty.",
      "Vivell in the directors' box",
      "Christopher Vivell was spotted in the directors' box. Vivell joined United on a temporary basis last year and was appointed permanently as the director of recruitment in February.",
      "The German slid over in the directors' box, seemingly to look at which scouts and agents were present at the game, and he will be hugely influential again when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Amorim recently confirmed that United could be active in the market, although the club spent £215million (excluding add-ons) in the summer window and funds will be limited in January.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens with Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo. Zirkzee retained his starting role against West Ham, but Mainoo is still yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "Mainoo requested to leave on loan in the final week of the summer window and is expected to do the same next month. Whether such a request is entertained remains to be seen.",

      "If anything sums up Manchester United's inability to plot a smooth course under Ruben Amorim, it is the manner of the goal that denied them a crucial win against West Ham.",
      "A day on from talking up their ability from set-pieces, United were undone by one. The equaliser from an 83rd-minute corner was a reminder that vulnerabilities remain and for all the improvement in the other box, they are still weak in their own. It was a painful blow for a side who looked on course to stick themselves into the Champions League conversation.",
      "There was no anger at the final whistle this time, as there had been against Everton. Instead, it was a resigned silence. None of the players on the pitch slumped to their knees, but they put their hands on their hips and stared at the ground. This wasn't the performance of a team destined for the big time in Europe, but a win had them heading in that direction.",
      "Now they will look on and curse another result that got away, another goal conceded from a corner and another second-half they have failed to win.",
      "This was the one-year anniversary of his first defeat as head coach and they have been regular occurrences since then, 22 all told, including penalty shoot-outs to Fulham and Grimsby.",
      "That this didn't end in another defeat was little consolation for a crestfallen Amorim. There has been the whiff of progress recently, but this team's ability to shoot themselves in the foot - and just about every other part of the body - is crushingly frustrating. To sandwich a win at Crystal Palace with a dismal defeat to 10-man Everton and a draw with a dire West Ham, both at Old Trafford, only reinforces the sense that it is one step forward and one backwards.",
      "United were again slow to get going, showing a lack of intensity in the early stages that is baffling, given their reduced schedule this season. Once again, they allowed a team to get a foothold in a game at Old Trafford.",
      "Ayden Heaven's early woes didn't help. The 19-year-old was starting his first Premier League game of the season and was in the middle of a back three, but his inexperience was preyed on by grizzled veteran Callum Wilson. It didn't take long for Wilson to realise he had the upper hand.",
      "It was Bryan Mbeumo who began to rouse United into life. His short-corner routine with Bruno Fernandes led to a curling shot that forced Alphonse Areola into a fine save. Joshua Zirkzee bundled an effort goalwards that was cleared off the line and Fernandes volleyed a follow-up just off target.",
      "Set-pieces have often been the route to goal this season, but with Matthijs de Ligt joining Harry Maguire and Benjamin Sesko on the sidelines, there was a lack of height against a team who had plenty of it.",
      "That was putting the onus on United to find their ruthless streak as well as their creative streak. They had moments of the latter. Amad's quick feet created Zirkzee's first-half chance and he often looked the most likely to make something happen. Zirkzee's first-time pass into Mbeumo early in the second half deserved a finish.",
      "Instead, Mbeumo was beaten to the ball by Freddie Potts and that seemed to sum up United in front of goal. Zirkzee's link-up play was good, Matheus Cunha was probing, Mbeumo was lively and Amad was direct, but none of them have the killer touch in front of goal.",
      "So it was no surprise that the game was unlocked via a slice of good fortune. Casemiro's long-range shot wasn't going to trouble West Ham, but the deflection spun it into the path of Dalot, unmarked and 10 yards out. He had enough space to take a touch and fire a low finish into the Stretford End net.",
      "United looked to hold what they have and Amorim's defensive subs reflected the nervousness, but having talked up their set-piece ability, they were undone by one instead. Amorim admitted that they still had work to do defensively and West Ham found it too easy to level. Jarrod Bowen's flick-on was brilliantly cleared by Noussair Mazraoui, but Soungoutou Magassa slammed in the rebound.",
      "It was from two corners that Arsenal condemned Amorim to his first defeat a year ago. That another corner proved their Achilles heel against the Hammers summed up a team that just can't kick on.",

      "Here are the United player ratings from Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens: One wayward kick in the first half but was solid aside from that. Didn't have a lot to do but safe hands when Bowen's shot was deflected his way. Nothing he could do to prevent the goal. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Solid on his return to the team. A vital late block and a goalline clearance that deserved more than the rebound going in. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: First Premier League start of the season but he had a half to forget. Callum Wilson played on his lack of experience, he got too tight at times and was booked for a rash tackle on Jarrod Bowen. 4",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended well for the most part and saw plenty of the ball in the second half when United were probing for an opening, but a lack of height at the back was exposed. 6",
      "Amad: Created a chance for Joshua Zirkzee with quick feet and looked like making things happen again. Needs to get the ball high up the pitch to really influence the game. 7",
      "Casemiro: Wasn't great on the ball and didn't bring the composure United needed in their game. Got an assist but more through luck than judgment. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: His range of passing in the first half was good but snatched at two injury-time chances to win the game. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Struggled against Aaron Wan-Bissaka at times in the first half but showed superb composure to take his goal well. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Probably the most likely of the front three to score and forced Alphonse Areola into a good save, but should have done better with a second-half chance. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: Not at his best on his return to the team. The odd nice touch but seemed a little lost in his role and didn't really threaten. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Did well to force Wan-Bissaka into a goalline clearance in the first half and his link-up play was outstanding at times, with one brilliant pass to Mbeumo. 7",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Unconvincing under one early high ball and clearly lacking a bit of confidence at the moment. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: An enterprising run after replacing Dalot and will be pleased with his solid cameo. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Came on to see the game out and failed. 5",
      "Mason Mount: Not much time to make an impression. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Malacia, Mainoo, Lacey",

      "Ruben Amorim said he had no regrets over his second-half substitutes in Manchester United's draw with West Ham despite criticism they had been too negative. After replacing Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro at half-time, he brought Patrick Dorgu on for Diogo Dalot and in a bid to see out the game took off Joshua Zirkzee for Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "With West Ham level in the 83rd minute, the United head coach then took off Luke Shaw for Lisandro Martinez and left Kobbie Mainoo on the bench, despite his team needing a winner. But Amorim said he had made the changes because his team were losing too many second balls and he felt they still had the firepower to score goals.",
      "\"No,\" he said when asked if he would change the replacements. \"We are losing because of the second ball. Sometimes there's not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?",
      "\"It was the second ball. I was worried with Matheus. I know that Bruno has reached the box really well. Mason Mount is playing in his position. They were trying to push us. Bryan has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one position. So that was my idea.\"",
      "Asked how he felt after seeing his side concede a late equaliser that cost them a chance of going fifth in the Premier League, he said he was \"frustrated and angry\", but then rejected claims his team were failing to progress.",
      "\"It’s not going backwards, we had some moments,\" he said. \"That can happen. You were talking about when we had the [good] run we were perfect, we are not, we are really inconsistent.",

      "Ruben Amorim slammed Manchester United's inability to win second balls against West Ham and the way they gifted the visitors a corner which led to their equaliser at Old Trafford.",
      "United took the lead in a scrappy game through Diogo Dalot's goal just before the hour mark and a win would have taken them fifth in the Premier League, but they failed to see the game out as Soungoutou Magassa equalised seven minutes from time.",
      "That goal came from a corner, with Noussair Mazraoui clearing Jarrod Bowen's initial header off the line before Magassa turned in the rebound, but Amorim was more frustrated at the soft concession of the corner.",
      "The Hammers had a clear height advantage against United, who seemed to be under no threat when a long ball was sent into their half, but Leny Yoro failed to win the header and they ended up giving a crucial corner away.",
      "\"Second ball is sometimes a tactical thing, we try to adjust with the players that we put in and then we control.,\" said Amorim. \"In the final minutes we had the possession, the ball was far from the opponent, it was not a clear full press from the opponent.",
      "\"We cannot let a team that is so much taller than us to have a corner when the ball is in the goalkeeper. This kind of detail makes the difference and today a corner in the second half made the difference.\"",
      "It continued United's wretched second-half record in the Premier League this season. The two goals they scored at Crystal Palace at the weekend is the only time they have won a second half this season and Amorim accepts they must improve after the break.",
      "\"There are second halves that we lost control of the game today, I think it was not that case,\" he said. \"Maybe after the first goal we lost some second balls and Matheus won one or two second balls there and made a transition.",
      "\"We tried to defend all the time, far from the goal because we knew it. They tried to make a cross, win a corner. It happened. Long ball, they win a second ball against three guys of us in the defence. So we need to be better in second halves.\"",
      "United's goal came from Casemiro's deflected shot falling kindly for Dalot, but they struggled to create much aside from that. Bryan Mbeumo had a shot turned away by Alphonse Areola and Joshua Zirkzee had an effort cleared off the line by Aaron Wan-Bissaka.",
      "They continue to struggle to create chances from open play and Amorim knows goalscoring is an area that has to improve, given their propensity for failing to see out leads.",
      "\"I always have the feeling that everyone has the feeling that we need to score more goals and nothing is sure,\" he said. \"Even with Brighton, we were 3-0 and then suddenly, so we suffer with that. We are inconsistent, we need to improve.\"",

      "Noussair Mazraoui blasted Manchester United's inconsistency after drawing with West Ham in the Premier League, and he admitted football is regularly becoming \"frustrating\" at Old Trafford. United had the opportunity to climb to fifth in the table against West Ham, and the Reds looked on course to record back-to-back wins in the league.",
      "Diogo Dalot scored at the Stretford End in the 58th minute to break the deadlock, but West Ham salvaged a point thanks to a late goal from midfielder Soungoutou Magassa. Mazraoui was visibly disappointed as he began his post-match interview with MUTV. He was asked, \"Nouss, sometimes football is frustrating, isn't it?\" and responded: \"Yep, it's more than sometimes now.\"",
      "After that blunt response, Mazraoui slammed United's failure to climb up the table due to their inconsistency, saying: \"I think up to the 1-0, we really wanted to win the game and you saw that in everything. We were looking for the goal, a goal came and then we went looking for the second, but it didn't come.",
      "\"Then you see a little drop in energy and that costs you really badly. We know in set-pieces every Premier League team is really strong and if you lose one moment focus, these kind of things happen.",
      "\"It's really frustrating. It's frustrating because we get opportunities to climb the table, that's what we want, to be in a good spot for ourselves, for the club, and we've not been there for a long time now.",
      "\"And we disappoint ourselves, the club and the fans - everyone, basically. We don't make use of these opportunities. They keep coming, but if we don't take them at one point, you're going to struggle a lot.",
      "\"It's hard to find some positives after a draw. It feels like a defeat because you just lost two points here at home for the second time in a row, so it feels really tough.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot believes Manchester United became \"anxious\" once they had found a breakthrough against West Ham and has stressed the team cannot afford to be throwing away points when they are leading at Old Trafford. United looked set for a frustrating evening as they continued to struggle in front of goal, but Dalot's strike just before the hour mark handed them the lead.",
      "The goal looked set to hand Ruben Amorim back-to-back Premier League wins following Sunday's victory over Crystal Palace, but United switched off and Soungoutou Magassa earned his side a late point. The draw meant United once again missed out on the opportunity to move into what will likely be a Champions League spot.",
      "“Disappointed. We need to control much more of the game, especially at Old Trafford,\" he said. \"We cannot get as anxious as we got after the goal. We were maybe more sloppy with the ball possession, so obviously disappointed with the draw. We had the game there.”",
      "Dalot was asked why he feels United are struggling to find consistency this season, saying: “It’s exactly that solution we have to find. It can be various things. It shouldn’t be like this because we’re fighting 60 minutes to score a goal, when it happens you should keep doing the same things; even more control, longer possession so we can have more dominance, especially when we lose the ball so we are in good positions to recover it back.",
      "\"Especially the goal, the play that goes to the corner we concede, that’s the kind of thing we need to avoid, especially against teams that are good on the counter like we knew they would be today. Unfortunately we couldn’t hold the result but we need to look at ourselves. It’s more our fault than credit to West Ham.",
      "“This type of result just gives you something to look at. We cannot be winning at home with 30 minutes to go and not winning the game.”",
      "On the importance of picking up good results over the hectic festive period, Dalot added: “It’s massive. We are in the time of year when you cannot drop too many points or the distance to the top will be even higher.",
      "\"The distances are short this season but it will get to a time where everybody is going to start spreading and we want to be there in the top four or top five, and that’s the aim. We have to be there. Today we had a good chance and I think that’s why the disappointment is bigger.”",

      "The Reds were on course to win back-to-back Premier League games, but Soungoutou Magassa scored in the 82nd minute to salvage a point for his side. West Ham boss Nuno reacted in his press conference, saying: \"I think it was a good performance overall. First half, we contained the momentum, and the beginning of the game was ours.",
      "\"Second half was very good, even though we conceded. I think it is well deserved that we got the draw. The reaction and character was there today. It is a bit of a small step.\"",
      "Nuno was asked whether he was confident West Ham would get a goal to ensure the points were shared and responded: \"I am always positive, and what I was seeing is we were playing good. The boys were in control of the situation. You say a chance came late, but it came.\"",
      "\"We wanted to show a reaction and I think we showed that from going a goal down to getting back into the game. I was really proud of the team tonight. The way they fought, the way they ran, and got a deserved point.",

      "\"We have that belief, I think you can see that, and then we get the goal from a set piece which is really important for us. Sounga got his first goal, delighted for him, he deserves it so much. I'm really happy for him.\"",

      "\"A player who is not scared of stepping up despite the pressure, despite the situation, despite this sort of heaviness that seems to be around United all the time.

      "“Both Mbeumo and Amad are going, and Mazraoui behind them, so its the entire right-hand side going away for at least a month. It could have a real big impact on their season if they’re not prepared, and the manager feels the squad is light in those areas, so something will have to be done.",
      "\"Semenyo is the one they’ve been looking at, because Ghana didn’t qualify for AFCON. It looks like he will be available in January because of that release clause in his contract, that’s why there are a few clubs having a look at him.",
      "\"But United need to spend in January to improve the squad, and he’s somebody they wanted to bring in during the summer before he signed that contract. If the opportunity comes up when the window opens, it would make a lot of sense because he would also be able to plug that hole left by Mbeumo.\"",
      "Brandon Williams' post-Manchester United career could have taken a further blow after Hull City manager Sergej Jakirovic admitted he could leave the club permanently in the January transfer window.",
      "Williams racked up 51 appearances for the United senior team having come through the academy at Carrington. However, his career took a drastic turn two years ago when he was involved in a high speed crash.",
      "In May 2025, the defender was handed a 14-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, a three-year driving ban, and a significant amount of community service at Chester Crown Court. \"It was just a learning process. Things did happen, but like I said, I've learned from them now. I'm growing up now, I'm not a young player no more,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm becoming one of the senior players in the squad as well, so it's important for me to help the young players as well because I know how difficult it is. It was difficult because everyone kind of forgot what I actually achieved; people don't understand that.",
      "\"I didn't even understand at the time what I've actually achieved (playing for Manchester United at such a young age). There are a lot of people in the world who would wish that for their child or something like that. It was upsetting that I've let a lot of people down; it's for me to get things right now.",
      "\"Like, I've always said as well, I don't want any sympathy from anyone. It was my actions; I took responsibility for them. I've apologised, and all I can do now is just focus on my football and get things right on the pitch, and I'm sure that people will appreciate that.\"",
      "Teenage sensation JJ Gabriel has reportedly attracted the interest of Barcelona.",
      "The Spanish giants are said to be working hard to lure Gabriel away from United and bring him into their renowned La Masia academy.",
      "\"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" Ruben Amorim said. \"You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "“Not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "United view him as a versatile, proven-quality addition for the future, especially if they return to European competition. However, the Reds are preparing for a January bid as they are concerned that waiting until the summer could result in them failing to sign him.",
      "Man United have received a huge boost in their pursuit for Conor Gallagher, it has been claimed.",
      "In his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano reported there was a chance Gallagher could depart the Estadio Metropolitano this January.",
      "\"I think there is a chance for Conor Gallagher to leave Atletico Madrid already in the January transfer window or eventually in the summer,\" Romano said. \"This will also depend on the formula of the deal. Manchester United were interested in Conor Gallagher as an opportunity in the final days of August but Atletico said no to a loan move and they don’t have that kind of intention.",
      "\"I think if maybe a permanent transfer proposal arrives, that would be different. Maybe something around 30 million euros (£26m), sources say that this could be the way to get Conor Gallagher in the January transfer window.\"",
      "Manchester United are prepared to compete with Arsenal for the potential transfer of Eintracht Frankfurt's Nathaniel Brown.",
      "According to BILD, there is a significant risk of Frankfurt losing Brown this summer, and the Premier League could be his next destination.",
      "It's suggested that Frankfurt are in a position where they will have to sell the two-time Germany international.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes claim Man United have submitted a £53million bid to sign Newcastle United star Harvey Barnes in January. The winger has scored four goals in his last six Premier League appearances.",

      "Man United are monitoring Atalanta youngster Sergej Levak, according to Calcio Mercato.",
      "The 19-year-old has been likened to Rodri, with a knack for arriving in the box at just the right moment, and is expected to make his first-team debut in the near future.",
      "It's said that United have had a scout tracking his recent games, though a 'number of big clubs' are also watching him.",
      "According to LaRoma24, Roma's management has received approval for the needed budget to secure a high-level striker, and Joshua Zirkzee is mentioned as one the Italian club want.",
      "It's said that Roma's ownership will guarantee financial coverage for the deal, whether it is a loan or a permanent transfer. Zirkzee, however, could still stay at United in January.",
      "Antoine Semenyo REJECTED an offer from Manchester United in the summer, it has been reported. The Reds wanted to sign the Bournemouth winger but he turned down the chance to move to Old Trafford.",
      "He instead remain at the Vitality Stadium, though United still remain interest and are tempted to re-ignite a potential move for Semenyo during the January transfer window.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta is said to be of interest to Manchester United again, according to journalist Alan Nixon, with the Crystal Palace forward refusing to sign a new contract at Selhurst Park.",

      "It's said there is a good chance United sign Mateta with Palace eyeing up Manchester City's Divin Mubama, who is on loan at Stoke City, as a replacement for the France international.",
      "According to a latest report from Tuttomercato in Italy, Napoli's 'most likely option' is to sign Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United. Antonio Conte's side want to negotiate a loan with an option to buy the England international, who has struggled for game time at Old Trafford this season.",
      "Mainoo has indicated he is available, though the situation is expected to be become clearer in two weeks ahead of the January transfer window opening.",
      "According to The Athletic, Manchester United 'agreed personal terms' with Carlos Baleba in the summer, though the Reds did eventually opt against making a bid for the Brighton midfielder.",
      "As was the case then, this is not a deal that will come cheap for the 13-time Premier League champions, should United attempt to come back in for him during the January transfer window.",
      "Indeed, Brighton wanted at least £100million for the Cameroon international, who is also attracting interest from Tottenham, and the Seagulls are expected to demand the same amount now.",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 against West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday.",
      "The Reds produced their most disappointing display of the season against Everton in their first game back after the international break, losing 1-0 at Old Trafford despite the visitors playing much of the game with 10 men.",
      "Crystal Palace was an opportunity to bounce back from that defeat and Ruben Amorim's men did just that, putting a poor first-half display behind them to win 2-1 thanks to goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount.",
      "But United were unable to build on that performance, drawing against West Ham.",
      "Recap what happened at Old Trafford here.",
      "If anything sums up Manchester United's inability to plot a smooth course under Ruben Amorim, it is the manner of the goal that denied them a crucial win against West Ham.",
      "A day on from talking up their ability from set-pieces, United were undone by one. The equaliser from an 83rd-minute corner was a reminder that vulnerabilities remain and for all the improvement in the other box, they are still weak in their own. It was a painful blow for a side who looked on course to stick themselves into the Champions League conversation.",
      "There was no anger at the final whistle this time, as there had been against Everton. Instead, it was a resigned silence.

This wasn't the performance of a team destined for the big time in Europe, but a win had them heading in that direction.",

      "Noussair Mazraoui: Solid on his return to the team. A vital late block and a goalline clearance that deserved more than the rebound going in. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: First Premier League start of the season but he had a half to forget. Callum Wilson played on his lack of experience, he got too tight at times and was booked for a rash tackle on Jarrod Bowen. 4",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended well for the most part and saw plenty of the ball in the second half when United were probing for an opening, but a lack of height at the back was exposed. 6",

      "Fernandes just sent another cross to the back post but West Ham cleared ahead of Zirkzee.",
      "Heaven was all over Wilson just there and might have been lucky to get away with it. Amorim will be tempted to take him off. United just came close to scoring, with Wan-Bissaka denying Zirkzee from the goal-line.",
      "Set-pieces could be vital again tonight for United but they do lack a bit of height to attack then, especially against a big West Ham team. That corner showed there is more than one way to skin a cat. Mbeumo worked a shooting position from his own corner and his effort was an excellent one. First sight of goal United have had and it needs to get them going, because this has been a poor start.",
      "Great save from Areola to deny Mbeumo from the edge of the box.",
      "Fernandes played a hopeful ball in the box but Zirkzee wasn't close enough to connect.",
      "Yoro has been sent to warm up already, which tells you how Heaven has started this game.",
      "Wilson just had Heaven on toast there and the yougster came close to bringing him down with an outstretched leg.",
      "Heaven got turned a little too easily by Wilson on halfway in the first couple of minutes of this game and he’s been dragged up the pitch by Bowen on a couple of occasions. A big task for him to play that central role in the back three today and West Ham look to be trying to play on a lack of experience. That was a crude tackle and being on a yellow card for more than 80 minutes isn’t ideal.",
      "Heaven has made a nervous start to the game and was just booked for a clumsy tackle.",
      "Wan-Bissaka ran past a few United players to get into a dangerous area then and West Ham should have made more of that chance. He was running at speed but there was a lack of appetite and focus to go with him. He flew past Casemiro, he didn’t seem attuned to the threat he was posing. West Ham worked a couple of promising attacks so far and been some signs of some good link-up play.",
      "Dalot was superb from the left last weekend and was just involved in some decent link up play with Zirkzee. Amorim spoke about needing more from Dalot going forward on that side. It seems he got the message.",
      "Mbeumo just picked the ball up in a central area and beat his man. He drifted in from the right in the second half last weekend and it was quite effective. Amad just went down in the box but it was not a penalty."

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is at a crossroads in his career, and the next two transfer windows could prove crucial for the young midfielder.",
      "The academy graduate enjoyed a remarkable rise at Old Trafford following his breakthrough into the first team a couple of years ago. After an injury-ravaged start to the 2023/24 campaign, Mainoo eventually forced his way into the starting line-up under Erik ten Hag and made 24 Premier League appearances that season, most of them starts.",
      "Last term, injuries again disrupted his season, yet he still amassed over 30 appearances across all competitions, despite a managerial change midway through the campaign as Ruben Amorim replaced Ten Hag in the dugout. However, after being linked with a move away towards the end of the summer transfer window, this season has looked markedly different for the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo has made just one start so far this season, in a Carabao Cup second-round tie against Grimsby Town at the end of August - a game Amorim's side went on to lose on penalties after a 2-2 draw in normal time.",
      "The England international has featured in nine of United's 14 Premier League matches so far, but all of those appearances have come from the bench. He was most recently an unused substitute in the 1-1 draw at home to West Ham on Thursday evening.",
      "Only four senior members of United’s squad are yet to start a Premier League match this season: Tom Heaton, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and, most concerningly, Mainoo.",
      "For the majority of that list, being resigned to the bench is neither surprising nor concerning. Heaton is a third-choice goalkeeper, Malacia had been linked with a move away in the summer and was a member of the so-called 'bomb squad' with the likes of Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford as they sought moves away, while Martinez has only recently returned from almost an entire year out with a knee injury. For Mainoo, there is no such explanation.",
      "Therefore, it is no surprise to see rumours of a move away re-emerge as the January window approaches. Mainoo had been linked with Napoli in the summer, where teammate Rasmus Hojlund headed on loan during the same period.",
      "The reality for Mainoo is that his current predicament at United looks unlikely to change any time soon, with Amorim simply preferring other options. The club also continue to be linked with midfield reinforcements after a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba failed to materialise in the summer, which would push Mainoo even further down the pecking order.",
      "In a World Cup year, time is of the essence, and Mainoo is running out of opportunities to force his way back into Thomas Tuchel’s plans. After earning his first senior England call-up in spring last year, the midfielder has not been named in a Three Lions squad at any point this calendar year.",
      "The England boss was asked about Mainoo’s chances earlier this season, but unsurprisingly cited a lack of game time as the key reason behind his recent omissions. \"He's lacking minutes,\" Tuchel explained in a press conference.",
      "\"I don't think he lacks anything else. He has the experience, the power, the quality, the talent to be on our list - he is on our list - but in his position No6, No8, No10 we have players in full rhythm and play key parts in their clubs.\"",
      "After his early United career promised so much, it is a shame that another of the club's academy graduates may need to leave in order to reignite his career. Despite still being relatively young, it is clear Mainoo has a major decision to make over his future in the coming weeks, but he cannot afford to continue being overlooked and ignored.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "I don’t watch TV when they are talking about Manchester United. Not because I don’t agree, a lot of time I do, but it’s a way of me being healthy.",
      "My feeling as a coach is enough, I don’t need other feelings. The only way is protect myself. Of course I lose money from sponsors on Instagram, for my protection of my family and living a normal life is not worth some pounds.",
      "I protect myself and nobody can tough me more than me when we lose and when we don’t play well. Nowadays it’s really normal to have that abuse so it’s the only way to survive.",

      "Yoro conceded the penalty which allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta to open the scoring at Selhurst Park, before goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount saw United side roar back in the second half.",
      "Amorim took Yoro off during the celebrations for the equaliser, with Noussair Mazraoui already stripped and ready to come on. The 20-year-old showed his frustration as he was withdrawn and needed an arm around the shoulder from Mason Mount at full-time.",
      "That gesture was praised by Amorim, who revealed he had spoken to Yoro about his reaction to mistakes and also used this week to show him clips of positive elements from his performance at Selhurst Park to try and rebuild his confidence.",

      "The preparation is about the opponent but I’m focused on what we need to do and what we need to improve.",
      "He can do a lot of things better, like other players. When you see a very good game of Diogo he can show he has the quality, but sometimes he drops a little bit.",
      "He’s really powerful, he’s good on set-pieces, he can play both sides. To have that ability of playing both sides that can help you to think about the squad. He’s a very important player for us but he needs to improve like another player.",

      "United host West Ham United on Thursday night (8pm kick-off) and they go into the game in good spirits. Despite being 1-0 down at half-time, Ruben Amorim’s side came out as 2-1 winners against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The game against West Ham will now give the team chance to gain momentum and record back-to-back wins. United captain Bruno Fernandes had given United a slight injury scare in the closing stages of the game against Palace, but Amorim has confirmed that he had just been on the end of a kick and should be fine.",
      "The side have also been given another boost ahead of the clash against the Hammers with forward Matheus Cunha providing an update on his injury. Here’s a look at the latest from the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "This week presents a relatively unique experience for Manchester United, who for the first time since the end of August have a midweek game and a short turnaround between fixtures. The embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby further cleared an already quiet schedule for a team not in Europe this year, and United have benefited from the lack of midweek games to drill down into Ruben Amorim's plans on the training pitches at Carrington.",
      "They have played only 14 games this season, compared to the 20 contested by Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle. A gap of just four days between Sunday's win at Crystal Palace and Thursday's Old Trafford date with West Ham is unusual for a team that has become accustomed to the pattern of long lead-ins to games. They have had at least six days to prepare for every match since the start of September.",

      "The 30-year-old has started every Premier League game this season and has developed into a senior statesman in this squad. He was presented with the shirt by director of football Jason Wilcox and head coach Ruben Amorim, before delivering a speech to the squad and first-team staff. That is something Amorim has introduced this season.",

      "Manchester United are confident of keeping hold of JJ Gabriel despite Barcelona stepping up their efforts to sign the academy starlet. The 15-year-old and his family have been guests of Barcelona at the Nou Camp on at least one occasion recently and were given a tour of the facilities as the Catalan club try and woo the United teenager.",
      "Their interest in Gabriel is long-standing. Gabriel has met Barcelona players during his visits to the Spanish city and it has been made clear that the club would like to bring him to their iconic La Masia academy at some point in the future. The England Under-16 international has long been talked about as one of the best talents to emerge from the United academy in recent seasons, but his goalscoring exploits for the Under-18s have seen him enter the wider consciousness this season.",

      "Carrington insiders talk of how easy every player is to deal with and there has been a collective approach to things like media duties and community appearances this season. It may not be a coincidence that naturally quieter players, such as Shaw and Mason Mount, have found their voice. Shaw has helped Matheus Cunha settle in and has struck up a friendship with the Brazilian, while Mount is now bringing his experience to bear on the squad.",
      "It was noticeable that Sunday's matchwinner wrapped an arm around Leny Yoro at Selhurst Park on Sunday and Mount, having shunned media duties in his first couple of years at the club, has become an excellent talker off the pitch.",
      "The dressing room now feels a more level, meritocratic place. Some notable figures and personalities have left the club in recent years. Players such as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could bring the mood down and dominant personalities like Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo have gone.",
      "Despite the frequent turnover of managers in recent years at United, it is the players who have often faced scrutiny from supporters. That feels like it's changing this season and even if there are questions around the quality of some players, the idea that the dressing room is toxic or plotting behind the back of the manager has gone.",
      "That might be Amorim's biggest success so far. There are signs of progress on the pitch, but off it he has changed the culture and the environment at Carrington, which has been absolutely vital. He has been especially ruthless with players whom he considered to be a bad influence or who affected the mood of the dressing room, axing Rashford, Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho as a result.",
      "The benefits of that approach are now being seen. This feels like a squad on the same page and willing to stick together and that hasn't always been the case for Amorim's predecessors.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

But right now, the pressure is mounting on Ruben Amorim. If he doesn’t secure three points against Wolves on Monday night, we could be in for a bloodbath.

      "Good to see Chelsea bought down to earth by Leeds. Chelsea seemed sterile without Caicedo but that takes nothing away from the good performance by Leeds. They are looking good and put in a good account of themselves against City.",
      "Now Aston Villa away. Why, after feeling relieved to get games against certain title challengers off the list, we come up against a new contender in good form. All this talk about Arsenal being dead certs for the title is wrong. If that was the case, with a record so far of ten wins, three draws and only one defeat, Arsenal would be further ahead than they currently are.\nChris, Croydon",
      "",
      "Why is it that when the league is bunched up, or when teams outside the traditional “big 6/7” (or whatever we’re calling them now) do well, people suggest the league is weak? Monty in the mailbox falls foul of this when he proclaims, “It’s wild that we could win at Leeds and go fourth; a real reflection of how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season”. I put it to the jury, it’s actually a reflection of how incredibly strong the standard of the league is now.",
      "This is reflected in how tricky games have become against any team in the league, with the exception of Wolves (and Liverpool – titter) who have looked poor up until now (cue them taking points off us on Monday) but even they drew with Spurs and Brighton. It’s not just that my team are consistently inconsistent, I look at the fixture list now and can barely come up for air! Any team on their day will give you a game. Just look at how well the promoted teams can hold their own. Even Burnley – are you confident of your team going to Turf Moor and getting 3 points? Because I sure as shit am not!",
      "Oh you want some evidence and not just anecdotal ramblings of a mad man, you bunch of pedants? Look at how well English teams have been doing in Europe recently. Last season all 4 made it out of the group stages in the CL, with Arsenal and Villa going relatively deep. Spurs and Utd reached the final of the EL (can’t remember who won), and Chelsea breezed through the EC and won it. This season, Arsenal are flying in the CL with the other 4 teams in with a strong chance of qualifying; the same for the teams in the lesser comps (although Palace could be doing better to be fair).",
      "So why is this? Well there is obviously the money. Contrary to what slippery Puffy might have opined, mo money does not equal mo problems in football. Mo money in fact equals better players. However, something that has been nagging at me for years is that the main influence on the league is actually the standard of manager (or coaches) and the evolution of tactics.",
      "I’m not sure how to easily prove or disprove this theory, and maybe the better players and better coaches go hand in hand, like the old nature vs nurture conundrum. Or did the better coaches follow the better players or vice versa, like the old chicken and egg conundrum. But the influx of better coaches (typically foreign – they took our jobs Randy!) and ideas has really ramped up the standard of the league, and improved domestic coaching too.",
      "If there’s an Econometrics student out there looking for an idea for a dissertation, feel free to run a regression model on all of this and write in with the results. Otherwise, you’ll all just have to take my word for it. And when have I ever been wrong, right guys? Guys? Guys?!\nGarey Vance, MUFC",
      "",
      "…In his mail, Monty, LFC wrote that the standard of the Premier League this year is “incredibly low”. This got me thinking. What is the right way to measure the quality of the League? One approach that I can think of is to look at the average points per game so far this season of the teams that finished in the top 6 last season, and compared them to their average points per game over the whole of last season. Here is what I found:",
      "Liverpool (last season = 2.21 / this season = 1.57)\nArsenal (1.95 / 2.36)\nMan City (1.87 / 2.00)\nChelsea (1.82 / 1.71)\nNewcastle (1.74 / 1.36)\nVilla (1.74 / 1.93)",
      "And for good measure, I am going to add Man Utd. and Spurs because they are in the original Big 6.",
      "Man Utd (1.11 / 1.62)\nSpurs (1.00 / 1.36)",
      "Out of these 8 teams (who, in recent seasons, regularly competed for Champions’ League spots), Liverpool, Newcastle, and Chelsea are averaging fewer points per game this season. So, this measure, while inconclusive, does not really indicate that the League is weaker this season. What are other measures that people can suggest?\nNick",
      "",
      "…Ah Monty LFC in this morning’s mailbox wins the bitter fan bingo.",
      "‘….this shows how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season’",
      "Translation: my team is playing badly and can’t beat teams I consider weak or midtable so I’ll say it’s a low standard season.",
      "The alternative opposite view is the league is more competitive than it’s ever been. Currently there’s only 3 genuinely weak teams, but if you’re slightly off it against anyone else particularly away from home you’re liable to get turned over no matter who you are and no matter what perch you’ve toppled off.",
      "In Liverpool’s case the alternative view is also that they are incredibly lucky that so many good sides are taking points off each other to enable Liverpool to stay 1 win away from the Champions League places, as they certainly don’t deserve to be that close based on performances this season. Just think where Liverpool would be if they got the results their performances deserved in the first 5 games of the season!\nRich, AFC",
      "",
      "Now, you probably don’t get many emails about refs in the mailbox, but wanted to shout out Darren England for Wednesday night’s performance.",
      "He really didn’t put a foot wrong and rose to the occasion by not blowing up for every perceived infraction, and he did not cave into Chelsea’s ugly histrionics, badgering and gamesmanship.",
      "Chalobah milking a head injury – made him go off the pitch. Estevao’s petulance rightly leading to a booking. Sanchez’ awful goalkeeping costing them a goal – never in a million years was England going to rule out. Enzo Fernandez’ and Cucurella’s constant moaning ignored. Full blooded challenges where players got the ball and some of the man – play on.",

      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places, but they’re not going to finish in the top five of the Premier League if they don’t a) make some signings in January and b) win more than one game in a row.",
      "Will their finances allow a big spending spree in the winter transfer window? Probably not. Are we going to create a scenario where Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos spend around £250million? Yes. Absolutely.",
      "These five transfers would make for a perfect January for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, with a Liverpool hijack, Vinicius Junior and Mason Greenwood all thrown into the equation.",
      "",
      "It’s obvious that Manchester United need and want to sign a new central midfielder. The question is: who?",
      "If this was Career Mode or Football Manager, it would be one or two of Federico Valverde, Sandro Tonali, Declan Rice, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong or Moises Caicedo. But this is the real world. And in the real world, it’s going to be Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton. Which is still absolutely fine, by the way.",
      "Ruben Amorim is never shifting from his beloved 3-4-2-1 formation, so looking at previously successful English clubs operating in the same way, the Red Devils need a player like Nemanja Matic, N’Golo Kante or Jorginho. So it really isn’t all that simple. The best option, that also happens to be realistic, is Anderson.",
      "The Nottingham Forest star’s 2025/26 statistics put him up there as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. He has made 24 key passes (6th), 802 passes (5th), 111 progressive passes (1st), 111 ball recoveries (1st), 35 tackles (9th), 14 interceptions (23rd), won 29 fouls (2nd), and only received two yellow cards. And in Forest’s defeat to Brighton, Anderson became the first player in the last 10 Premier League seasons to record 100+ touches, 10+ ball recoveries, 10+ duels won, 5+ key passes and 5+ successful dribbles.",
      "He might not be Kante, but he could be Matic, and we’re confident he can become better than Jorginho, if he isn’t already.",
      "It would be a statement signing for Manchester United and there isn’t a better option out there among the players who would actually want to join. The fact he can do absolutely everything and has the engine to play midfield on his own makes him perfect for Amorim’s system. The only issue is the price. In January, you’re looking at £100m. In the summer, maybe closer to £80m. Better, but still very pricey. For England’s No.6, though? Probably worth it…",
      "",
      "Not only would Guehi massively improve United and walk straight in as a leader and their best defender, but signing him means Liverpool don’t, which is probably top of the list of positives, next to a blank column of negatives.",
      "There isn’t really much more to say about it. He would be an absolutely outstanding signing, but the odds are heavily stacked against United.",
      "Liverpool put all the groundwork into signing Guehi last summer and were hours away from getting it done, putting them comfortably ahead of the Red Devils in the race. He can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1, which gives Real Madrid a big advantage. They love a free transfer, need a centre-back and have dropped their interest in Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.",
      "But it’s still in United’s hands if they want it to be. Offer Palace £30m and they might struggle to reject it, considering he’s in the final six months of his deal. Just make a sufficient offer well before the deadline, lads.",
      "Liverpool are also in a much worse place than they were when Guehi agreed to join. They were reigning champions – and still are, technically – and looked set to dominate England and Europe after spending over £420m. Now they are mid-table, out of the title picture, and on an abysmal run of form. It’s not the place to be for someone like Guehi, though he could help fix the problem.",
      "And does Guehi even want to leave England? You’d have to ask him. Some players are reluctant to go abroad, especially if a top English club is offering a fat contract and guaranteed minutes. Real Madrid is the exception, though. You don’t turn down Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "It would be audacious to even try, and the noise surrounding Vinicius‘ situation at Real Madrid is probably a ploy to get a better contract. When he realises his only options are Manchester United or Saudi Arabia, he’ll likely return to Florentino Perez with his tail between his legs.",
      "But let’s say he actually does want to leave and refuses to renew. United would actually stand a chance. They are still, in the eyes of many, the biggest club in the world. They are an institution. Players are addicted to the idea of being ‘the one’ who finally fixes them after years of chaos.",
      "Out of all the big names United could chase, Vinicius would be the most ambitious and exciting. Leaving Real Madrid at 25, after being Ballon d’Or runner-up two years earlier, is not a normal career move. Joining United might be career suicide, but if anyone who is remotely gettable can single-handedly fix them, it’s Vinicius.",
      "",
      "Signing Anderson or Wharton, Guehi, and Vinicius is impossible without a significant sale or two. The best sale for everyone is Ugarte. Casemiro could work if the right offer arrives, but he’s actually been pretty good since Ruben Amorim came in. You could argue he’s been the Portuguese coach’s biggest success story so far. Then there’s Kobbie Mainoo, who is a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ pure profit option.",
      "Truth be told, only Saudi Arabia can bail Manchester United out when it comes to Ugarte. No Champions League contender will want him after back-to-back disappointing spells at two giant clubs. Sporting might want to re-sign him, but for nowhere near the £50m United paid Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. That leaves the filthy-rich Saudis, who will surely be interested in a big name like Ugarte, who is still only 24.",
      "It’s unrealistic, but not completely delusional. And United will only sanction his sale if they’ve already signed a new midfielder, or have one lined up.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules will probably still punish United anyway, but they can at least tell supporters they lived and enjoyed the dream while it lasted.",
      "",
      "Another significant windfall could come via the sale of Mason Greenwood from Marseille.",
      "Reports suggested United wanted to reintegrate Greenwood after his charges of attempted rape and assault were dropped, but after putting the feelers out, fan backlash was fierce. They quickly U-turned and pretended they always wanted to sell him. After a year on loan at Getafe, he joined Marseille for £26.7m, which was a low fee, but United’s hands were tied. In an uncharacteristically savvy move, they included a big sell-on clause, believed to be 50%.",
      "Transfermarkt says the 24-year-old is worth around £35m, but 10 goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season, coupled with his potential and previous seasons, suggests he will go for much more – perhaps around £60m, giving United £30m.",
      "And when Greenwood does leave Marseille, Manchester United will finally be able to close a dark chapter.",
      "READ NEXT: Top 10 transfer flops of the season: Liverpool trio shamed as Premier League clubs waste £500m",
      "Man Utd are ready to splash out on one of two Real Madrid players in the summer, while they want Antoine Semenyo in January, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to break their transfer record next summer on one of two players as they look to bring in a new midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",
      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has been backed to play for England again on one condition as he would solve “many problems”.",

      "The now honorary president of Bayern Munich called Newcastle’s £69m signing of Nick Woltemade “completely crazy”, suggested their record-breaking £13m loan deal of Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea was in fact good business, and can barely open his mouth without saying something salty about Liverpool landing Florian Wirtz ahead of the Bundesliga giants, most recently exposing Arne Slot’s “broken promise” over the playmaker’s shirt number.",
      "He’s a 73-year-old man struggling to come to terms with the Premier League’s gold-laden hands reaching out into a market that Bayern have cornered for decades, plundering the cream of the crop from the Bundesliga that they have historically hoovered up to dominate that division to the tune of 20 titles this century.",
      "“One farmer comes to another and says: I sold two cows for €50,000 each and bought four chickens for €25,000 each,” he joked through gritted teeth when discussing the inflated transfer market.",

      "Harry Kane to Chelsea\nA huge long shot for so many reasons, most of which are amusingly listed by the nameless ‘5 elite reporters’ working on the now infamous X account who got one thing right once, were credited by David Ornstein, and are now further buoyed to treat things overheard in a pub or proclaimed by an Uber driver as genuine transfer news.",
      "‘Kane’s age, his hefty wages, and the length of his contract are all hurdles,’ they admit, but insist the Tottenham legend (another ‘hurdle’ they didn’t consider) is Enzo Maresca’s ‘dream target’ who can be ‘the difference-maker in Chelsea’s quest for the Premier League and Champions League titles’.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich\nAfter insisting Bayern only actually paid £11.8m as Jackson and his agent paid the rest, which is definitely actually a very good deal for a striker that would likely cost roughly £1m per goal based on his past goalscoring antics, Hoeness went on to explain why the conditions required to trigger the further £56m to make his loan deal permanent would “never” be met.",
      "“The big money only has to be paid if he starts 40 games. He never does that.”",
      "With just five starts to his name it doesn’t look hugely likely that clause will be met, but a Harry Kane injury or January move could do the trick.",
      "",
      "Michael Olise to Arsenal\nQuite why Arsenal are ‘prepared to submit a record-breaking offer close to €150m (£131m)’ for a guy who’s played 173 games in his career on the right wing when they already have Bukayo Saka and have just signed a very serviceable back-up in Noni Madueke, over signing someone for the left wing, where Olise has played just nine times, isn’t entirely clear.",
      "But we’re not here to question the validity of Fichajes’ claims, we’re here to imagine the steam cascading from Hoeness’ ears when Arsenal sign Bayern’s most valuable player just because they can.",
      "",
      "Lennart Karl to Manchester City\n“It’s like Monopoly: move forward to Schlossallee [the German Mayfair], then some sheikh will come along and then you can buy,” Hoeness said during his rant on Newcastle pinching Woltemade from under their noses.",

      "Manchester United are running out of turning points.",
      "They can’t keep taking one step forward and then two steps back, and that’s the incredibly unsexy dance they performed once again in their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham after beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "That was a huge win, an unexpected win, against a very good team. They had to back that up with another win against a pretty poor one. Alas, they didn’t.",
      "Ruben Amorim should be criticised for his substitutions, which ultimately cost them victory on Thursday night. He even managed to spark debate with his starting XI.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made the bold call to hand young defender Ayden Heaven his first start of the season, with Matthijs de Ligt – the club’s player of the month – out due to a minor injury. Heaven didn’t come in for De Ligt, but for Leny Yoro, whose dropping to the bench was a “tactical” decision.",
      "Heaven needed to settle quickly, and he did the opposite, smashing into Jarrod Bowen with a slide tackle and receiving a yellow card after only eight minutes. Not ideal, but it clearly didn’t rattle him because he didn’t have a poor first half. Still, he evidently wasn’t good enough in Amorim’s eyes as he was substituted at half-time for Yoro, with the booking clearly concerning the Portuguese.",
      "Heaven starting on Thursday reaffirmed what we already knew: Kobbie Mainoo is in Man United exile.",
      "After emerging as one of the club’s best players under Erik ten Hag, becoming an England regular and starting in the final of Euro 2024, Mainoo can’t get a kick anymore, and a January sale is looking more likely with every passing week.",
      "Another appearance on the bench while Heaven was in the starting XI left Mainoo in worrying company with Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia as United’s only first-team players yet to start in the Premier League this season. If you were unsure, that’s their third-choice goalkeeper, a guy who has been injured all season, and someone who was in Amorim’s pre-season bomb squad.",
      "While his standing in the Red Devils’ squad hierarchy is striking, it’s not like he’d have transformed a cautious United performance.",
      "Amorim has said that he’s competing for a starting spot with club captain and best player Bruno Fernandes, and from the minor minutes we’ve seen of them together, it actually makes sense. But for Mainoo, it’s a horrible situation; Fernandes is literally undroppable. His form needs to fall off a cliff to be benched, and he’s only missed nine Premier League games in five full seasons, largely due to suspension.",
      "Casemiro has also been pretty good in midfield for the Red Devils and is Amorim’s biggest success story. He has been criticised for his rashness in the past, but he is more disciplined in that position than Mainoo.",
      "Man United fans are desperate to see Mainoo play more because they love him and he’s an academy graduate with incredible potential, but during a disappointing performance against West Ham, there can’t have been many people watching and thinking the game was crying out for him.",
      "Their performance made for a very dull first half at Old Trafford, highlighted largely by Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s defensive contributions.",
      "The first genuine moment of quality came from Alphonse Areola, who acrobatically tipped Bryan Mbeumo’s cross-cum-shot over the bar, denying United another set-piece goal that would have seen them overtake Arsenal in that statistic in the 2025/26 Premier League season.",
      "In terms of attacking quality, that was really all she wrote in the opening 45 minutes. There was a brief flurry of shots that could have sparked Ruben Amorim’s men into life; Wan-Bissaka cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off the line, Matheus Cunha had an overhead kick blocked, and Bruno Fernandes’ scissor volley clipped the post. It wasn’t the shot in the arm United needed, just three shots.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was player of the half, adding an incredible sliding tackle on Cunha in his own box before producing an expertly read headed clearance from a tantalising Fernandes cross.",
      "It was unfortunately much of the same when the game restarted, but in a match between two teams that can be excruciating to watch that was crying out for a goal, we finally got one just before the hour mark, and in fairness, it did improve proceedings.",
      "Diogo Dalot benefited from a bit of luck when Casemiro’s blocked shot fell straight to him, though he still had plenty to do. His first touch was perfect and the finish was that of an experienced No.9, shifting the ball past Wan-Bissaka and in the opposite direction of Areola’s momentum.",
      "Beating West Ham at home was the only acceptable outcome for United, and going up into the Champions League places would’ve been a welcome bonus. But after taking the lead, they didn’t push for a second, and as the second didn’t come and their opponents found an equaliser, Amorim’s substitutions will rightly be criticised.",
      "Patrick Dorgu on for the goalscorer, Manuel Ugarte for Matheus Cunha, and Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee suggested that Amorim thought it had to be a case of holding onto the one-goal lead rather than pressing on against one of the worst teams in the Premier League this year and putting the game to bed.",

      "United might feel aggrieved that Wan-Bissaka wasn’t shown the most blatant of second yellow cards you’ll see all season, but the fact of the matter is that they didn’t do nearly enough to win the game. Areola wasn’t tested enough and any half-chance they did get was rashly wasted, like Fernandes’ left-footed volley in the fifth minute of injury time.",
      "There was a serious lack of quality at Old Trafford. It was just a bad game of football. The United players looked dejected at the end, knowing it was an unacceptable performance and that West Ham at home should have been an easy three points.",
      "Questions will be asked about Amorim’s in-game management again. It cost United and epitomises their season so far: one step forward, two steps back. Just when you think they could get back amongst it, they do something stupid. It’s tiring for us, let alone someone who actually goes to the games.",
      "It’s bottom-club Wolves next. Another team in the relegation zone. No matter how poor they are, United can’t relax and act as if the game is won at 1-0. Or, knowing this team, even at 2-0.",
      "Amorim’s substitutions were so negative that they rubbed off on his players, who seemed to think it was game over and that they could just see it out. Nope. West Ham can still punish you. Even Wolves can still punish you.",
      "United can’t become too casual in these fixtures. They cannot follow an impressive win at Palace with a poor draw at home to West Ham. And we can’t keep looking at games and saying afterwards, ‘Well, Amorim will learn from this.’",

He said: “When a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep (down).

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for a Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton, though.",

It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that.

      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But , well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs went to Newcastle – and got a barely deserved draw – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ and a rare home win over Chelsea does anything more than delay the inevitable.",
      "Liverpool have their eye on Man Utd manager target Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace if they decide to sack Arne Slot, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd remain stuck in the same cycle under Ruben Amorim, taking one step forward at Crystal Palace and two steps back with a draw against West Ham.",

      "“He cannot show that to the people the way he came to the bench, he knows that. It shows he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game. He is fit and ready for the next challenge.”",
      "This answer from Amorim is largely positive, but the dig directed at Yoro in the opening sentence did not need to be said and could do more harm than good for the player’s confidence.",
      "It potentially gives Amorim an easily avoided problem when he has more pressing issues to consider, including fixing Man Utd’s ineffective attack.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have improved Man Utd’s attack generally, but Amorim’s side have somewhat reverted as injuries have impacted them.",
      "This was particularly the case as Man Utd failed to break down 10-man Everton, while they were hardly free-flowing in their attacking moments against Palace.",
      "So, it is a big boost for Man Utd that Cunha is available to start following his injury absence.",
      "Cunha has quickly struck a great partnership with Mbeumo and offers Man Utd great creativity and work rate. Amorim’s side will immediately be a more threatening unit with him back in the side, and he has been sent a message to reach new heights.",
      "“He has more levels to go,” Amorim added when asked about Cunha’s return to full fitness.",
      "“He’s at a different club, different pressure, he was struggling because he was not scoring and because of social media abuse, he was thinking too much about the numbers but the influence he has in the team is important to us.",
      "“I think he has so much to grow offensively and defensively.”",

      "Liverpool have their eye on Man Utd manager target Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace if they decide to sack Arne Slot, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has handed young defender Ayden Heaven his first league start of the season, leaving Kobbie Mainoo in some concerning company.",
      "Daniel Farke is clear Sack Race favourite as Leeds slump into the bottom three, but Thomas Frank and Arne Slot are hot on his heels amid Spurs and Liverpool crises.",
      "Amorim has confirmed that two players on top of Sesko and Maguire are injury doubts ahead of Man Utd vs West Ham.",

      "Rumoured Man Utd target Federico Valverde is reportedly the subject of a bid from a mystery club amid unrest at Xabi Alonso’s Real Madrid.",
      "The Red Devils are set to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window with low-cost options such as Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher and Wolves’ Joao Gomes likely to be the most attainable in the winter.",
      "A potential midfield signing wasn’t entirely overlooked in the summer, with Man Utd making enquiries for Gallagher and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, but some fans and former players feel it wasn’t made enough of a priority.",
      "Man Utd have improved a bit this term but there are rumours that Ruben Amorim is demanding a new midfielder in January as he looks to push his seventh-placed Red Devils up the table.",
      "One midfielder they have been heavily linked to is Real Madrid’s Valverde with reports in Spain claiming that he is one of seven names wanting Alonso out at Real Madrid.",
      "The report claims: ‘The dressing room is divided into two factions. Two opposing views. The majority group is the most critical. The sector that no longer trusts Xabi. The one that feels his methods clash with the club’s identity. And here are the seven names leading this stance: Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Valverde, Brahim Diaz, Ferland Mendy, and Eduardo Camavinga. Endrick joins them, also expressing his discomfort.’",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "The same publication also claims that Valverde and England international Bellingham have both been the subject of ‘offers exceeding €100m (£88m)’.",
      "It is understood that Bellingham ‘can’t find the space or the freedom that made him shine in his first year, while the Uruguayan feels out of rhythm, disconnected, and lacking the physical presence that usually makes him a game-changer.’",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could be one player to make way in the January transfer window if another midfielder joins with the England international keen to find regular football ahead of the World Cup in the summer.",
      "When asked if Mainoo should join West Ham in January on loan to gain minutes, former Chelsea and England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips told BestBettingSites: “Well, if Man United are not gonna play him or sell him, it’s a good move from my point of view.",
      "“If he wants to be at the World Cup he should take the chance. I think he’s plenty good enough. It must be so frustrating for him knowing his ability and how well he has done, even when he has only had a few minutes, that the endgame is still the same.",
      "“At that age, you just want to play football, you just want to express yourself. He burst onto the scene and for a while he was always the first name on the team sheet. Now all of a sudden no matter what he does, he’s not on the team sheet. So where do you go from there? For me, he has to look elsewhere. He needs to get football. He needs to get minutes.",
      "“As far as I can tell, he hasn’t done anything wrong. If you look at Man United over the last year, you could arguably say that when he has played, he’s been one of Man United’s best players. So the treatment that he’s getting, I honestly can’t understand it.",
      "“Hence the reason why I’m saying that no matter what he does, he’s not going to start unless something happens and unless Casemiro’s form drops again, or someone gets injured, I think he just will not get a start on merit. Which is the sad thing, because he would be in there otherwise.”",

      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping their cards close to their chest regarding Casemiro and Harry Maguire, which they are right to do…",
      "An embarrassing loss against 10-man Everton and a tad fortunate win against a spent Crystal Palace side have dampened spirits at Man Utd following their five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League.",
      "Their performances in these games have once again made it apparent that Ruben Amorim‘s side are sorely lacking in certain positions and they are still a while away from contesting for the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "Still, the shambolic mess of last season was never likely to be fixed in a single transfer window and positive steps have been taken to get the club back on an even keel.",
      "Firstly, most of their so-called ‘bomb squad’ were sent elsewhere in deals on United’s terms, with permanent deals or future fees secured for Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund, while Aston Villa loanee Jadon Sancho’s career at Man Utd is also all but over as his contract expires next summer.",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "This provided Man Utd the funds to spend around £230m on overhauling their attack and signing a new No.1 goalkeeper, with Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo their marquee additions.",
      "These signings have made a positive impact, but upgrades are still required in centre-midfield and wing-back, especially, while they could also do with landing extra quality at centre-back and up front to provide adequate depth.",
      "Champions League qualification would boost their coffers to execute this business, but Man Utd may also have to wheel and deal to raise funds as they did in the summer.",
      "One such way the Red Devils could free up cash is via adjusting player contracts, with Casemiro and Maguire among those facing uncertain futures at Old Trafford.",
      "Casemiro is one of six Premier League players enjoying an unexpected renaissance, as his great form has ensured that Kobbie Mainoo’s continued absence has become a lesser topic, while Maguire has remained an important squad player for Man Utd.",
      "With Casemiro, he currently earns around £375,000 a week, and this can be extended on the same terms until 2027. Maguire, meanwhile, earns roughly £180,000 a week, and a completely fresh deal is required if he’s to remain at the club beyond the summer.",
      "And The Daily Mail have shed light on the situation regarding these two players, claiming ‘neither player has a concrete offer on the table at the moment, although United still have time to stop them from leaving as free agents in the summer’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘United are determined to drive down their wage bill, and Maguire and Casemiro are two of the bigger earners as well as being among the oldest players in the squad.’",
      "This is the perfect approach from Man Utd’s hierarchy.",
      "It is easy to justify keeping Casemiro and Maguire beyond this season, given the roles they have played this season, but this comes with the caveat that each player must accept a pay cut to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "That would be the ideal outcome for Man Utd, but letting one or both leave would be a necessary evil if contracts for these players are in the way of the club signing a Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and/or Elliot Anderson next summer.",

So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",

      "“The transition for the future wasn’t prepared when Sir Alex left,” he continues. “Everyone in his backroom staff went with him and that was a problem. There was a big gap to be filled and a very difficult one.",

      "“It was always going to be a case of giving him time and getting players into the squad to play in the system he wants to play, so Amorim needs time and assurances from the club if they want to build a squad that can compete for the title with him.",

      "Introducing the Premier League of Christmas jumpers 2025:",
      "",
      "1) West Ham’s Christmas collection",
      "The design team at West Ham have been having a lot of fun with their Christmas jumpers and we absolutely approve.",
      "‘Santa is a Hammer’, ‘I’m forever blowing baubles’ and ‘All I Want For Christmas Is WHU’ are inspired choices and the club has even rolled out Jarren Bowen to model the collection.",
      "Tacky, pun-tastic and perfectly blending club-specific chants with a Christmas theme. The Hammers have nailed it.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool’s Candy Cane",
      "Liverpool’s standard Christmas jumper is about as disappointing as an Ibrahim Konate contract saga. It’s a bit red and white with some generic Christmas fare such as snowflakes.",
      "Luckily something is going right at Anfield at the moment because whoever designed the Candy-kit inspired Christmas jumper has knocked it out of the park. It is one of the greatest kits of all time and the white patterns lend themselves perfectly to a Christmas feel.",

      "Newcastle’s confused striped Christmas jumper gets plenty of points because it is truly ugly, like all Christmas jumpers should be.",
      "The dazzling array of stripes, Christmas tree shapes and snowflakes is certainly dazzling but it does lose points for not even trying to fit in the Newcastle Brown Ale star as some sort of Christmas tree topper.",
      "",
      "5) Everton’s Spirit of the Blues",
      "Everton’s 1998-inspired Christmas jumper and the One2One kit is a nice idea but is slightly ruined by the memory of one of the worst ever Premier League teams to somehow avoid relegation.",
      "Instead, the Spirit of the Blues Christmas jumper is our pick because the song that inspired it is the most Christmassy of all the football chants heard across the Premier League. The ‘woo’ part may baffle opposition fans but it just feels festive. Good work, Everton.",

      "6) Chillin at Cold Trafford",
      "Despite risking an angry phone call from Cole Palmer’s lawyers, Manchester United have released a fantastically hideous jumper featuring a snowman and the phrase ‘Chillin at Cold Trafford’.",
      "The patchwork style jumper is so bad it’s good and we’re picking this one over the admittedly quite nice red and white jumper featuring the famous statue of George Best, Dennis Law and Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal’s Highbury Wonderland",
      "The Arsenal Highbury kit worn during the 2005/6 season is demonstrably one of the greatest Premier League home shirts, helped by the fact it was worn by some of the league’s best ever players.",
      "The Highbury Wonderland jumper based on the kit is quite nice. In fact, it’s too nice. Apart from the reindeer leaping over the Arsenal badge there is no hint of garish Christmas symbolism being crowbarred into a football theme. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "8) Spurs’ retro Christmas jumper",
      "Spurs have the enviable position of playing in all white, making any sort of Christmas design pretty easy. The retro Christmas jumper has plenty of nice touches. The Christmas pudding sponsor, the subtle snowflake pattern and the retro Spurs badge reminding us of happier times at White Hart Lane.",
      "Unfortunately the jumper loses points because it’s trying too hard to look like a football kit. We want snowmen and holly patterns, not nicely striped collars.",
      "",
      "9) Leeds’ Christmas jumper",
      "The Leeds Christmas jumper is quite nice. It has the Yorkshire rose, the club’s foundation date, some reindeer and a few snowflakes in a patchwork pattern.",
      "It is a very run of the mill Christmas jumper slightly ruined by the giant modern Leeds badge on the back. There is nothing particularly offensive by it and it’s a solid mid-table effort.",
      "",
      "10) Chelsea’s Christmas jumper",
      "Chelsea’s Christmas jumper is your bog standard effort. It’s blue and white, with Christmas trees, snowflakes and the Chelsea lion all blended into a neat patchwork design.",
      "It’s just fine. Nothing too exciting, very little design flair, but ticks all the Christmas boxes. Like a Mourinho defence of old this one is playing it safe and grinding out the points in the Christmas jumper table.",
      "",
      "11) Villa Park Christmas jumper",
      "Villa Park is one of the best grounds in the Premier League and it should be celebrated as an old school football stadium with a fantastic atmosphere.",
      "It should not, however, be celebrated on a Christmas jumper. The design is fine in that it features a bit of snow and some snowflakes, but the giant badge and stadium design feels a bit too serious.",
      "",
      "12) Wolves’ Christmas jumper",
      "Wolves offer exactly the same Christmas jumper as Burnley’s sorry effort but there is another option. Like Spurs, Wolves have gone down the classic kit route and the 1982-inspired jumper does have a nice stocking built into the alternative Goodyear logo.",
      "It is a bit bland, featuring no other highlights outside of a subtle snowflake pattern, but the Old Gold does at least feel a bit Christmassy.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester City’s Elf",
      "Manchester City have not really got into the Christmas spirit. There’s a pretty generic City badge design covered in snowflakes and one that features an elf design that is completed with your head when it’s worn.",
      "It’s a tired Christmas jumper trope but this one is saved by the fact the club will done £5 from every sale to support patients and their families at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.",
      "",
      "14) Forest’s Christmas jumper",
      "For a club whose badge is literally a tree crowned by two stars there is a distinct lack of Christmas feel in the fairly tame Forest Christmas jumper.",
      "Turning the badge into the Christmas tree is a missed chance that is so glaring Sean Dyche is probably treating the designers to their very own Gaffer’s Day as a punishment.",
      "The jumper is fine, but lacks any sort of flair. At least Dyche will agree with that bit.",
      "",
      "15) Crystal Palace Christmas jumper",
      "Crystal Palace have had some of the best kits in the Premier League in recent years so we had high hopes for the Christmas jumper of 2025.",
      "Unfortunately it’s a bit of a mess. The blue and red combine to make it seem sort of brown somehow and the design is unimaginative. Christmas jumpers are supposed to look a bit hideous but this one just looks a bit depressing.",
      "A big swing and a miss with the ‘South London and Proud’ slogan instead of something more Christmassy too.",
      "",
      "16) Sunderland Christmas jumper",
      "Sunderland’s jumper is red and white, features the word Sunderland and some half-hearted Christmas patterns.",
      "",
      "17) Burnley’s Christmas jumper",
      "Is there some sort of connection with garden gnomes and Christmas we do not know about? The Burnley Christmas jumper is pretty standard fare until you drill into the details.",
      "It features rows of sort of Christmas-themed images including baubles and snowflakes. Then you get to the aforementioned gnomes. At least they’re holding Christmas presents.",
      "A very confused Christmas jumper from a club that has a jumper aficionado as manager. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "18) Fulham’s Christmas jumper",
      "The same as the Burnley monstrosity, this is just a templated Christmas jumper featuring the baubles, the gnomes and the layered pattern.",

      "",
      "19) Brentford’s Christmas jumper",
      "The Brentford Christmas jumper is ugly enough to pass as a Christmas jumper but apart from two reindeer either side of the huge Brentford badge, it’s not screaming actual Christmas.",
      "The club has made the choice of using bee patterns instead of snowflakes and while that is unique, it feels more like a spring or summer jumper. And since they don’t exist it means relegation for Brentford.",
      "",
      "20) Brighton’s Christmas jumper",
      "Brighton have used a Millwall-style dark blue for their Christmas jumper and then stuck BHAFC on and done little else with the design.",
      "It is a jumper designed to be trendy and modern, but that is not the point of a Christmas jumper. It should make you look ridiculous at your office party.",
      "As a punishment for taking the task too seriously and ignoring the club’s actual colours, Brighton finish rock bottom of the Christmas jumper table."

      "ESPN, meanwhile, are reporting that Man Utd are quite likely to let Mainoo and three other players leave to fund a January signing.",
      "The report claims: ‘The club will listen to offers for Mainoo, Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia, but allowing any to leave before the end of AFCON on Jan. 18 would leave Amorim desperately short of players.",

      "Man Utd could now land a midfielder they regret being the alternative rather than the top target in the summer of 2024.",
      "Is this a “big, big few weeks” for the Manchester United star? The last two games suggests it will be more of the same.",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "The three points that would have lifted Ruben Amorim's side up to fifth in the table looked to be theirs when Diogo Dalot finished smartly just before the hour but United failed to see it through with Magassa's neat finish allowing West Ham to claim a point.",
      "United, who lost at home to 10-man Everton in their previous home fixture, do move above Liverpool into eighth but this was a missed opportunity. Nuno Espirito Santo will take the point, his side still among the bottom three but only two points from safety.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Mazraoui (7), Heaven (6), Shaw (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (7), Cunha (6), Mbeumo (6), Zirkzee (6).\n\n\nSubs: Yoro (6), Dorgu (6), Mount (n/a), Ugarte (n/a), Martinez (n/a).\n\n\nWest Ham: Areola (6), Wan-Bissaka (8), Todibo (7), Mavropanos (7), Diouf (7), Potts (7), Magassa (8), Fernandes (6), Soucek (6), Bowen (7), Wilson (6). \n\n\nSubs: Irving (n/a), Kante (n/a), Kilman (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Soungoutou Magassa.",
      "West Ham, who have now picked up eight points from their last five games under Nuno, showed some attacking intent in the first half an hour of the contest, Casemiro having to slide to block Matheus Fernandes' low shot. But United pushed thereafter.",
      "Alphonse Areola tipped over Bryan Mbeumo's cross-shot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line from Joshua Zirkzee and Bruno Fernandes' effort on the follow up shaved the post. United finished the first half with a season-high 25 touches in the opposition box.",
      "Ayden Heaven, making his first start since the debacle against Grimsby, was withdrawn at half-time having picked up an early booking, but the United boss maintained his 3-4-3 structure, of course. And it was his left wing-back of all people who opened the scoring.",
      "Wandering into the box unmarked, the ball fell kindly to Dalot and the Portuguese defender slammed the ball into the net to lift the mood inside Old Trafford. But the fact that they were unable to capitalise on it highlighted why Amorim's team still frustrate.",
      "Andy Irving swung in a corner with his first touch after coming on, Jarrod Bowen won the flick on ahead of Fernandes and though Noussair Mazraoui cleared off the line, Magassa's slotted away the rebound. West Ham even threatened to score a winner.",
      "Since Nuno Espirito Santo’s first game in charge of West Ham, only Aston Villa (9) have won more Premier League points from losing positions than the Hammers (8).",
      "That would have been pushing it but they do not look like a team that will be facing relegation under Nuno in the spring. Where Amorim's United find themselves is less clear. Champions League qualification is a possibility. But not with this sloppiness.",
      "\"The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group players? I've watched the games closely. The lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team.",

      "United fought back from a goal down to secure an away win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday but continue to be held back by inconsistency under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "They have managed to beat both Liverpool and Chelsea this season but the embarrassment of their defeat to 10-man Everton is still fresh in the memories of fans and Amorim.",
      "The signings of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have added quality to their forward ranks, with Amad also providing some sparkling displays and, although they sit seventh in the Premier League, the gap to Manchester City in second is only four points.",
      "When asked about the level at which United will be competing in two years' time, Amad said: \"Honestly, why not winning the league? Dreaming is possible, no?\"",
      "Mbeumo added: \"If you come to Manchester United, you want to win titles and the Premier League is one of them, so why not?\"",
      "Amorim took charge of his 40th Premier League match against Palace and averages 1.18 points per game, which remains significantly lower than previous boss Erik ten Hag's record of 1.72 points per game.",
      "However, results and performances have improved this term with United taking 21 points from 13 games at a rate of 1.61 per game.",
      "Amad believes the team is moving in the right direction under Amorim, having changed their mindset following last season's record-low 15th-placed Premier League finish.",
      "He said: \"From my personal side, I think we are improving a lot, especially as a team, because I can remember last season some of the games weren't easy for us.",
      "\"We were going into games already thinking we lost the game, but this season is different. Different mindset, different energy.",
      "\"We go to the game and we feel we can win this game, so I think we are improving and the staff also are helping us to make that step.",
      "\"We are not really happy where we are in the table we are right now, but we will improve. What I can say, I'm sure we will do much better for the next game.",
      "\"I think we are a different team now. We know this season is different than last season. We play one game a week, so we have to try to do better every game.",
      "\"The mindset is positive in the dressing room. We are a different team. Bruno [Fernandes] is a leader, [Harry] Maguire, everyone, even Bryan.",
      "\"I think the energy is positive. Honestly, it's much, much better than last season. Like I say, we want to do better every game and I promise we will.\"",
      "Mbeumo, a summer signing from Brentford, has adapted quickly to life at United and is the club's top scorer in the Premier League this season with five goals.",
      "Despite making the transition from west London to Manchester look easy, Mbeumo reveals it's been anything but.",
      "He said: \"First of all, it's not been easy at all.",
      "\"I think I just rely on the hard work, on training, even outside of the pitch, what I'm doing on the side to put every chance for me to do well here. The whole team has helped me a lot to grow as a player here, to find my place and find my place with the team.\"",
      "Amad and Mbeumo have forged a strong understanding on United's right, playing as wing-back and winger respectively and combining to good effect in the final third.",
      "Their chemistry was on show when Amad assisted Mbeumo for the opening goal in the 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield. They combined again for the opener in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham.",
      "\"We have a good relationship,\" said Mbeumo.",
      "\"He helped me when I came, obviously we speak the same language, so it was easier for me to go with him. He was telling me a bit how it was working here as well, so I think we built the relationship from the first day.\"",
      "He added: \"We speak the same language, so it's easier to find the links because we can talk about what happened, even during the game it's easier because sometimes he wants the ball somewhere, so I know and for me it's the same.",
      "\"Even after the game we can discuss about some offensive play that could have been better.\"",
      "The pair will hope to continue building their mutual understanding at home to West Ham on Thursday as Manchester United aim to build on their comeback win over Palace.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek...",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
