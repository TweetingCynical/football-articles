      "Ex-Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood has been spotted training in England, a year after his move to Marseille. The 23-year-old uploaded photos to social media of himself partaking in drills at the home of Manchester-based non-league side Chadderton FC.",
      "The Bradford-born forward joined the Red Devils' academy at the tender age of six and made his first-team debut under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019, soon becoming the club's youngest European goalscorer at just 17.",
      "In October 2022, Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and controlling and coercive behaviour. These charges were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service a year later.",
      "Following his arrest, Greenwood was suspended by United and loaned out to Spanish side Getafe. In July of 2024, he left Old Trafford for good, signing for Ligue 1 side Marseille in a deal worth £26.6million.",
      "Pictures on Instagram show Greenwood taking part in sprints and shooting drills on Chadderton's new 3G pitch, alongside former United team-mate D'Mani Mellor.",
      "Mellor and Greenwood once shared the pitch during a shocking 2-1 loss to Astana in the Europa League back in 2019. The United youngsters had taken an early lead through Jesse Lingard, only to be shocked by a second-half revival from the Kazakhstani side, cemented by an own goal from Di'Shon Bernard.",
      "The 24-year-old experienced a series of loan moves before a permanent switch to Wycombe Wanderers in 2022. He is now starring for Macclesfield and was spotted training with Greenwood once again earlier this month, this time at a Manchester-based facility.",
      "As for Greenwood, his first campaign with Marseille was an incredibly successful one, as he tied with Ballon d'Or hopeful and Champions League winner Ousmane Dembele atop the Ligue 1 goal-scoring charts with 21.",
      "This prolific strike rate helped his team secure a second-placed finish, earning them a berth in next season's Champions League. They'll also be welcoming former United hopeful Angel Gomes into their ranks.",
      "Marseille's championing of Greenwood doesn't end there; team-mate Adrien Rabiot held nothing back in his praise, telling The Athletic: \"Mason is an incredible player.",
      "\"If he hadn't had all of his problems, I think he'd have an image like [Jude] Bellingham. Mason would be the star. Because he's an exceptional player.",
      "\"He can score with his right foot and his left foot, he has an exceptional shot, he can dribble. We're very lucky to have him. When he's really focused, he does really great things.\"",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "Malick Fofana has been pictured wearing a Manchester United shirt after emerging as a target for the Red Devils. The young Lyon winger has been linked with United, Chelsea and Liverpool already this summer.",
      "But, while highlighting his work before pre-season is underway, Fofana has issued an update that sees him in United colours. Posting on his Instagram, the 20-year-old winger has uploaded photographs of him training wearing United's third kit from 2022/23.",
      "The luminous green shirt displays Marcus Rashford's name and number on the back. Though any prospect of Fofana playing alongside the England international appears unlikely with Rashord expected to depart this summer.",
      "Reports in France suggest Fofana's future could lie elsewhere before Lyon return to training on July 7. The Belgian is said to be valued higher than Rayan Cherki, who joined Manchester City for £34million, and Chelsea have already made contract with the French club.",
      "An exit for Fofana could now be more likely after Lyon were relegated Ligue 2 on after failing to provide financial guarantees to the game's watchdog. The ex-Gent ace scored five goals and provided four assists in 29 games in Ligue 1 and made his Belgium debut in November.",
      "Ahead of this summer, Fofana changed his representatives, signing with Roc Nation Sports. But his former agency, BF SportsPartner, have previously claimed that a move to Liverpool would be Fofana's dream. They told Africafoot earlier this year: \"The choice of heart would be Liverpool.",
      "\"He has the potential to enter the rotation, and above all, we would like to see him succeed African legends such as Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and El-Hadji Diouf. He has the profile to succeed in the Premier League.",
      "\"He possesses qualities similar to those of Manchester United's Amad Diallo, namely speed, impact, and the ability to create opportunities. There's no doubt he can shine.",
      "\"For him, this would be an opportunity to continue his development and, above all, to showcase his talent in a league that favours transitional play. However, he'll have to choose the right club, as competition is fierce across the (English) Channel.\"",
      "United are looking to strengthen their forward line this summer but Ruben Amorim is still waiting for the Red Devils to add to their first signing. Matheus Cunha arrived at Old Trafford earlier in June in a £62.5m deal.",
      "The Red Devils have seen multiple bids for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo rejected. Brentford are holding out for a fee near £65m and it remains to be seen if United return with an improved offer.",
      "Mbeumo has expressed his desire to move to Old Trafford, having also drawn interest from Tottenham. It remains to be see if United turn to other targets or pay what Brentford are asking however.",

      "But that parties players don't even know are attempting to speak to clubs on their behalf, indicates the opportunism present sometimes in the transfer market. Former Manchester United youngster Timothy Fosu-Mensah has learned as much in his year without a club.",
      "The 27-year-old, who first made his name with the Red Devils under Louis van Gaal, last played for Bayer Leverkusen in April 2023 before leaving the club the following year having failed to make an appearance in their title-winning season under Xabi Alonso. And following that Fosu-Mensah has spent 12 months as a free agent and learned about a new aspect of the footballing world.",
      "The defender has experienced plenty of difficulties in his career. The Dutchman has been impacted by managerial changes — Van Gaal was replaced by Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford who spoke of 'great potential” and promised 'plenty of opportunities' before offering just one Premier League start in a season — seen a loan opportunity end via a horrific cruciate ligament injury and most recently failed to find a club after being shown the door by Leverkusen.",
      "And as a result of that final blow, Fosuh-Mensah has found himself the subject of agent talks despite never coming into contact with the representatives himself. It's a situation that he has deemed a 'mess'",
      "\"There was a couple of situations with agents here and there, which was a bit of a mess,\" he said. \"People were speaking on my name who I never even had contact with.",
      "\"I would say like 80 per cent of the agents who were approaching clubs and people I didn’t even know, who I didn’t even had contact with. I think that was a big mess.\"",
      "That period included talks with Championship clubs. “Some of them I was aware of, some of them I wasn’t,” Fosu-Mensah added.",
      "The defender, who saw spells on loan with Crystal Palace and Fulham while at United, has spent time training with boyhood Ajax in recent months to ensure fitness. And despite his experiences, is confident he will find a new team to represent.",
      "“Last season was the first time in my career that I’ve spent without a team,” Fosu-Mensah said. “At this age it’s quite early and I think quite strange for people.",
      "“I know I’ve been working hard and hard work won’t go unnoticed. That’s what I believe.",
      "“If you stay at home, you do nothing and then you think ‘boom, OK, I’m going to go this club or that club’, no, that’s not how it works, that’s not my mentality. It’s definitely a fresh start and I’ve been working hard.”",

      "Borussia Dortmund midfielder Felix Nmecha has been linked with a move to Manchester United. He would already be familiar with his surroundings, having spent much of his youth career with Manchester City.",
      "Nmecha was signed by Dortmund for around £25million (€30m) from Werder Bremen in 2023. While injury limited his game time during his debut campaign, the versatile centre midfielder has made 39 appearances this season and impressed for Dortmund at the Club World Cup, which could prompt a return to the Premier League.",
      "The 24-year-old, whose older brother Lukas also rose through the ranks at City, featured three times during his stint with Pep Guardiola’s side. However, Nmecha eventually swapped England for Germany at both club and international level, having previously represented the Three Lions’ age-group sides.",
      "Caught Offside has reported that United are interested in bringing Nmecha to Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to rebuild his team. Dortmund are on the verge of selling Jamie Gittens to Chelsea but are said to be unwilling to cash in on Nmecha.",
      "Whether Nmecha does complete a move to Old Trafford remains to be seen, but Guardiola was aware of the player’s potential before he left City in 2021. After a win over Oxford United in the Carabao Cup, Guardiola name-checked Nmecha as one of three players to watch out for, despite not handing the then-17-year-old his debut.",
      "\"Eric Garcia played amazing in pre-season and Felix Nmecha is a guy who has a good perspective too. Today Adria [Bernabe] played some minutes. It depends on them but if they have quality in some moments they can show us they can play.\"",
      "Nmecha was eventually given his first team bow in the second leg of City’s semi-final with Burton Albion, which Guardiola’s team started with a 9-0 advantage. Despite the lack of jeopardy, Nmecha was again one of several players praised by the City boss.",
      "The City academy graduate ultimately struggled to earn more first team opportunities. He registered a Champions League assist during a brief cameo against Olympiacos in 2020 and was named in his sole Premier League matchday squad later that year.",
      "However, it took Nmecha little time to prove himself after leaving City and reuniting with his brother Lukas at Werder Bremen. In January 2022, Sport Bible reported that England were at risk of losing Nmecha, who had played for the Three Lions from U16 to U19 level.",
      "The midfielder was said to be in talks with the German federation over declaring for the country. His older brother Lukas had made the same switch after playing for England U21s. The warning proved to be prescient for Gareth Southgate, who had also failed to convince Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala to continue representing England a year earlier.",
      "The younger Nmecha made his Germany U21 debut in March 2022 and became a senior international 12 months later. He currently has four caps for Germany..",
      "A move to United this summer would represent another type of synergy for the Nmecha brothers. Lukas, 26, recently sealed a return to England by signing for newly-promoted Leeds United as a free agent.",

Pogba, who left United in 2022, has joined the Ligue 1 side to end his two-year absence from football, having been banned for 18 months because of a doping offence.",
      "The Frenchman has signed a two-year deal with Monaco, having had his contract with Juventus terminated midway through his suspension. Sancho, 25, could follow Pogba in finding a new club this summer, as he appears to have no long-term future at Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea opted not to sign him permanently following an unconvincing loan spell, scoring five goals and laying on eight assists in 41 appearances. The Blues even paid United a £5million penalty fee in order to avoid having to go through with their £25m obligation to buy him at the end of last season.",
      "The winger is due to return for pre-season training next month at Carrington, where he'll work under Ruben Amorim ahead of their tour of the USA. In the meantime, Sancho is on holiday and had time to send Pogba a message.",
      "On Instagram, his former team-mate had shared an image himself in a Monaco shirt. Sancho reposted the snap and wrote: \"PP is back,\" alongside cold face and red heart emojis.",

      "Sancho signed for United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021, as the Red Devils forked out £73m to end a year-long pursuit of the England international. But he's failed to impress under multiple United managers, most notably Erik ten Hag, who was replaced by Amorim after Sancho had joined Chelsea.",

      "Emi Martinez remains an option to replace Onana if United do move for an alternative. If they are to pursue a cheaper alternative, Botafogo keeper John is said to be an option.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres will refuse to return to Sporting Lisbon this summer in an attempt to force through a transfer. Things have turned increasingly sour between the Swedish striker and his current club, who are dragging their feet over his exit in an attempt to extract the best transfer fee possible.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas has been extremely vocal recently about the bitter saga in an attempt to keep supporters onside. At the centre of the dispute is an apparent gentleman's agreement, made between Gyokeres and the club hierarchy, that he would be allowed to leave for less than his official release clause.",
      "Gyokeres has made it clear that this summer is his time to leave Lisbon in search of new opportunities and a higher level of football. He plundered 53 goals and 13 assists in 51 games across the 2024/25 season, helping Sporting win the league and cup double, and feels he should be afforded some good will.",
      "Sporting have granted Gyokeres an extra week off before he is due to report for pre-season, but Portuguese newspaper Record says he has no intention of showing up.",
      "The 27-year-old is fed up with the situation and has personally told Varandas that he feels betrayed and therefore won’t play ball. He has also threatened to speak publicly to give his side of the story.",
      "Gyokeres has been a target of both Manchester United and Arsenal, who previously saw an offer of £55m rejected by Sporting. But with United moving for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and Arsenal preferring RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, there has been little movement in recent weeks.",
      "That has left Gyokeres frustrated, with the former Coventry man wanting to get a move sorted as soon as possible. Things have deteriorated and, when he does leave, it will be under a cloud, with Varandas refusing to back down.",
      "\"Sporting is calm regarding this matter,\" he said. \"Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Viktor Gyökeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "\"However, we remain sensitive to Viktor’s dreams or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.",
      "\"Today, there is a strong likelihood that he will leave. I won’t disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for 60+10m. He won’t leave, absolutely not.",
      "\"We have been watching the market and I saw [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, leave for €65million. I saw Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both forwards but who, in my opinion, do not have Viktor's market value or quality, being negotiated for around €75million.",

      "The biggest stumbling block to Gyokeres' departure is Sporting's willingness to let him depart and how much they will ultimately demand before deciding to let him leave for pastures new. United have already spent £62.5million to land Cunha - their only summer signing.",

      "United were able to land Cunha due to a release clause in his contract but their pursuit of Mbeumo, and potentially Gyokeres, has seen clubs demand huge fees and drag out negotiations in an effort to maximise their profits.",

      "He was then retained by Ruben Amorim as he replaced the Dutchman. But Fletcher has now seen his role changed once more. The Athletic report that he has been offered the role of the lead coach of the under-18s by director of football Jason Wilcox and outgoing director of academy Nick Cox as a replacement for Adam Lawrence.",

      "Manchester United have received fresh boosts in their quest to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer. Ruben Amorim, who managed the Swedish striker at Sporting CP, is still looking to add to his attacking options, having already snapped up Matheus Cunha.",
      "Despite his relationship with Amorim, Arsenal appeared to be ahead of United in the queue to sign Gyokeres, who has scored an incredible 97 goals in 102 games since signing for the Portuguese giants from Coventry City in 2023. However, the Gunners, who are desperate to land a top-class number nine this summer, may feel compelled to focus on another target, which would be excellent news for United.",
      "Benjamin Sesko could be a more realistic target and a cheaper option after RB Leipzig dropped their asking price from £68million-£85m to around £59.7m, according to German outlet Bild. With the Gunners looking elsewhere, United could have an opportunity to swoop and make a statement signing ahead of Amorim’s first full season.",
      "And in a fresh boost for United, Sporting appear to be making plans for life after Gyokeres, who is at odds with the club over his price tag. With their star striker’s future up in the air, the Lisbon side have reportedly set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic as a potential replacement.",
      "Per Germanijak.HR , Sporting have lodged a bid of around £17m, which is short of the Belgian champions’ valuation of £25.6m. Besiktas and Frankfurt , plus clubs in Italy, are also said to be interested in Ivanovic, who netted 20 goals for the Belgian champions last season.",
      "Sporting landing a striker with a strong goalscoring record for less than £30m may also help United in their negotiations for Gyokeres, who is at odds with the Sporting hierarchy over his price tag.",

Sporting president Frederico Varandas has denied that such an arrangement exists but has confirmed that the club did promise the 27-year-old they would not hold out for the full value stated in the release clause, believed to be almost £85m.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to sanction a loan move for Andre Onana after stumbling into a real issue regarding his future. The Cameroonian international has endured a tricky couple of seasons since his arrival from Inter Milan.",
      "High-profile errors have blighted his performances and put his position as number one in jeopardy. United are open to letting him leave and would apparently prefer a permanent sale.",
      "But Onana’s high wages have made an exit this summer tricky and Red Devils chiefs are now having to get creative to move him on. According to The Sun, United are open to letting Onana leave on loan.",
      "Monaco - who have recently signed ex-United midfielder Paul Pogba - have been linked with a move but have struggled to get a deal over the line. It is said that United are now awaiting approaches and would prefer to send the 29-year-old to Europe as opposed to a Premier League rival.",
      "Speaking earlier this month, Onana appeared to hint that he was also open to an exit. He said: \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "While Onana’s future remains up in the air, United have already launched their search for a new number one. Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez remains their number one target but a deal for the 2022 World Cup winner is expected to be expensive.",
      "Other options include Botafogo’s John Victor, Porto star Diogo Costa and Cruz Azul number one Kevin Mier. Former United stopper Ben Foster believes that Martinez would be the outstanding candidate should Onana be moved on.",
      "He said: “It's a brutal league, the Premier League, and I kind of think [over] the last two seasons that he [Onana] hasn't done enough to prove that he is a Manchester United number one.",
      "“I think he's got ability, and like so many other Man United players, he'd go elsewhere and probably flourish. I think that's probably going to be the case with him as well. If the opportunity does come to sign somebody like Emi Martinez, they've got to go for it. He's still one of the best goalkeepers in the world.",
      "“A lot of people said this season, probably not up to the standard of the previous two years, but still one of the best goalkeepers in the world.",
      "“You've got to have a strong spine in any football team. If you get the goalie right, you get a couple of strikers in, Bruno's going to be staying now. It's a great start to the transfer window for them.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United could shell out millions this summer as they look to get some of their unwanted stars off their books. The likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony are looking for ways out of Old Trafford - but the Red Devils could end up paying to offload them.",
      "Alongside Rashford and Antony, Jadon Sancho was also loaned out last term but the trio are now back in Manchester. They all fell down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim and he's offered no indication that he wants to bring them back into the fold.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was left out of the starting XI to play in the Europa League final and has since angered club bosses by wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name whilst on holiday.",
      "But potential buyers - or loan destinations - know that United want to get the players off their books and are ready to exploit that situation, reports the Telegraph.",
      "Garnacho, Rashford and Antony have contracts until 2028 - with United now expected to subsidise wages even if they leave the club and are playing for a rival. Jadon Sancho will again be allowed to leave after loans in the last two seasons.",
      "United will look to negotiate “salary recovery” from loan deals for their players, but the clubs eyeing their individuals believe their bargaining power has been massively dented by the fact they clearly want those players off their books.",
      "Rashford wasn't included in matchday squads in the weeks leading up to his Villa loan last season. He saw his performances increase at Villa Park and he's made it clear that he wants to move to Barcelona, but their priority appears to be signing Nico Williams.",
      "Antony produced his best football for years when he moved to Real Betis, helping them reach the Europa Conference League final. He won individual accolades and the Spanish side are keen on having him on a permanent basis. Last term they paid 84 percent of his salary.",
      "Garnacho has been told he can find a new home - and then proceeded to put up a picture on social media of him in a rival shirt. Chelsea were previously linked with his services as were Napoli.",
      "Manchester bosses have continued to sign players on big wages over the past decade, which has backed them into a corner when it comes to offloading those who failed to deliver.",

      "Mbeumo has expressed his desire to move to Old Trafford, despite interest from other clubs.",

      "United completed the £62.5m signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves as their first deal of the summer transfer window and Mbeumo would further strengthen Ruben Amorim's attacking options.",
      "Mbeumo is about to enter the final year of his Brentford contract, although the London club have the option of triggering a one-year extension in his deal, which helps their bargaining power.",
      "United would like to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo as soon as possible so he can report for the beginning of pre-season at Carrington, which is scheduled to begin on July 7."

      "Good morning and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, June 30.",
      "We are at the start of a new week and on the cusp of a new month which will see the Reds return to action in pre-season friendlies. Between now and then, Ruben Amorim will be looking to complete some good business to help bolster his team.",
      "Over the weekend, a new option to improve United's attack was made available when Dominic Calvert-Lewin announced that he would be leaving Everton on a free transfer. Unsurprisingly, he was linked to Old Trafford almost immediately.",
      "Elsewhere, the links to Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez continue to be strong with the goalkeeper reportedly favouring a switch to United. If he were to move to Manchester, Andre Onana's future would be in doubt as the club's No.1.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Onana has been informed that he will be staying at Old Trafford but whether this will still be the case should Martinez join the club remains to be seen.",
      "Keep across all the latest United transfer news and analysis in our live blog updates below...",
      "According to Caught Offside, there is a growing belief that Gyokeres will be leaving Sporting this summer despite the drama surrounding his future.",
      "It is understood that United, along with Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Barcelona and PSG are all being informed of the current situation surrounding the striker.",
      "While Sporting are attempting to fight for a good deal, it is felt there is a consensus that he will eventually depart.",
      "United are continuing their talks with Brentford over the signing of Bryan Mbeumo after a second bid was rejected.",
      "MEN Sport understands that the second bid was in excess of £60m but this still fell short of the Bees' valuation.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to sign for United and the Reds are working hard to make that happen.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "If things could not have got any more difficult between Gyokeres and Sporting, their president has come out and tried to justify his valuation of the striker by attacking United's business.",
      "Frederico Varandas explained, as quoted by The Mirror:",
      "We have been watching the market and I saw [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, leave for €65million (£55.5m). I saw Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both forwards but who, in my opinion, do not have Viktor's market value or quality, being negotiated for around €75million (£64m). Given the demands we consider fair, I believe Viktor could leave – unless he has the worst agent in the world, which is hard for me to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.",
      "Speaking during the last England camp where Toney was recalled for the first time since his move to Al Ahli, the former Brentford striker insisted that he was never worried about receiving a call-up back to the national team ahead of the World Cup.",
      "You see with me I think if you're just doing the right thing, playing football, playing well and scoring goals - a striker's job, that's what you're in a team to do - it doesn't matter where you play in the world, I feel like you should still get the chance. I think it's been proven me being me being back here and being back amongst the boys. It feels good to see the faces again and it feels good to get stuck in.",
      "According to reports in Spain, United are ready to make an offer for former Brentford striker Ivan Toney which would see him return to the Premier League.",
      "The 29-year-old scored 30 goals for Al Ahli this season and this is believed to have caught the eye of United.",
      "It is claimed that United are willing to make a £29.9m offer to bring Toney to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "With Arsenal seemingly switching their focus to Ekitike, United could be able to move in for Gyokeres this summer.",
      "It is widely believed that Gyokeres is looking to go on strike to force a move from Sporting.",
      "The Swede is believed to be angry that Sporting's president has, in his eyes, rowed back on his promise of selling him for a certain price.",
      "Fabrizio Romano understands that Gyokeres has no current plans to return to Sporting at the beginning of pre-season.",
      "Despite already competing with Liverpool and Chelsea for the Eintracht Frankfurt centre-forward, United now have new competition for Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Sport Bild understands that Arsenal have 'suddenly' entered the race for the centre-forward.",
      "It is claimed that Ekitike is a serious option at the Emirates Stadium should they miss out on the signature of either Gyokeres or Sesko this summer.",
      "His asking price could be a dealbreaker for the Gunners though with Eintracht currently insisting on £85m.",
      "On paper, Calvert-Lewin is the type of striker that Amorim will want.",
      "At his best, he is quick, aggressive and can hold the ball up in the offensive third. However, his stats last season make him a huge gamble.",
      "While a lot of his campaign was disrupted due to a hamstring injury, Calvert-Lewin scored just three Premier League goals before his enforced break.",
      "The season before that, he only managed eight goals in all competitions and he has not hit double figures since his impressive 2020/21 Covid hit campaign which saw him bag 16 goals in 33 Premier League games.",
      "He is hardly, at this stage, the prolific goalscorer that Amorim is looking for and at 28, you fear he may not have the years left to reach those previous peaks.",
      "Currently, it appears that Calvert-Lewin could affectively move to any club in this summer transfer window.",
      "Bookmakers bet365 are not committing firmly to any given club with any great strength but United are listed as joint favourites alongside Newcastle at 6/1.",
      "This weekend, Calvert-Lewin confirmed that he would be leaving Everton at the expiry of his contract.",
      "In his statement, the striker refused to acknowledge where he will be moving next but did suggest he was eager for a new challenge.",
      "The choice to move on was not simply about me - it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together. We believe it is the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn’t lessen the bond I’ll always have with Everton.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this Monday morning.",

      "\"We have already passed the stage where we had to sell our best assets. We do not have to sell him. In the same way that we do not have to sell him, we are still sensitive to Viktor's dreams.",
      "\"Sporting has a commitment, made by the president, not to ask for the value of the termination clause and to be reasonable in relation to Viktor 's performance last season.",
      "\"If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave. In the last few weeks, we have been keeping an eye on the market, I saw a player like [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for €65million.",
      "\"I saw two players being sold in the Premier League, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion, were sold for around €70million.",
      "\"We are talking about players who are 26-years-old. So, given the demands we are making in relation to Viktor's value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe.",
      "\"I won't say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent. But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60m plus €10m. Viktor already knows and I want Sporting fans to take advantage of this summer, in which they are two-time champions, in which they have a double, to celebrate, to be calm, because there are only two scenarios.",
      "\"One club respects the price requested by Sporting and Viktor will fulfil his dreams, and from that moment we will be ready to attack the targets, or that club does not want Viktor and Viktor, with a three-year contract, stays at Sporting and we will be very happy.",
      "\"I have been in football for 20 years and have already experienced countless transfer dramas. The transfer window is a cure for any ill. Disgruntled players are not a problem. Viktor staying will not be a problem for us, it will be a problem for our opponents.\"",

      "Everyone in the Premier League is aware that Manchester United are in desperate need of at least one striker this summer before the new campaign begins.",
      "This season, the strikeforce of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee was always going to be a risk and it proved to be one which backfired. Having failed to reach double figures in the Premier League, combined, the lack of goals in this squad is a huge problem and one which even Ruben Amorim has addressed publicly.",
      "As we enter July on Tuesday, United edge closer to the return of pre-season and all the perils that come with that. The plan would have been, and still is, to sign a striker preferably before the clash with Leeds on July 19 or, at the very least, before the start of the Premier League campaign against Arsenal less than a month later.",
      "In an ideal world, the man Amorim would target for that position is Viktor Gyokeres and, on the surface, the Swede seems like a sensible bet. He wants to leave Sporting Lisbon this summer, has scored bags of goals and has a pre-exisiting relationship with Amorim in this system.",
      "However, the reality makes a move for him a lot more difficult. Over the weekend, United were inadvertently drawn into the saga when Sporting's president Frederico Varandas took a dig at their business to try and justify his price tag for the striker.",
      "\"We have been watching the market and I saw [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, leave for €65million (£55.5m)\", he explained. \"I saw Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both forwards but who, in my opinion, do not have Viktor's market value or quality, being negotiated for around €75million (£64m).",
      "\"Given the demands we consider fair, I believe Viktor could leave – unless he has the worst agent in the world, which is hard for me to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.\" Varandas has previously stated that a fee of more than £70m will be needed to see them part ways with their striker.",
      "Record has since reported that Gyokeres has sent a text message to Varandas expressing his outrage and insisting that he will not be returning to Sporting next month for the start of pre-season. While it may seem that United are edging closer to seeing Sporting buckle, they cannot afford to waste time.",
      "The pre-season fixtures will be upon us before we know it and already the teams that should be United's rivals are completing their big business. Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea have all made key signings and you feel that United could be left at a disadvantage if they are sucked into a saga that currently has little to do with them.",
      "That is not to say that United should be rushing their business. For instance, although Dominic Calvert-Lewin is free, he is not necessarily the answer to United's problems.",
      "But they should be looking at other centre-forward targets who they could sign quickly to help bolster this squad. Gyokeres would be an ideal signing for United but if they are not willing to match the current asking price, the Reds need to move on instead of clutching to the hope that the Portuguese giants will alter their stance.",
      "Failure to do this could lead to United slipping behind their rivals."

      "Onana was signed for over £47million in 2023 under Erik ten Hag to replace David de Gea. The Cameroonian international has endured a mixed first two years at United with some high-profile errors hindering his reputation.",
      "Last season, Amorim dropped Onana from the starting 11 after he was at fault for both goals in the Europa League quarter-final draw against Lyon. He returned after sitting out of the Newcastle game but was slammed for failing to save Brennan Johnson's winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Now, The Sun are reporting that United are now open to sanctioning a loan move for Onana due to his high wages making a permanent exit tricky to construct. The report adds that United are now awaiting approaches for the goalkeeper and would prefer to send Onana to Europe.",

      "The same cannot be said of Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, with the club hoping to move all four players on this summer.",
      "The performance levels alone of Rashford, Antony and Sancho make their likely sales understandable. Antony and Sancho have never threatened to reach the heights expected of them at Old Trafford, while Rashford has been far too inconsistent in recent years. But Garnacho's situation is slightly different.",
      "While the 20-year-old is still raw and can be inconsistent, that's to be expected given his age. He is one of the few players in the United squad capable of producing something out of nothing, and so United's willingness to move him on this summer has seemingly come about purely because of his attitude problems.",
      "It's a statement of intent from Amorim. Garnacho's outburst following the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham shouldn't be tolerated, and his show of support for the exiled Rashford on social media last week wasn't a good look.",
      "There is absolutely no doubt about Garnacho's talent, and he's only going to get better as he develops. But, as Roy Keane said in his ridiculous criticism of Bruno Fernandes earlier this season, \"talent is not enough\".",
      "Keane was wrong to criticise Fernandes but he was right to say that talent isn't enough to represent a club like Manchester United. Amorim needs a group of players with the right attitude and weeding out those who he doesn't believe have the attitude and professionalism needed to take United back to where they want to be is the first step on the road to recovery for United.",
      "If Garnacho is sold and he goes on to thrive elsewhere, there will no doubt be plenty of rival fans ready to point out what a massive mistake United made. But that's not the point.",
      "Amorim is well aware of Garnacho's talent, but the United head coach needs to lay down a marker and let players know what is expected of them if they're to represent a club of United's stature.",
      "Selling Garnacho might not be a popular decision among some United supporters, but it's absolutely the right decision if Amorim is to get this group of players to where he wants them to be."

Ruben Amorim's arrival saw Ugarte play a much more prominent role, but he struggled during his first season in England and was an unused substitute for the Europa League final.",
      "Casemiro's European football renaissance made him an automatic pick for the Europa League final, with Bruno Fernandes chosen to play alongside the Brazilian. Fernandes is expected to play in midfield next season, but United's failure to qualify for Europe next season means Casemiro is unlikely to see much game time given his inability to keep up with the pace of Premier League games.",

      "Something that has been constantly criticised when it comes to Manchester United's transfer business is their lack of speed in completing deals. This year, they cannot be accused of that.",
      "United finished the 2024/25 Premier League season in 15th, recording their worst finish since the league was formed in 1992. That was compounded by the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Pressure is on United to turn things around. Long are the days are Premier League titles being lifted into the air come May. Next season, Ruben Amorim has the task of returning the club as close to the top as possible.",
      "Fortunately, work has already been completed in doing that. After Matheus Cunha signed from Wolves for £62.5million, United have submitted two bids for Bryan Mbeumo and are expected to return with a third - and hopefully final - offer to sign the 25-year-old.",
      "All being well, the signing of Mbeumo will see United's total spend surpass £125million. Both Cunha and Mbeumo will come in for over £60m, last year, Leny Yoro's £52.18m was the most expensive acquisition.",
      "Four more players could still come and bolster Amorim's squad with a number of options already linked. If that happens, that's unclear right now. But there's encouragement from United's dealings already that they haven't done in years.",
      "Cunha came to United on the back of 15 league goals for Wolves and Mbeumo bagged 20. The two players were targets identified after stellar campaigns in the Premier League. Signing the league's better-performing players is something that Sir Alex Ferguson mastered and a strategy that has been overlooked in recent years.",
      "The last signing United made for a Premier League player was Mason Mount from Chelsea, a deal that hasn't proved its £55m fee. Before that, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Tom Heaton came on frees with Wout Weghorst and Martin Dubravka arriving on loan.",
      "United spent £145m to bring in Harry Maguire (£80m), Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£50m) and Daniel James (£15m) six years ago. Despite having his troubles, Maguire is the only one that has been a success. Before the defender moved from Leicester City, United's last big signing from the Premier League was Romelu Lukaku.",
      "The striker cost an initial £75m in 2017 from Everton and scored 27 goals in his debut campaign. Six months after the Belgian was snapped-up, Alexis Sanchez arrived from Arsenal and that didn't work.",
      "It's a strategy in the transfer market that United have avoided in spite of the remarkable history. Under Ferguson, some of the Scotsman's greatest-ever signings came from league rivals. Eric Cantona in 1992, Roy Keane in 1993, Andy Cole in 1994, Teddy Sheringham in 1996, Dwight Yorke in 1998, Rio Ferdinand in 2002, Wayne Rooney in 2004, Dimitar Berbatov in 2008 and Robin van Persie in 2012.",
      "There's also mentionable names for Louis Saka, Michael Carrick, Carlos Tevez, Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young. It's something that United used to get so right and have now lost their way with others benefitting.",
      "Jack Grealish, Declan Rice, Moises Caicedo, Virgil van Dijk, Wesley Fofana, Riyad Mahrez, Pedro Neto and Amadou Onana have all left Premier League teams for rivals in big moves. United have been nowhere near any of them.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo deals show a glimpse of United edging their way back into that circle. Links to Antoine Semenyo, Eberechi Eze, Ollie Watkins, Christopher Nkunku, Liam Delap and Jean-Philippe Mateta all point to them having no intention of overspending on Premier League unproven players.",
      "Players outside of England aren't terrible options. However, that market is so saturated that United and others are faced with paying over the odds for targets. The gamble is, sometimes, not worth the risk. Rasmus Hojlund, Andre Onana, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Donny van de Beek have been 'gambles' that have proved to be a waste of money.",
      "Signing the Premier League's best-performing players is a strategy United are finally returning to and it could very well see them become the juggernaut in the English transfer market."

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Arsenal\nFrom BILD, Arsenal have joined the race for the France striker, which suits Eintracht Frankfurt just fine. While they’re insisting on £85million, they need the market to look as busy as they can make it appear. And it does Arsenal no harm while they continue to barter with other clubs over other strikers.",
      "",
      "19) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe’re keeping this in the top 20 for now because, based on absolutely nothing whatsoever, we get the sense that something could happen here. Even if it’s just that Liverpool make a move upon which they are told to f*** all the way off. But selling Isak doesn’t have to be the end of the world for Newcastle.",
      "18) Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Liverpool\nThe word is that Liverpool could move for Hato if Palace don’t drop their asking price for Marc Guehi. If they do, they might have to beat Chelsea and Arsenal to it.\n17) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nArsenal’s ‘dream signing’, apparently. And it could be a go-er since the Brazilian has had his nose put out of joint by Real, and he’s asked to leave. Real have even lowered their asking price from £85million since it became clear absolutely no one was prepared to pay that much. But Arsenal could find themselves chucking a small fortune at Rodrygo.",

      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "",
      "15) Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle failed with an opening £45m offer for Elanga, with Forest apparently looking for £60million. Newcastle have sought to compromise but they aren’t making many inroads. Elanga might have to force the issue if he wants the move.",
      "",
      "14) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nSpurs and Arsenal are reportedly set to battle it out for the FA Cup-winning England star, who is unlikely to leave Palace for less than his £68m release clause. He’s not exactly an out-and-out left-winger but that’s probably where he’ll play for either team, and that’s a position of priority for the Gunners, while Spurs recently signed Mathys Tel permanently.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites… just.",
      "",
      "12) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal have already had one bid rejected for the Spain Under-21 centre-back but they aren’t done. A second round of talks is scheduled but given the speed at which Arsenal are working this summer, we hold little hope of a swift resolution.",
      "",
      "11) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nEven if Sesko is the man most wanted at Arsenal, the Gunners see an opportunity to get more bang for their buck with Gyokeres. The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "10) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United.",
      "",
      "7) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "6) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – and now Quansah has done his bit for his country, a move should be wrapped up this week.",
      "",
      "5) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "3) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Chelsea\nThis one moved fast over the weekend, when Newcastle and Chelsea both had bids rejected before the Blues went back with something more acceptable to the Seagulls. Apparently, the Brazilian will undergo a medical in the the United States before joining Enzo Maresca’s Club World Cup squad.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. A medical is in the offing, if it hasn’t already happened.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London a week ago to complete his move, but Arsenal won’t be rushed this summer. This week, surely…",
      "at long last, the midfielder was in London a week ago to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "The crisis baton is passed and often shared between Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, whose competence levels have rarely converged over the last decade. Yet they remain far and away the richest clubs in the Premier League with the clearest in-built advantages.

Diego Simeone is their ace, their only feasible edge in any transfer race competed on even footing against other Champions League regulars. And he is going nowhere, probably even when Arsenal come calling.",

      "12) Napoli\nThe lure of sitting under the Scott McTominay learning tree cannot be sniffed at but there is a definite elephant in the room when it comes to Napoli’s transfer lure.",
      "Antonio Conte is simultaneously their biggest pull and most prominent red flag for prospective signings. Napoli have won Serie A twice in three seasons but with a managerial ticking time bomb liable to go off any time soon, and the volatile Aurelio De Laurentiis still in a position of power, it would be a risk to join even with their renewed offering of Champions League football.",

      "Dortmund cannot even lay consistent claim to being the country’s perennial bridesmaid. They have finished 3rd, 4th or 5th more often than they have 2nd in the last nine Bundesliga seasons.",

But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",
      "",
      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, Christian Chivu has a rebuild on his hands and it ultimately tends to come down to money; Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles too.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these constant near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through, as evidenced by this summer splurge.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against has been meticulously erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "But if Arsenal are to go just one better this time, they’re surely going to need another entry in this list of the top 10 signings ever made by Premier League clubs in response to a second-place finish.",

      "Since the minute they brought Fernandinho to Manchester, City have been scouring the planet for his replacement.

Kalvin Phillips, it turned out, was not quite the replacement Pep Guardiola had in mind.",

That was a non-starter for United, who simply upped their offer to £12.6million.",
      "Yorke told Gregory that he wanted to go. “If I had a gun, I would have shot him,” said Gregory, who signed Dion Dublin as a replacement before proclaiming of Villa: “We now have a squad with the depth to challenge for the title.”",

      "Not a bargain then, but still value. A signing that sits alongside the likes of Alisson and Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool: hugely expensive but entirely necessary and correct. The exact player needed in the exact position needed to maintain and improve a challenge against the City machine. And in Rice’s case now, also against the likes o[f Alisson and and Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool. Will it be third time lucky?",

      "“I cannot understand what is going on. I have not spoken to anyone who, when £18.6million became available, would have spent that on Michael Carrick.”",
      "That was the reaction in 2006 of Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters’ Association to the news that the Red Devils were signing Carrick to fill the void left by Roy Keane. Tottenham fans were similarly minded. Bernie Kingsley of Spurs fanzine Cock-a-Doodle-do gloated: “For that sort of money, and with midfielders like Tom Huddlestone and Didier Zokora at the club, it has got to be good business.”",
      "Indeed it was – for United. Carrick took Keane’s No.16 shirt and won the title in his first season with United. Then he won four more and everything else there was to win in 12 trophy-laden years at Old Trafford.",

      "6) Robin van Persie\nFuelled by losing the title in the final seconds of the 2011/12 season to their noisy neighbours, Sir Alex Ferguson began his Premier League last hurrah by taking Van Persie off Arsene Wenger’s hands, a switch for which he was never forgiven by Arsenal fans.",
      "Reflecting on his defection, the reigning PFA Players’ Player of the Year blamed ‘the little boy inside of me’ for turning his back on the Gunners. “That boy was screaming for Manchester United.”",
      "The boy in Van Persie’s head knew what he was talking about. The Netherlands striker was a revelation at Old Trafford, scoring 26 goals to earn the Golden Boot as United regained the title. Then Fergie retired and it all went to still-ongoing sh*t.",

      "5) Kevin De Bruyne\n“It takes a special player to improve our squad,” said Manuel Pellegrini in 2015 when City paid a club-record £55million for the Belgian, though few people really understood just how special De Bruyne was.",
      "Chelsea certainly didn’t spot it before they sold the Belgian to Wolfsburg for £16.7million a year and half before he returned to the Premier League to tear it up in a City shirt.",
      "It took De Bruyne three seasons to win his first title winner’s medal, which came a year after Pep Guardiola rocked up at the Etihad. Since then, he’s won five more to add to a Champions League, five League Cups and a couple of FA Cups.",

      "4) Sol Campbell\nEven if Campbell’s free transfer had been a disaster, it would have been worth the £100,000 spent per week on the defender’s wages just for all the p*ss it boiled across north London.",
      "But Wenger’s swoop for the England centre-back was actually a masterstroke. Campbell was a perfect replacement for Tony Adams and his arrival was the catalyst for Arsenal to end three seasons of living in Manchester United’s shadow as the bridesmaids of the Premier League.",

      "3) Didier Drogba\nRoman Abramovich took a year or so after buying Chelsea in 2003 to get his feet under the table before really splurging. Finishing as runners-up to Arsenal’s Invincibles in 2003/04 wasn’t enough for Claudio Ranieri to keep his job so Jose Mourinho was appointed immediately after he’d led Porto to the Champions League.",
      "Following Mourinho – Petr Cech and Ricardo Carvalho too – through the door was Drogba, who joined from Marseille for a club-record fee of £24million. Abramovich flexed his financial muscle by offering OM double what Juventus were prepared to pay. It was money extremely well spent.",
      "Drogba went on to score 164 goals in 381 appearances across two spells with the Blues. The Premier League title in his and Mourinho’s first season was the first of four for the Ivorian, who also won four FA Cups, three League Cups and the Champions League.",
      "",
      "2) Alan Shearer\nNewcastle blew up spectacularly in the 1995/96 title race, chucking away a 12-point lead to allow Manchester United to win the title and, subsequently, the Double. But the Toon won the summer transfer battle for the previous season’s top scorer…",
      "Shearer bagged 31 goals for seventh-placed Blackburn who allowed the striker to move on for a British record transfer fee of £15million. United and Newcastle were both willing to cough up so it was a straight choice for the England centre-forward.",
      "“I had to make a decision and at one point, I was 90 per cent certain I was going to go to Manchester United,” he reflected in 2020. “But then I got another call from Kevin Keegan and I thought ‘I’m going to go to Newcastle, it’s a club I’ve supported all my life’.”",

      "",
      "10) Burnley – £46.81m\nThere has been a slew of converted loans and then the first ‘new’ signing has arrived in the form of goalkeeper Max Weiss, perhaps precipitating James Trafford’s move to Newcastle. Quickly followed by the improbably named Quilindschy Hartman.",

      "",
      "8) Brighton – £51.3m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos, and the 21-year-old Diego Coppola.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "The Red Devils have already secured the signing of Matheus Cunha to bolster Ruben Amorim’s attacking options after triggering his £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves and have been pushing to add Mbeumo to their ranks after the Frenchman’s 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "Brentford rejected an opening bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons from United and then knocked back an improved offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons on Friday.",
      "It’s thought the Bees are holding out for £65m for their prized asset, who has reportedly told the club that he wants to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims United ‘remain confident’ and are planning to ‘improve’ on their latest proposal.",
      "Romano said: “Let me repeat once again that Man United remain confident, Man United remain optimistic. They still don’t have an agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, but the conversation is still ongoing.",
      "“Manchester United, according to my sources, are prepared to improve that proposal. It’s not just about numbers. It’s not just about the transfer fee.",
      "“It’s also about the structure of the deal, payment terms, installments, also add-ons, [if they are] easy or difficult, how to activate it.",
      "“Man United are working on all these details of the deal in order to try reach an agreement with Brentford.”",
      "But that’s not the case according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who claim the United board see Brentford’s £65m demand as ‘excessive’, particularly as ‘other areas of the team also pending reinforcement’ and have therefore ‘moved quickly towards a more accessible option’ – namely, Ivan Toney.",
      "The Al Ali striker, who moved to the Saudi Pro League side from Brentford for £40m last summer, has ‘aroused interest’ at United as ‘they believe that his previous experience in the Premier League, his scoring sense and his physical strength make him a very valid bet to lead the attack’.",
      "The report claims that with his Transfermarkt value ‘dropping to £21m’, United have ‘put on the table an offer that could be very attractive of €30m [£26m] plus €5m [£4.3m] in add-ons’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The first contacts have already occurred both between the clubs and with the player’s environment, and from Old Trafford they are optimistic about closing the agreement in the coming days. Toney would welcome his return to the Premier League and even more so to defend the colors of a historic club like United.",
      "‘With this play, the English team not only seeks to avoid an excessive expense, but also to incorporate a striker with experience, hungry to compete again in the elite and with a profile that fits the style of play that they want to implement for the next campaign.’",
      "Manchester United have a rare chance to end a ‘vicious cycle’ with their transfers, while there is praise for Sir Lee Carsley and his ‘mustard’ England U21s.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer.",
      "According to reports, Brentford have set an ‘enormous demand’ for Bryan Mbeumo as Manchester United target the 20-goal forward.",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has reportedly informed his club and Tottenham ‘of his decision to sign’ for Manchester United, following a ‘trust’ suggestion relating to Thomas Frank.",
      "Manchester United and Brentford have agreed a fee for the transfer of Tottenham Hotspur transfer target Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have already reportedly made a ‘decision’ on their ‘next three signings’ after Bryan Mbeumo, with a ‘fee agreed’ for the Brentford star."

      "Man Utd remain on the lookout for a new striker this summer, but hopes of landing one of their long-standing targets appear to have taken a significant knock.",
      "While much of the attention has focused on the deals already done, including the signing of Matheus Cunha and ongoing talks with Bryan Mbeumo, the club still wants to strengthen up front following a poor goals return last season.",
      "There’s also rumours that the Red Devils are ready to sign another Juventus star once the PSR deadline passes.",
      "Just 44 Premier League goals from an underperforming side have left Rasmus Hojlund under scrutiny, and recruitment chiefs are actively exploring new options.",
      "One of those is Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, a player United have tracked for some time and who was again linked in the Italian press this week.",
      "Utd are said to be watching the situation closely, with Juventus believed to be open to sales in light of financial pressures and looming accounting deadlines.",
      "Earlier this month, there were reports of direct contact between the two clubs over a potential swap deal involving Jadon Sancho. While the validity of those claims remains unclear, it reflects the reality that Juventus are open to offers, especially ones that could help ease their wage bill or balance sheet.",
      "But Vlahovic, it seems, is not playing ball.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the 25-year-old striker has told those close to him that he has “no intention of moving, whatever the cost.”",
      "The Serbian international is heading into the final year of a lucrative contract that reportedly rises to €12 million for the 2025/26 season, a figure Juventus are keen to reduce, either through a new deal or a sale.",
      "So far, Vlahovic has rejected both options. Gazzetta report that the club offered him an extension on lower wages, but that too has been turned down.",
      "Instead, the striker plans to run down his contract and leave on a free transfer next summer, aiming to secure another sizeable payday elsewhere.",
      "The report paints a tense picture between the club and the player. The relationship is described as irreconcilable, and Juventus now face the very real prospect of seeing their £62 million investment walk away for nothing.",
      "Some believe the club may even consider freezing him out of the squad, referred to as the “Chiesa method,” if a solution cannot be found.",
      "His stance also complicates Juve’s pursuit of Lille striker Jonathan David. The Canadian is available on a free transfer, and a deal is said to be close, but club officials are reluctant to carry both his wages and Vlahovic’s.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are in ‘direct contact’ over a swap deal ‘solution’ with Serie A giants Juventus regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "Nottingham Forest have unexpectedly taken the lead to sign Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, with Arsenal and Man United also linked to the Serbian striker",
      "Arsenal have cleared the path for Man Utd to sign a new striker amid ‘injury concerns’ after the Red Devils’ ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the £67m man.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the camp of a European striker after they ‘approached’ the Red Devils for a transfer.",
      "Arsenal have been given hope that they can finally land long-term striker target Dusan Vlahovic for a very low fee, as Juventus have been unable to agree a new contract ...",
      "Arsenal may have had a breakthrough in their pursuit of a striker this summer as one of their January targets could be available at a cut price."

      "The Serie A giants paid around £42m for Luiz last summer and are now hoping to recoup that figure in full to avoid posting a capital loss.",

      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas claims Arsenal and Manchester United only have themselves to blame for missing out on a cut-price deal for Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Both Premier League clubs are chasing the Sweden international this summer and were recently dealt a blow after Varandas dismissed reported claims that Gyokeres had a gentleman’s agreement to leave the club for well below his £85m asking price.",
      "The Gunners are said to have had a bid of around £55m rejected for the 27-year-old while United wait to find out which of Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko will move to the Emirates before feeding on the ‘scraps’.",
      "Varandas has doubled down on his claim that Gyokeres ‘will not leave for €70m’ and cited the Arsenal and United transfers that have already been made or are set to be imminently confirmed this summer as the reason why.",
      "As quoted by the Portuguese media outlet A Bola, Varandas said: “Sporting is very calm about Gyokeres. Sporting does not need to sell Gyokeres.",
      "“We have already passed the stage where we had to sell our best assets. We do not have to sell him. In the same way that we do not have to sell him, we are still sensitive to Viktor ‘s dreams.",
      "“Sporting has a commitment, made by the president, not to ask for the value of the termination clause and to be reasonable in relation to Viktor’s performance last season.",
      "“If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave. We have been keeping an eye on the market, I saw a player like Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for €65 million (£55m).",
      "“I saw two players being sold in the Premier League – Matheus Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo – forwards who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion, were sold for around €70m.",
      "“We are talking about players who are 26 years old. So, given the demands we are making in relation to Viktor ‘s value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe.",
      "“I won’t say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent. But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60+€10 million. Viktor already knows and I want Sporting fans to take advantage of this summer, in which they are two-time champions, in which they have a double, to celebrate, to be calm.",
      "“There are only two scenarios: one club respects the price requested by Sporting and Viktor will fulfil his dream, and from that moment we will be ready to attack the targets, or that club does not want Viktor and Viktor, with a three-year contract, stays at Sporting and we will be very happy.”",
      "Man Utd have made an offer for an England international as Viktor Gyokeres’ future continues to be up in the air, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, it is a ‘matter of time’ before Viktor Gyokeres secures a transfer, while Arsenal and Manchester United have learned his ‘total cost’.",
      "We’re all tired of the Gyokeres or Sesko to Arsenal or Man Utd nonsense, but if we can just hang on the outcome looks set to be very, very funny.",
      "Gyokeres has come to an ‘agreement’ with Sporting over his transfer this summer while one ‘condemned’ Man Utd star is ‘set to stay’ after a shock U-turn.",
      "Arsenal are ‘in agreement’ with Viktor Gyokeres’ agent regarding his potential move to the Emirates, while the fee for Benjamin Sesko has been reduced.",

      "‘[Alejandro] Garnacho, Rashford and Brazil forward Antony have contracts until 2028, which United are now expected to subsidise even if they leave the club and are playing for a rival. Jadon Sancho will also be allowed to leave after loans in the last two campaigns.",
      "United will look to negotiate “salary recovery” from loan deals for their players, although intermediaries believe their ‘bargaining power has been undermined by clearly wanting players off their books.’",
      "That report has led Tottenham News to claim United are ‘ready to seal a Rashford agreement with Tottenham’ as United paying a significant portion of his wages would be the only way Daniel Levy would sanction the move, but Rashford may well wait for Barcelona.",
      "He may well be waiting indefinitely though as a report from Spanish outlet Nacional has claimed Flick ‘has been clear: there is no place for him if there are no departures’.",
      "It’s claimed Ferran Torres and Robert Lewandowski are ‘the two options’ who could leave to open the door for Rashford, but ‘both look complicated’ as neither player wants to leave the club.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘At Barça they value his [Rashford’s] profile, his offensive versatility and his experience, but Flick believes that, with the arrival of Nico [Williams], the attack is already covered, and he does not want to incorporate unnecessary players that complicate the balance of the locker room or the management of the group.",
      "‘The Barça coach has made it clear that he does not want an oversized squad, especially in attack. With Nico Williams, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Lewandowski, the offensive positions are more than covered. That’s why Flick has been categorical: Rashford could only arrive if a weight loss occurs first.’",
      "From Andrey Santos to Evan Ferguson, these returning Premier League loanees could make a real splash in the 2025/26 season – if they’re not sold first.",
      "Newcastle United are casting their net far and wide in the hunt for a new winger, according to reports.",
      "Newcastle have the ‘strongest interest’ in signing the Man Utd star this summer and are making ‘serious moves’ to beat Tottenham and other suitors to his signature.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have made a significant decision on Manchester United star Marcus Rashford as they are ‘keen on a loan deal’.",
      "According to reports, one proposed Manchester United transfer is off as a manager has ‘made the decision’ to ‘block’ his club from completing a deal.",
      "Marcus Rashford may be denied his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona as ‘heavyweights’ at the club are concerned over his dressing room impact."

      "“Dortmund are fighting for their player and do not want to sell him under any circumstances.”",

      "Reports earlier in the year had valued Nmecha at closer to €50m, but BILD now claim Dortmund would consider bids in the region of €28m (£24m), offering a potential window of opportunity for clubs like Utd, who are watching the market closely.",

      "A subplot to any move would be a potential family reunion of sorts. Nmecha’s brother, Lukas, recently joined Leeds United, and the two clubs are set to face each other in a friendly this July as well as in the Premier League next season.",

      "On the back of a day in which Football365 published entirely contradictory stories on Arsenal’s painstaking choice between Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres, with one ‘ready to sign’ a few hours before a report insisted the other ‘will sign’, we were just about ready to call time on a transfer window which still has 66 days left to run.",
      "We even saw Fabrizio Romano looking ever so slightly exasperated at having to explain that Gyokeres “didn’t say no” to Manchester United but also definitely didn’t say yes as if he was talking Red Devils fans down from a ledge, and he bloody loves this stuff.",
      "He knows as well as we do that it’s these sort of transfer sagas that keep him in multiple mobiles and whatever else he spends his money on, and essentially pays our wages. And this one really is a doozy: two big-name strikers; two Premier League giants; desperation on each and every side.",
      "There are multiple angles to approach it from, opportunities for nuance for those tricksy headline writers and therefore thousands upon thousands of transfer-obsessed eyeballs lapping up every last update, U-turn and plot twist.",
      "We both want it to rumble on so we can garner those sweet, sweet clicks and for it to stop immediately so we can write about something, anything besides. But even if we have to grin and bear it for several more weeks while our advertisers rub their hands with glee, with a goal-orientated mindset we can all take solace in the likely outcome being very, very funny.",
      "The thought of United feeding on Arsenal’s transfer ‘scraps’ is in itself delightful. But far better than that is the very good chance that one of Gyokeres or Sesko will flop while the other shines having either won or lost the race to sign for Arsenal.",
      "Both being held in such high regard means it would be funny no matter which of them flops at which club. Manchester United spending another £60m-odd on a striker to score no goals is funny. Better than that? Gyokeres being that striker having scored them at a rate of one every 84 minutes under the very same manager at Sporting. That would excellent.",

      "But not as excellent as Arsenal starting the season with the striker they’ve needed for half a decade before reverting to Kai Havertz come Christmas and then Mikel Merino when it comes to the Champions League punch in March, before we’re all treated to the revisionist pundits insisting they didn’t ever think a striker was the answer anyway.",
      "And that brings us to our ideal scenario. We want Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, after what may or may not have been but have certainly been reported to be several flip flops between the two strikers, to choose Gyokeres as their flop because a) he has very little sell-on value as a 27-year-old, b) their concerns over him scoring goals in a minor league would prove to be amusingly well-founded, and c) (and this is absolutely the main reason) he was Manchester United’s first choice all along.",
      "Even if Sesko somehow weirdly decided there was a different option after being snubbed by Arsenal and didn’t join the transfer market scavengers, we will have been well sated by Gyokeres being utterly terrible for the Gunners given they will have both chosen him and won a battle with United to secure his signature. That’s good stuff.",
      "But of course (and we appreciate that we’re asking too much and probably don’t deserve such joy) the absolute best-case would be for Gyokeres to be absolute balls for Arsenal and Sesko to bang goals for Manchester United as the second-choice striker for the second-choice club. *Chef’s kiss*",

      "Amorim then performed a U-turn and backed the midfielder to see out his contract at Old Trafford as he wants to retain leaders in his dressing room, and now – having earned a shock recall for Brazil by Carlo Ancelotti earlier this month – Casemiro now wants to stay as he believes he has a better chance of playing in the 2026 World Cup if he remains at United.",

Kepa Arrizabalaga is closing in on a move to Arsenal, youngster Mike Penders will leave on loan to continue his progression into a Thibaut Courtois regen, and Djordje Petrovic is surplus to requirements after a stellar campaign on loan at Strasbourg in France.",

      "RB: Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nThe majority of the Chelsea squad would be sold in an instant if a decent enough bid comes in. There are some exceptions like Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo, with the money the Blues would accept being at world-record level — which is never going to be offered.",
      "Disasi spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and frequently played right-back for them after doing so for Chelsea. He’s 27 now and clearly not wanted at Stamford Bridge. His Villa Park loan didn’t do much to increase his value, but the Blues will be confident they can flog him back to France, or maybe even Saudi Arabia if it comes to that.",

      "What does Liverpool know about PSR…?\nTo funstar andy:\nNo, Liverpool wasnt always top 5 or top 8 since the 1950s. Why, there’s a gigantic statue of Bill Shankly becos he won LFC the championship in 1962… the 2nd division championship (back when the top division was division one). We spent at least a couple years looking up from a lower division.",
      "And big 6? Maybe. For some periods of time.",
      "But after we were sold to Dumb and Dumber Hicks and Gillette, who proceeded to shave us bald (ok, cold joke), we almost went bankrupt in 2010. If FSG (then known as NESV) hadnt convinced RBS to sell us for £300mil, we’d have been in administration, booted to Champo division, with no guarantee that we’d be back. We most definitely werent big 6 back then, as recently as 2010, barely 15 years ago.",
      "We had Roy Hodgson for manager (whom Stevie G thot the world of, lol, whilst he was critical of Rafa for playing him in his most devastating position of 10 or RW or LW just not 8 or 6), who bought Mark Konchesky for LB. We were in relegation positions when Roy was finally sacked after half a season. We had Joe Cole, whom Stevie G compared to Messi in training, and whom we spent years part paying his salary to get him off our books. We had Milan Jovanovic as our big ticket free agent, porn star lookalike Andriy Voronin as 10, no kidding. And we cheered for david ngog who was an improvement. Torres couldnt wait to jump off the boat the moment he got healthy and better.",
      "2010. FSG brought us back. However tightwad fans think they are, i’d always be grateful to them. They literally brought us back from our darkest time in recent memory.",
      "I know u guys had mike ashley for 14 years from 2007 till 2021. That’s a terrible decade and half, bouncing between divisions. But trust me, u dont want to get anywhere near bankruptcy, the way we did. It was a time lfc could really have disappeared for good.",
      "So no, we werent always top 6 since the 1950s. We almost disappeared in 2010, not too long ago.",
      "As tightwad as fsg are, and as frustrated as i am with them sometimes, they’ve proven their financially prudent management works. The club is profitable and the asset value has risen from £300 mil in 2010 to £3-4bil today. All without investing the kinds of crazy sums that sugar daddies do. (Read: forest, everton). In net spend terms, we’ve been consistently 5th or below, outspent by other clubs below us. So it’s doable, with lots of luck, skill, hard work.",

      "And Danny, LFC NY (now London) made fair points about the desire of many (most, I’d say) Newcastle supporters to ignore or even venerate the club’s new Saudi owners. And I agree with him that there’s too much whining about PSR from our lot.",
      "Although neither is completely wrong, I think both of them are oversimplifying these matters.",
      "While it’s true that the ostensible reason for PSR was to prevent clubs from unsustainable and destructive spending, that hasn’t particularly worked. Everton is only one EPL club that’s been in financial hot water (and I’m not just talking points deductions) since the rules were introduced. Heck, Ruben Amorim was insisting that ManU was about to go bankrupt at the start of their current spending spree.",
      "Additionally, because I gather that the rules only apply in the EPL, they do nothing to protect the clubs below them, where we’ve seen a number of clubs in dire straits recently. Those are the clubs that need PSR.",
      "Anyway, given that PIF is the richest club owner in the world, what exactly are these rules protecting us from?",
      "I’ve always suspected that PSR rules were also intended to rein in the growth of player costs; if so, it has failed utterly, to the sorrow of us relative minnows.",
      "Whatever the “reasons” for PSR, their effect has been confusion and frustration for clubs and their supporters, as the rules have militated against long- term planning, particularly for clubs bouncing in and out of the UCL. Nobody, but nobody, wanted to sell Elliott Anderson; PSR made that happen. On the other hand, that ridiculous deal last summer might have been (for us) the result of counting unhatched chickens with the Tonali and Gordon buys, given the 2023-24 league table.",
      "And every Liverpool supporter should understand that they were already among the richest clubs in the world in 2013, no matter how long it had been since they’d won the league: 10th in the world, according to a 2014 Forbes article using 2013 data. This was also the year that Real Madrid replaced ManU as the world’s wealthiest club.",
      "Whether Liverpool’s earlier long domination of English football was a result of doing things “the right way” is an open question, as far as I’m concerned. How often were they able to throw their financial weight around with smaller clubs? A lot, I’m guessing.",
      "But still, I’m hugely ambivalent about PSR. It frustrates me on behalf of clubs like Newcastle and Forest. But by not allowing a club like Newcastle to buy a billion dollars worth of players this summer, they do prevent all clubs (except evidently Chelsea) from just buying success. That’s a good thing. And yet again, they have contributed to a concentration of wealth at the top. That’s bad.",
      "I think there are versions of PSR that really would work and be fair, but this version ain’t one.",
      "(Also, Danny was just wrong about our recent signings. This is our fourth consecutive window without a first- team signing. It’s not complete, and we’ll sign players, but I should think James, NUFC could be forgiven for calling 22 months two years.)\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

But then, as a City fan, there’s always going to be an element of “He would say that wouldn’t he?” Which is fair enough and, importantly, it was only one game. But the main takeaway I have from that article is that the new signings meant that City ‘purred.’ They did. And in a competitive game, not a pre-season friendly.",

      "My point is, don’t sweat the press nonsense. Wait for either the inevitable photo Op with player Z with pen in hand at a desk with his new CEO’s arm around his shoulder, or the equally inevitable shot of said player holding up his new shirt on the pitch with his name and squad number on it.",

      "I saw in your reporting of Ronado’s extended deal with Al Nassr that you described him as a veteran which I’m going to suggest is inaccurate. Might I propose the following labels for outfield player lifestages:",
      "Teenagers: Depending on potential, must be described as one of ‘prospect’ if they’re average, ‘sensation’ if they have moments of brilliance, ‘prodigy’ if they’re enigmatic and not from Europe and ‘wunderkind’ if they’re already pretty good and from Europe.",
      "Early 20’s: Depending on the club they’re at and how often they’re featuring and how well they’re performing must be described as ‘player’ if they’re average, ‘mercurial’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘middling’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘star’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Late 20’s: As above, but ‘journeyman’ if they’re average, ‘frustrating’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘dross’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘world class’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Early 30’s: As above, but ‘experienced’ if they’re average, ‘unfulfilled potential’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘stealing a wage’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘a wise head’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Mid-late 30’s: As above although by now there are only two types, ‘veterans’ if they’re average but reliably so and ‘legends’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "After the late 30’s is no time for professional outfielders to be seriously playing and so the only labels available are ‘sad geriatric’ if they’re clogging around at the base of the league pyramid, probably doing so in the number 43 shirt because 4+3=7 and they used to wear 7 or ‘delusional egomaniac’ if they’re still clinging on in any kind of credible league while demanding a single digit squad number.",

      "I’d normally edit this down before sending it in, but during this period of off-season somnolence, I reckon you’re desperate enough to print it in full. So fair warning: it’s long.",
      "There’s an often-discussed feeling many of us can relate to: when that little-known band you follow suddenly make it big, when that book you enjoyed years ago gets made into a lavish HBO series and everyone is talking about it, or when that under-18s player you’ve been tracking through youth tournaments and reserve appearances steps up to the first team and bosses the midfield like a seasoned pro. Probably the Germans have a word for it: that mixture of pride, satisfaction, excitement, smugness, but also an indefinable sense of loss, as the special thing which was known only to yourself and a few other obsessive nerds goes mainstream. Now national journalists are writing in-depth columns about this exciting new thing, and the most basic of armchair fans is telling you, ‘Oh I really like so-and-so, have you heard of them?’",
      "There have been many heartwarmingly hilarious things about Man Utd’s decline over the last decade-plus: Moyes, Fellaini, Pogba, Ed Woodward, Antony. The club has been like a clown car that just keeps giving out: every time you think enough daftness has emerged from that apparently-finite-sized vehicle, out pops another grinning idiot in polyester wig and enormous shoes, tripping over his own feet and crashing into lampposts.",
      "But spare a moment’s thought for the ABU. Utd’s continued dedication to wringing the neck of their own legacy has turned everyone not born within 30 miles of TTOD into a loud, proud member of the ABU gang. ABUism has gone mainstream. I’ve been growing a touch concerned by how easy it is for this new generation to flaunt their Utd-baiting credentials, so I’m going to offer some important historical context to the younger ABUers out there.",
      "READ: Newcastle blame Manchester United, makes Rashford U-turn and launch worst £125m ‘triple-swoop’ ever",
      "You see, ABUism didn’t used to be so easy. I know this will shock some, but back in the day, Man Utd were good; and when they weren’t good, they were lucky, and when they weren’t good or lucky they were still twice as rich as everyone else. Being an ABU in those days was lonely work. As Man Utd hoovered up title after title, with one of the most stubborn managers in history helming every aspect of the club with iron authority, us ABUs were the laughing stock of school playgrounds and pub saloons up and down the country. Where to turn, for the humiliated ABU, as Utd win the league with 79 points? How do you maintain your dignity, when Utd have just won three league titles in a row and another UCL on top, and we’ve stopped even bothering to count the FA and league cups?",
      "In those days, us ABUs had to nurture the flame of our passion quietly, even secretively. I grew up in suburban south London, where Man Utd ‘supporters’ were ten-a-dozen. Being an ABU in those circumstances was not easy, but for some of us, it was never a conscious choice. My dad was an ABU; his dad was an ABU. Cut me open and I bleed ABU. To this day, my old man proudly recounts the tale to anyone who’ll listen of how my mum tried to put a red dummy in my mouth and I spat it on the floor. ‘Fuck United!’ I babbled, and these were my very first words.",
      "Back when Utd were so good they were inevitable, being an ABU meant something. For many Utd supporters, That Night in Barcelona stands as the greatest moment in their sporting lives; and in a way it was for me, too, but for entirely opposite reasons. As I sat in the bosom of three generations of my ABU family, and together we watched that Norwegian goblin prod the ball home for the most undeserving winning goal in the history of sport, and wept as those scarlet-bibbed idiots celebrated in a sweaty Manc pile, I knew I belonged: the passionate, white-hot hatred I felt was meaning, purpose, identity, community. The very next morning, my old man and I got matching tattoos: a camp little devil being sodomised by a Kaiser Wilhelm-style old dude. The devil screams his safe word: ABU! ABU! But Kaiser Wilhelm is just laughing and sodomising, laughing and sodomising. My girlfriend has begged me to get this tattoo lasered off (it’s in a very particular, usually-covered place). I’ve told her repeatedly: I love you, you’re my soulmate, we’ll grow old together. But I would sooner die than erase this part of myself.",
      "It was a tough, brutal time, and sometimes you had to defend your ABU beliefs with your life. But it inculcated a defiance, a determination to persist. We were hacking through the tough times towards those longed-for sunlit uplands. And now – here we are. The sunlit uplands are everything we hoped for: bountiful, nourishing and, most importantly, hilarious. Every year, Utd find new depths of ineptitude to plumb. Every year their rhetoric grows more and more detached from reality. Every year they circle closer to the holy grail, the utopia of relegation. And yet, something feels slightly off, for me at least. I look around at the happy faces of the new, young breed of ABUs, those who’ve never known anything but success, never known first-hand quite how terrifyingly omnipotent Utd can be. I meet the eyes of my fellow lifelong ABUs, those of us past 35ish years old, and I see old scars lurking beneath the merriment. Are there enough of us still standing? Some, it is true, have started to abandon the battlefield, wearied by the fight. They say they feel sorry for Utd, that the Prem needs a strong Utd to make it competitive. Let them go: we don’t need them. But those of us who remain are constantly totting up the numbers, evaluating the condition of our fellow warriors. The young’uns are untested in the theatre of war, so how trustworthy are they really? What if, against all reason, sense and logic, Amorim’s plan starts to bear fruit? What if Mbuemo and Cunha turn Utd into the most potent attack in the league? What if they raise north of £200m selling Onana, Maguire, Mainoo, Antony, Sancho, Rashford and Hoijlund, and reinvest it efficiently and effectively? What if, revitalised, they start chasing down Liverpool, Arsenal and City? If Utd rise again, will the new generation of ABUs have the grit to see it through? Or will they, like so many previous generations of Surrey-based milksops, fold under the pressure and start claiming, ‘Well I’ve supported them since my dad drove past the Trafford Centre once in 1976’?",
      "I didn’t mean for this to develop into an ‘aging-man-gets-angry-at-the-modern-world-as-it-races-away-from-him’ diatribe. I don’t want to denigrate the young’uns out there, taking their first steps into the world of ABUism. But I just want them to know – if any of them have put down their Tiktoks long enough to read this far – that it wasn’t always this easy to laugh at Man Utd. For two decades, it was really bloody difficult, actually. And despite the absolute calamity of the last few years, the club remains rich enough and prestigious enough to mount a comeback. So it might happen. If that day comes, me and the other OGs are gonna be out here, standing tall, the old defiance rekindled, ready to ride again. Can we rely on you youngers to stand alongside us, even as Utd drop £250m on a 28-year-old Lamine Yamal and go on to win their second treble in two seasons?",

      "From Arsenal wonderkid Myles Lewis-Skelly to Barcelona and Spain sensation Lamine Yamal, these are the 10 highest-paid teenage footballers in the world, with one earning nearly £440,000 a week.",
      "",
      "10) Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – Undisclosed\nCards on the table, we have no idea what Lewis-Skelly is on. What is for sure is that he’s among the highest-paid teenagers in the world. His new five-year contract is almost certainly worth somewhere between £25,000 and £100,000 per week. If we were to guess (and it’s nothing more than a guess), we’d say he’s taking home £50,000 a week. That’s more than £2.5m annually.",
      "MORE: The Famous F365 Friday Quiz: Wonderkids edition…",
      "",
      "=8) Marc Guiu (Chelsea) – £50,000 p/w\nThe most baffling inclusion in this teenage rich list. Chelsea were obviously willing to offer Guiu big money due to his low transfer fee (€6million) and the fact he’s tied down until 2029.",
      "",
      "=8) Oscar Bobb (Manchester City) – £50,000 p/w\nWe reckon Bobb is just about more deserving of his hefty wage, but his City future is uncertain after a lengthy injury.",
      "",
      "7) Pau Cubarsi (Barcelona) – £64,917 p/w\nOne of two Barcelona players here, Cubarsi committed his future to his boyhood club on a four-year deal worth €4million per year.",
      "",
      "6) Lucas Bergvall (Tottenham Hotspur) – £65,000 p/w\nSpurs beat Barcelona to the signing of Bergvall and all of a sudden, it makes perfect sense.",
      "",
      "5) Endrick (Real Madrid) – £67,513 p/w\nBrazilian wonderkid Endrick is Real Madrid’s highest-earning teenager, taking the mantle from Arda Guler, who left his teenage years behind in February. We’re looking forward to discovering how much Franco Mastantuono is earning.",
      "",
      "4) Archie Gray (Tottenham Hotspur) – £75,000 p/w\nMathys Tel earns £80k a week at Spurs, but he turned 20 in April, so the Londoners’ only have two representatives. Pathetic.",
      "Gray cost around £40m last summer, leaving boyhood club Leeds United.",
      "",
      "3) Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – £115,000 p/w\nSigned from Lille last summer, French defender Yoro is the second-most expensive teenager in Premier League history and one of 15 United players on a six-figure weekly wage. They’re grateful to be cutting that figure down from 17 with Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen leaving for nothing.",
      "Top earner Casemiro, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are all available, while United also wouldn’t stand in the way of Harry Maguire, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee, Andre Onana or Luke Shaw leaving if suitable offers arrive.",

      "2) Warren Zaire-Emery (PSG) – £185,012 p/w\nThe French international penned a lucrative five-year contract in April 2024 to become the highest-paid teenager in the world. Now second, he takes home nearly £200k per week at PSG.",
      "",
      "1) Lamine Yamal (Barcelona) – £270,540 p/w\nComfortably the youngest on this list is also comfortably the highest-paid teenager in the world – and of all time.",
      "Yamal earns a base salary of £270,540 per week and a further £169,108 in bonuses, meaning he takes home £439,648 every bloody week, at the age of 17.",
      "He is under contract for seven years, meaning he’ll still be very young when it expires. It’s honestly frightening. Every single statistic about the Barcelona wonderkid makes me sick. And he could win the Ballon d’Or.",
      "PSG have won the Champions League, but will La Liga champions Barcelona still be recognised for having the world’s best players?",

      "Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford has commented on his ‘dream’ transfer, revealing two advantages with this next destination.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly put a ‘six-year proposal on the table’ in a bid to beat Chelsea to the £40m star as a role change for Myles Lewis-Skelly has been mooted."

      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."

      "United have, as expected, gone back in with another offer for Mbeumo after having their initial bid worth up to £55m rejected.",

      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."
