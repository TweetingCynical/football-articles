      "Arsenal forward Alessia Russo and Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone revealed the brutal nickname given to Lionesses and Manchester United starlet Grace Clinton",
      "If you're not the touchy-feely type, then Grace Clinton is one to avoid.",
      "That's the warning issued by Alessia Russo and Ella Toone, who revealed Clinton's infamous passion for hugs, even garnering a savage nickname for the Manchester United midfielder - \"sloth\".",
      "Clinton, 21, has relished a scintillating season while on loan from United to Women's Super League rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Under the guidance of highly-rated manager Robert Vilahamn, Clinton has exploded onto the scene as one of England's most exciting young midfield prospects.",
      "Her loan spell earned a call-up to Sarina Wiegman's senior squad and Clinton has not disappointed in the myriad opportunities presented to her.",
      "But where Clinton has honed a commendable reputation for her ball skills and reading of the game, she has also honed a reputation on camp as a hugging enthusiast.",
      "It's a zeal which few in the squad share, including long-time best friends and former United teammates Russo and Toone.",
      "\"Despite being best friends, we’re not really huggers,” Russo said on her new BBC podcast Tooney and Russo. “If I wanted a hug, I’d go to Grace Clinton.”",
      "“Oh yeah, everyone would go to Grace,” Toone concurred. “But sometimes she’s too much. Dangling off my neck, and I’m like, 'Grace!'”",
      "“Yeah, she’s just like a little sloth. That’s what I call her. She’s like a little puppy,” said Russo.",
      "\"There’s a lot of times where she’s hugging me and I’m not hugging her back,\" added Toone mirthfully. \"And it’s just a bit weird really but she loves it. She just doesn’t let go.”",
      "According to the Lionesses duo, Clinton's passion for zest for hugging is not exclusive to her teammates, or even humans.",
      "\"She said to me at the camp that’s just gone, she said, ‘Have you ever hugged a tree before?’” Russo recalled through laughter. “And I went, ‘No Grace, I haven’t. Have you?’ And she went, ‘Yeah, and I’m just going to do one later.’ We were going on a walk, she was like, ‘I’m going to hug one later as well.’ And I was like, ‘You’re such a weirdo!’”",
      "Neither Russo or Toone categorise themselves as huggers, despite their long-running friendship. Yet, Russo noted how long-time best friends and fellow Lionesses Keira Walsh and Leah Williamson are similar in the non-hugging nature of their friendship.",
      "“I was talking to Leah [Williamson] on camp and she was like, ‘That’s the same with her and Keira [Walsh],\" said Russo.",
      "“Yeah, I can’t imagine them ever hugging,\" said Toone.",
      "“But if I ever needed anything, you’d be the first person I come to,\" added Russo, to which Toone replied: \"I mean, if you were crying, I’d put my hand on your shoulder.”",
      "Clinton was an unused substitute in England's 2-1 loss to France on Friday night, with Toone getting the nod to start in the No 10 position in lieu of Lauren James - out due to a foot injury - and Georgia Stanway and Keira Walsh working behind in the double pivot.",
      "England laboured to produce significant sparks throughout the contest, with plenty of criticism levied towards Wiegman's reticence to use her bench.",
      "Whether Clinton is called on for Tuesday's re-match remains to be seen, though a need to offer something less predictable could twist Wiegman's arm.",
      "Asked whether sharing a hug with manager Wiegman was a \"no-go\", Russo and Toone laid down the protocol.",
      "\"It’s not a no go. If you first come to camp, you give Sarina a hug,” said Toone.",
      "“When you say hello, yeah,” Russo agreed. But Grace probably hugs for a lot longer than other people. Yeah, you know that person that just doesn’t let go? That’s Grace.”",

      "Jadon Sancho played the final game of his second spell with Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, with the German giants falling short in the Champions League final at Wembley",
      "Jadon Sancho has thanked Borussia Dortmund for welcoming him back as his loan spell with the club comes to an end.",
      "The Manchester United forward spent the second half of the season back with his former side, having been ostracised at Old Trafford following a falling out with Erik ten Hag. Sancho rediscovered his best form back in Germany and helped Dortmund to an unlikely Champions League final.",
      "The 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid at Wembley marked the final game of his temporary arrangement, with the 24-year-old's future now expected to be one of the major topics of the summer window. Mirror Football understands that Sancho, signed by United for £73million in 2021, would be open to rebuilding his career in Manchester, on the proviso Ten Hag is moved on this summer.",
      "But for now, Sancho is firmly focused on paying tribute to Dortmund, releasing a heartfelt statement to the club and their supporters following Saturday's showpiece in London. \"What a crazy 6 months @bvb09,\" he posted on social media.",
      "\"We win together we lose together, these moments only make us stronger! I’m so grateful to be apart of such an amazing group of players!",
      "\"I want to congratulate Real Madrid on winning the Champions League. We came up short on the night, but we should be super proud of ourselves. We are a family and these moments won’t break us! Thank you to everybody who came out to support us on such a special day!",
      "\"@BVB I want to thank everyone involved at such an amazing club. I can’t thank you enough for welcoming me back the way you all have during these last 6 months.",
      "\"Thank you to Edin Terzić, Sebastian Kehl and Hans-Joachim Watzke for believing in me and bringing me back. Finally a special thank you to the BVB fans. Your support is amazing and I’m forever thankful for you all!\"",
      "It is understood that Dortmund want to bring Sancho back to the club permanently, but United's price tag of more than £50million is almost certain to be a prohibitive one. That could see him returning to the Red Devils for the new season, although there is an acknowledgement that would be unlikely with Ten Hag in charge.",
      "The pair were at the centre of a public row in September of last year when Ten Hag claimed the forward was dropped from the squad thanks to poor training performances. Sancho hit back on social media claiming he was being made a 'scapegoat' by the under-pressure head coach.",
      "He failed to make another appearance for United before being loaned out in the January window. Ten Hag has recently suggested that his positive performances back at Dortmund were good in terms of keeping his value high.",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "However, it remains to be seen whether Ten Hag will still be the man making personnel decisions at Old Trafford, with United chief Jim Ratcliffe conducting a review of his performances. The Dutchman made the decision a little more difficult by lifting the FA Cup, but their worst ever Premier League season means his future is far from assured.",
      "The likes of Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Tuchel and Thomas Frank have all be touted as potential replacements, should Ratcliffe decide to move on from the ex-Ajax coach. That could yet open the door for a Sancho return after reminding people why United spent so much to bring him to the club in the first place.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson ensured the Manchester United dressing room never gave anything away, but there was one person who seemingly got away with telling stories about goings on inside the club",
      "Manchester United legend Brian McClair admits he could have been sacked by the club for the secret stories he used to write in his magazine column.",
      "During the Scot's time at the club, he would contribute to the monthly United magazine 'Inside United'. Sir Alex Ferguson also used to write his own column in the publication, but was predictably guarded about anything printed.",
      "McClair, 60, was rather less so, often using his platform as an opportunity to give fans a peak behind the United curtain, for better or for worse. From funny and embarrassing stories at the training pitches and the changing rooms, to secrets about the club as a whole, McClair – who was deemed by his team-mates to be a favourite of Fergie's – had little filter when it came to revealing information about United.",
      "When the former United forward looks back on the things he used to publish, even he admits he was lucky to have not been ousted from Old Trafford.",
      "When asked if he ever feared the sack for publishing the dressing room stories, on his podcast ‘Life With Brian’, the ex-United ace looked back on his little side-project and said: “I still don’t know how I managed it. Even if there was some favouritism going on, I still don’t know how, to this day, I managed to get away with some of the things I got away with. I still cast my mind back to some of the things that I did that were possibly sackable.”",
      "McClair went on to explain how his team-mates and other members of staff grew to love the column. Not only did they enjoy reading it, they even liked leaking their own little tales of life inside Old Trafford.",
      "“It’s not that I didn’t care, but I had nobody to be beholden to,\" McClair added. \"What was always in the back of your head, particularly with Ferguson, was that it could be your last interview.",
      "“I used to do a little diary in the United magazine which became quite popular which was mischievous. Some of it was factual, because people always wanted to know what was happening inside the dressing room and the training pitch and some of it was fiction.",
      "“When I wrote it, there would be a four-week lag before the magazine came out, so by the time the magazine came out, people had forgotten what I had written. Once or twice, I got hauled into the manager’s office, more when I was coaching than when I was playing.",
      "“It was to give me a row about some little, piece of thing, that I had written. The players couldn’t wait to tell you something they thought was funny that had happened in the dressing room, or the training pitch or whatever.\"",
      "Ferguson was known for ensuring everything at Old Trafford was watertight, in regard to dressing room leaks or other information about the team. The legendary manager was extremely protective about the club and his players, particularly when it came to information finding its way into the press.",
      "However, it appeared the former Motherwell and Celtic forward's form ensured he always stayed on Ferguson's good side. McClair contributed 118 goals and 16 assists in 450 appearances for United between 1987 and 1998.",
      "His most famous season was his debut campaign, which saw him score 28 goals in 46 appearances for the Red Devils in the 1987/88 campaign.",

      "Manchester United and England No 1 Mary Earps was forced off in the opening stages of England's 2-1 Euro 2025 qualifying loss to France on Friday night",
      "News that Mary Earps had withdrawn from the Lionesses squad ahead of a crunch Euro 2025 qualifier against France was met with shock from fans - but in the England dressing room, there was only calm.",
      "Earps, 31, was forced off during the reigning European champions' 2-1 defeat to France on Friday, the first match of a crucial double header against Herve Renard's group leaders.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper appeared to pull up with a hip injury within a minute of the match starting after dealing with a simple back pass from her defence. After attendance from the England medical team, the World No 1 attempted to play on but was eventually subbed off after being unable to proceed.",
      "Chelsea's Hannah Hampton replaced Earps, who eventually withdrew altogether from the England squad over the weekend as she deals with a minor hip injury.",
      "The loss of Earps was viewed as another significant blow on a difficult night for Sarina Wiegman's side, who laboured to show much spark against France without the mercurial talent of Lauren James, who was also forced to withdraw with a foot injury.",
      "Earps has been a stalwart in Wiegman's side since the Dutch manager arrived on scene and placed faith in the Nottingham-born shot-stopper, giving her a platform from which she swiftly established herself as one of the best keepers in the women's game.",
      "But the loss of Earps has not rocked the English dressing room as greatly as some might have suspected, with Bayern Munich midfielder Georgia Stanway attesting to the comparable quality and pedigree that Hampton brings between the sticks.",
      "\"“They're both great goalkeepers,\" Stanway said after Friday's loss. \"You can play either one of them and you know exactly what you're gonna get and I think that's what's special. Either one, you feel safe with them behind you and for an outfield player that's exactly what you want.\"",
      "Like Earps, Hampton too spent time away from the England set-up with her career stilted at a dubious crossroads. Yet, a move from Aston Villa to Chelsea last summer and faith entrusted her by ex-Blues boss Emma Hayes has since seen Hampton's career resurrected with eye-catching verve, resulting in Hampton's recall into the England national team.",
      "\"You can see the way that Hannah distributes the ball is world-class,\" Stanway said of the Chelsea No 1. \"The passes that she was making into full-back areas were unbelievable. To come on at [eight] minutes, it's completely different circumstances and within the first five she pulls off a save like that so that shows the type of goalkeeper she is.",
      "\"I know she's had her head down and she's been working really hard at Chelsea and she's got her place at Chelsea, she's been playing games. She deserved it tonight. Obviously, we hope that Mary is okay and she recovers well but like I said, you could play either one of them you know exactly what you're going to get because they’re both world-class.”",

      "Jaap Stam has been linked with a return to Manchester United as part of Erik Ten Hag's coaching staff, and former charge Chris Gunter has heaped praise on the tactician",
      "Jaap Stam has received gushing praise from one of his former stars amid talk of a potential return to Manchester United.",
      "The Dutch manager, who was a key part of the United's Treble-winning side in 1999, has been touted for a possible coaching role at Old Trafford. Stam, 51, is fondly remembered by Red Devils fans, having won three Premier League titles in as many years at the club before he was controversially sold to Lazio in 2001.",
      "And former Reading defender Chris Gunter believes his old manager would be a shrewd addition to Erik ten Hag's backroom team. The Wales hero spent two of his eight seasons with the Royals under Stam, who he referred to as \"the best club manager\" he's had the privilege of playing under.",
      "\"He was incredible,\" Gunter told Get Reading (via the Manchester Evening News). \"I was away in the Euros with Wales when he got the job at Reading and I was being told dates when I was meant to be back in. But when we kept going further and further in the competition it [my return] was getting pushed back. So all the boys were back in pre-season and we were still in France.",
      "\"There were a couple of times he would text and say good luck and a small thing like that - having a text from a manager saying good luck or well done shows they are keeping an eye on you. He was someone I had never met and looking back over time, I'm not really shocked because the way he was with the players, it probably came naturally to him.",
      "\"The way he was as a person and what he'd done in his career - he could have come to Reading, seen us as players and been on a different level because he has played at the top of the game. But the way he merged himself in to the standard of the players and the league was really impressive.\"",
      "Gunter made sure to add the caveat of \"club manager\" when ranking Stam so highly among his best bosses. The retired full-back – who started his career at Cardiff City before joining Harry Redknapp's Tottenham in January 2008 – was famously part of Chris Coleman's Wales team that reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016.",
      "He also played under another United legend in Ryan Giggs, who briefly took charge of Wales before stepping down following charges of assault against his ex-girlfriend, which he denied. However, none of those club bosses could compare with Stam in Gunter's eyes.",
      "Stam, though, recently dismissed the rumours circulating about a potential return to Old Trafford and told the Daily Mail there's been no contact with the club as of yet. However, he did leave some room for speculation as he added: \"If they want me to help them in any way as well, then I'm always ready to do so.\"",
      "The ex-Netherlands star has committed to coaching his childhood club, DOS Kampen, starting this summer. However, an opportunity to work at the Theatre of Dreams could well sway him away from his duties with the sixth-tier team.",
      "Gunter's evaluation paints Stam as a coach who knows how to establish strong connections with his squad. However, he also commended other aspects of his coaching style, noting the superb football Reading played under his stewardship.",
      "\"At time we'd blow teams away. There were a lot of times if it didn't work it was because of our passing, and if we'd lose it was the wrong way to go,\" added Gunter. \"But he would always say we're not changing we just need to do it better.\"",
      "\"There were times when we did overplay and it resulted in us losing a goal but the times when we did score from it... the highlights only show the final pass and finish, but the move actually started with our centre-backs which would never get picked up on. But we knew inside the club that it was because of what we were doing.\"",

      "David Beckham moved to Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2003 but was forced to heavily rely on one of his teammates at the Santiago Bernabeu",
      "Real Madrid legend Michel Salgado has revealed how he was tasked with looking after David Beckham when he arrived at the Santiago Bernabeu.",
      "The England captain boldly decided to join Real Madrid after a high-profile fallout with Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. In 2003, Beckham became the latest in a long line of Galacticos and appeared to be a perfect fit for the glamorous team assembled by club president Florentino Perez.",
      "While Beckham became an instant star attraction on the pitch, he initially faced problems acclimatising to his new life in Spain. Real Madrid icon Salgado has spoken about how he was made responsible for Beckham from his first day at the club.",
      "“He would call me every day, ‘Michel, let’s go for this, let’s go for that’. So it was a pretty good time. For me, it was good because I practised English. I did it with Macca [Steve McManaman] before and then I had Beckham so it was a good moment.”",
      "The team failed to deliver on its potential during Beckham’s time in Spain but did clinch the La Liga title in 2007. Beckham would go on to join LA Galaxy before retiring at PSG after two separate loan spells at AC Milan. He is now the owner of MLS side Inter Miami, who count a certain Lionel Messi among their ranks.",
      "As for Salgado, the full-back was once described as the “hardest person in the world ” and “a genuine psychopath” by McManaman.",
      "Have your say! Was David Beckham a success at Real Madrid? Tell us in the comments section below",
      "",
      "Perhaps the defender’s approach to the game came from his long-standing admiration for English football. He grew up learning the language with his sister-in-law from York and spent a month in Margate during his teenage years as an exchange student. It meant that when he was released from Real Madrid, he took the advice of ex-team-mates Ivan Campo and Fernando Hierro to join former Bolton manager Sam Allardyce at Blackburn Rovers.",
      "Salgado would spend three years at Ewood Park and backed Allardyce to replace Fabio Capello as England boss in 2010. “Who is better for England than an English manager who ­understands the English mentality and knows everything about the English game?” he asked. “He did a great job with Bolton. He is doing a great job with Blackburn Rovers.",
      "“You know the talent of the manager when he has a small batch of players and you are a competitive team. The job he’s done over the last few years has been magnificent. He is one of the reasons I came here to England.”",

And Carragher is confident his former club will continue to \"compete for all honours\" under Slot and not experience the same kind of drop-off United did when Sir Alex Ferguson retired.",

      "\"I don't think they had that structure at Man United when Ferguson left. It was the same with Wenger. They were old-fashioned football managers who ran everything and those days have gone.",

      "Arsenal aren't hanging about in their search for a new striker and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko has already said yes to what could be a £55million move to the Emirates. The Gunners also want to offload players in order to fund new signings, just as rivals Manchester United hope to do in co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's first transfer window.",
      "The departure of Bruno Fernandes would certainly drum up funds, with the United captain's agent reportedly in talks with Bayern Munich over a mega-money deal. Jadon Sancho could be joining him in Germany amid interest from Borussia Dortmund, although he'd be willing to play for the Red Devils again if they decide to sack Erik ten Hag.",

      "The winger has drawn interest from Ipswich, the Netherlands and Stuttgart said to be pushing.",
      "In addition to furthering the suggestion that the Gunners could move for Osimhen, it has been suggested that the north London side could look to tempt Napoli with some players of their own.

      "Despite an improvement of six places, a mammoth 19 points and seven more top-flight victories from the previous campaign, Pochettino left the Blues by mutual consent after their final day win over Bournemouth.

      "Aaronson, 23, insists he is just thinking of regaining his US spot for the Copa America, which starts on June 20, after he was dropped by coach Gregg Berhalter for the last international break in March. “I’m just kind of focused on the national team and having my full responsibility here,” he said. “I’m not thinking about anything else and that’s where my headspace is.",

      "Sunderland value Jobe at over £20million - and his hand his strengthened by the fact he has four years left on his deal. Birmingham would be due 15 per cent of any fee as he came through their academy.

      "The Red Devils ended the season with a 2-1 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup last weekend which eased the pressure on under-fire boss Erik ten Hag. Reports had suggested that the Dutchman was facing the sack regardless of the result at Wembley, but the victory does seem to have quietened down sack rumours.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Marcel Sabitzer produced an impressive performance for Borussia Dortmund against Real Madrid in the Champions League final - having spent the second half of the 2022/23 campaign on loan at Old Trafford",
      "Manchester United fans have pointed out that the decision not to keep Marcel Sabitzer at Old Trafford was a 'massive mistake' after his performance in the Champions League final.",
      "Sabitzer spent the second half of the 2022/23 season on loan at the Red Devils after signing him from Bayern Munich. During his time at United, Sabitzer won the FA Cup and played an important role in them finishing third, making 18 appearances and directly contributing to four goals.",
      "The Austrian returned to Bayern last summer but made an abrupt exit, securing a move to Borussia Dortmund in July 2023 on a four-year contract. The 30-year-old has impressed since his move to Dortmund, scoring six times and picking up nine assists in 40 appearances.",
      "He also put in a starring display at Wembley on Saturday, even though Dortmund fell short and suffered a 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid. That has since see fans take to social media and say that United should have signed Sabitzer on a permanent deal, while others were sad to see him in tears at full-time.",
      "\"We should have kept Sabitzer,\" one fan said. Someone else added: \"Sending Sancho on loan is not the mistake, it’s not signing Sabitzer [that] is a massive mistake.\"",
      "A third claimed: \"How on earth did United not keep Sabitzer, though?\" Another tweeted: \"For what it's worth, I would've loved it if Sabitzer lifted that trophy.",
      "While a fifth wrote: \"Cheer up, Sabitzer, cheer up… Gotta feel for Dortmund, they will have nightmares for not taking their chances.\" Somebody else posted: \"Happy for Madrid, sad to see Sabitzer sad.\"",
      "A seventh said: \"If ever there was a player United should’ve kept, it was Sabitzer… midfield Swiss knife with [the] end product.\" Another admitted: \"Feel bad for Sabitzer. Would have been nice to see him win the UCL. Was really handy for us last season.\"",
      "Dortmund were impressive for the most part against Real, dominating the first-half in particular and would have been kicking themselves for not getting their noses in front. Carlo Ancelotti's side punished them for missing chance after chance with Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Jr scoring to seal the win.",
      "Despite this, Dortmund boss Edin Terzic cut an upbeat mood. Speaking after the game, Terzić said: \"We lured almost 100,000 people to London with the belief that we would win this game.",
      "\"We also have one wish: even if it gets tough and doesn’t work out right away, that you don’t start to doubt immediately after the first experience that you would have wished differently.",
      "“We need this belief. Only with this belief will success and self-confidence emerge. And that is the clear mission from tomorrow.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho is ready to go back to Manchester United - but only if Erik ten Hag leaves this summer.",
      "‌Sancho has been a huge success during his six-month loan spell back at Borussia Dortmund and the German club would like to sign him on a permanent basis. But Dortmund are faced with two major obstacles in United’s price is almost certain to be too expensive for them to make it happen as it will be in excess of £50million.",
      "And England international Sancho, 24, is reluctant to give up on his United career and still has an ambition to make it work at Old Trafford. But there is also a realisation that Sancho will not have a future under current boss Ten Hag.",
      "‌ Sancho was ostracised under Dutchman Ten Hag for a row over a social media post and then he refused to back down or apologise. Ten Hag has also made his feelings clear recently by claiming publicly that United have been pleased to see the winger do well at Dortmund because that will keep his valuation high.",
      "‌That appeared to be shutting the door on any chance of Sancho going back to Old Trafford while Ten Hag remains in charge. Ten Hag is still waiting on his own future to be resolved with United carrying out an in-depth club review before deciding whether to stick with him or change managers.",
      "Former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, Brentford's Thomas Frank and Mauricio Pochettino are all seen as potential replacements. Sancho still harbours ambitions of playing at the very highest level and his performances in helping Dortmund reach the Champions League final have only served to underline his talent.",
      "That is why Sancho is reluctant to give up on United even though he is wanted at Dortmund and adored by their fans. Sancho joined United from Dortmund for £73m in 2021 but the deal has yet to reap rich rewards and another loan deal could be an option even if the Germans cannot afford to keep him long term.",
      "Your turn! Should Manchester United sell Jadon Sancho? Let us know your stance in the comments section",
      "Dortmund boss Edin Terzic has gone on record as saying they want to keep Sancho. \"I am really happy that he is with us,\" Terzic said before Saturday's crushing 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the final. \"Playing in a final in his hometown, it's a very special moment for him.",
      "\"You can feel the joy he receives and brings in the dressing room. I am very happy to work with Jadon. We don't know yet what the future will bring. But for sure, it's going to bring him another Champions League final.\"",

      "Manchester United could lose the services of Bruno Fernandes this summer with the midfielder's agent reportedly holding talks with Bayern Munich.",
      "Fernandes, 29, has been one of United's most influential players since joining the club in 2020, but that hasn't deterred other clubs from targeting the Portugal international in recent weeks.",
      "It's been widely reported that Bayern Munich hold an interest in the Manchester United captain, who is under contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2026 - and the German giants have now seemingly made their move.",
      "As first revealed by Portuguese outlet O Jogo, Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, has opened talks with Bayern ahead of the upcoming transfer window.",
      "The report also outlines that Barcelona are monitoring the situation and could join Bayern in making an approach for the player, who has scored 79 goals and contributed a further 65 assists in 232 appearances for the Red Devils since joining from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Speculation over Fernandes' future, and the possibility that he could move on from Old Trafford after four-and-a-half years, has ramped up in recent weeks. And while it is anticipated that Manchester United are open to selling players this summer, it remains to be seen if they would entertain offers for such a key figure.",
      "Fernandes himself had been coy over his future in recent weeks, stressing he would not think about such things until after Euro 2024. He did, however, go on record to stress that he wants to stay at Old Trafford before United's victory in the FA Cup final against Manchester City last weekend.",
      "Fernandes conducted an in-depth interview with The Player’s Tribune in the build-up to that match and dropped the clearest hint yet over his future, saying: “I love to step out at Old Trafford more than anything in the world. I don’t want to leave. This has always been my ultimate dream.",

      "The RB Leipzig starlet enjoyed a successful first season at the club where he scored 18 goals across all competitions while picking up his first piece of silverware in Germany in the form of the DFL Supercup thanks to their 3-0 win over Bayern Munich last year.",
      "Despite starting just 17 Bundesliga games, the Slovenia international ended the season in red-hot form, bagging in seven consecutive games as Leipzig secured a fourth-placed finish, ensuring their participation in the Champions League next season.",
      "Sesko - who's been subject to rumours of a move to Arsenal - had established himself as a regular goal-scorer during his time with Red Bull Salzburg and has lived up to expectations thus far in Germany.",
      "His impressive reputation in front of goal almost didn't come to fruition due to his dad's wish for him to become a goalkeeper and follow in his footsteps. The 21-year-old's father, Ales, was a keen shot-stopper in the family’s hometown Radece.",
      "\"He was the same height as me and we played a lot of football together,\" Sesko told The Guardian last year. \"At the start he wanted me to be a keeper too but I said to him: 'Look, it’s really boring, I can’t do it any more!'\"",
      "After a brief moment playing in defence, Sesko's tendency to smash the back of the net nurtured his move up the pitch as he revealed his idolisation of ex- Manchester United striker Ibrahimovic. \"I was playing centre-back and I always took the ball and tried to score goals. It was always goals, goals, goals and that’s why I became a striker,\" he said before admitting: \" Zlatan Ibrahimovic was my idol.",
      "\"I’m not saying I play like him but he was having fun, enjoying himself on the pitch, doing what he wanted to do. It makes me really happy when I see that kind of player. Every single video I could find, I was looking at him.\"",
      "Sesko doesn't ever seem satisfied with himself as he discussed his urge to continue scoring and improving. \"I’m very happy on this stage and want to score more and more, sometimes I have to stop myself and say: 'Look, this can take time and then it’s going to work.' But I’m really, really happy with the start.\""

      "As sweet as winning the FA Cup last week was for Ten Hag, the reality is that the quality of a team is measured over 38 games - and United are getting worse. I remember Ralf Rangnick suggesting that the club needed open-heart surgery when he handed the keys to Old Trafford over to the Dutchman.",
      "The shock Wembley win over Manchester City at Wembley may have got fans’ pulses racing - and rightly so given they prevented their rivals from across town from claiming another piece of history with a second successive Double. But let’s be honest, in the grand scheme of things the win was worth little more than a few local bragging rights.",
      "It has simply papered over cracks that at times appeared to be growing wider than the ones that allow rain water to flood through the leaky roof of United’s stadium.",
      "United played like the underdogs they were. They were full of bite and aggression. And their one flash of creativity produced a wonderful second goal for Kobbie Mainoo that transpired to be the winner.",
      "But they are never going to close the huge gap on City, Arsenal and Liverpool at the summit of English football by playing like that every week. Being rank outsiders suited Ten Hag’s team perfectly.",

And, the truth is, it’s because United have produced so much mundane stuff in the Premier League that Ten Hag still finds his future under threat.",

      "United did to City what other teams spent last season doing to them. But you need much more than that to be Premier League champions. Sir Jim Ratcliffe now has to decide whether to put his faith in those 90 minutes or the last nine months.",

As a result there is talk of a move back on a permanent basis, but Kehl is unsure whether they'll achieve that given his contract with the Red Devils and the lack of terms in his loan agreement.",

      "But before that memorable 1998/99 season, United looked to have a Champions League curse lingering over them. Ferguson was a serial winner, but the big-eared European trophy was always out of the Scotsman's reach.",
      "With the bulk of Ferguson's players hitting their peak in the 1996/97 season, many thought United's best hopes of European success were over when Borussia Dortmund beat them 2-0 on aggregate in the semi-final of the competition. When that campaign came to a close, United captain and star man Eric Cantona left Old Trafford and retired from football.",

Looking back on that decisive campaign, the legendary Dane said he would have left were it not for Ferguson.",
      "“I have to be honest to say, at some point, I was starting to doubt that,” Schmeichel said on Prime Video's ‘99’ documentary when asked if he believed United would win the Champions League at the time. “When you play for Manchester United, we claim to be the biggest club in the world.\"",

That is what we can offer them, the rest we will see.",

      "Darts star Michael Smith picked an unfortunate game to try and see Cristiano Ronaldo with his son, and he's keen on a Saudi Darts Masters so he can make up for it",
      "It seems like only a matter of time before darts heads to Saudi Arabia, and Michael Smith is hoping it happens soon as his son is desperate to watch Cristiano Ronaldo play.",
      "In recent years all major sports have been given Saudi attention, with the nation splashing the cash in order to bring the action over to the Kingdom - add receiving plenty of criticism in the process. LIV Golf has attracting some of the sport's biggest names, top boxing fight night's are now staged in Riyadh, and major European football teams have played over there, with major players such as Ronaldo transferring permanently to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters will also debut later this year, and with Matchroom Sport president Barry Hearn at the centre of negotiations he's also hinted that darts could soon follow. Smith would \"love\" to be part of a Saudi Darts Masters, and would use the opportunity to take his son to see Ronaldo play for current team Al-Nassr.",
      "Smith and his youngest son are both Manchester United fans, and his little boy was crushed when the 2023 World Darts Champion attempted to fulfil his dreams of seeing the five-time Ballon d'Or winner play. Smith took his son to Old Trafford when Ronaldo was playing for United during his second stint at the club, but attended the infamous home game against Tottenham where the Portuguese international refused to come off the bench.",
      "\"I took him once at Old Trafford, and it was the game where he refused to come on and walked down the tunnel in the 87th minute so we never got to see him play, I think it was against Spurs,\" Smith exclusively told Mirror Sport while in New York for the US Darts Masters. \"So I'd love to take him out there (Saudi Arabia) to see him play.",
      "\"Hopefully we can go next year, and can go quickly because my youngest keeps asking to see Ronaldo so I'd love to take him to see Ronaldo play.\" The game in question that saw Smith's son get let down was between United and Spurs, and took place in October 2022, shortly before Ronaldo's controversial interview with Piers Morgan, and was likely a contributing factor to his outburst.",
      "For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to   The Mirror US   .",
      "Ronaldo made a dream return to United in the summer of 2021, but just a year later he was already looking to leave after the club failed to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "After remaining at the club for the start of the 2022/23 season, Ronaldo was already unimpressed, but the breaking point came when he was an unused substitute during a 6-3 defeat to Manchester City. Ronaldo clashed with manager Erik ten Hag and made for a difficult first season at the club, and he was severely tested in the game against Tottenham.",
      "When Ten Hag went to put Ronaldo on with United 2-0 ahead, the star refused to come on and instead walked off down the tunnel. Ronaldo then left the club in January after an agreement with Saudi Arabia was agreed on December 30.",
      "Smith hopes to take his son with him if a Saudi Darts Masters is scheduled in the future, but admits it may be difficult due to the party atmosphere in darts. There is already a Bahrain Darts Masters that has been running since 2023, but playing in Saudi would be a major culture shock.",
      "\"Every other sport is there so why not darts? One of the best sports, the biggest party. That is the problem in Saudi, the party side of it,\" Smith added.",
      "\"It's going to be difficult but if I'm part of it when it's there I'd love to go. I like to go to Dubai, I like to take my wife and kids on holiday. Straight from there we go to Bahrain, the kids love it. So why not in Saudi?\""

      "Man Utd supporters have had their say on who the club should offload in the summer transfer window.",
      "Marcus Rashford's future looks set to be a story that dominates the headlines throughout this summer. Manchester United are set for a huge squad rebuild, and that has led to a number of players being made available for transfer.",
      "Rashford has endured a tough year on the pitch, scoring just eight goals for United in all competitions. Having managed 30 the previous campaign, that represents a major drop-off in form.",
      "The forward has been criticised at times for his perceived level of effort and attitude, by pundits and United matchgoers alike, and has come in for some stinging criticism.",
      "In the penultimate game of the Premier League season, and the last one at Old Trafford, Rashford confronted a United supporter who was giving him grief during the warm-up. It was the latest incident in a series of disappointments for the player after his wonderful 2022/23 campaign.",
      "He was omitted from the England Euro 2024 squad by Gareth Southgate, no surprise given his form but a setback for a player who had lit up the World Cup in a Three Lions shirt.",
      "Rashford's form and the noise surrounding him has led to speculation that United could look to cash in on him this summer. Ineos are conducting a thorough review of the first team squad, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe having appointed a series of power brokers at the club tasked with turning around the football fortunes.",
      "The Manchester Evening News revealed in April that only four players were safe from the axe - Andre Onana, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund - with United willing to accept bids for every other squad member, including Rashford and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "And a larger number of fans would like Rashford to be sold by the club this summer than want to see him stay, with many preferring Amad over the academy graduate.",
      "That's according to a survey by MEN Sport, which had more than 56,000 responses, with fans ultimately torn on Rashford. A small majority of 51% want to see the club offload the forward this summer when asked to either 'keep' or 'sell' every member of United's current squad, with 49% wanting to retain the forward.",
      "United have a dilemma this summer. With FFP rules likely to impact their ability to fully remodel the squad, they need to sell a number of players to finance new signings, and Rashford - as a homegrown player - would represent pure profit for the club, as would the likes of Mason Greenwood and Scott McTominay.",
      "It means an added attraction to the player leaving. Arsenal, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain have all been linked with a move for the 26-year-old recently, though Rashford has no immediate desire to leave Old Trafford. Instead, he has used his X account - before he took a break from social media - to reaffirm his commitment.",
      "\"I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively,\" he said. \"Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.\"",
      "United are looking to strengthen their attack in the summer regardless of who remains, with a forward capable of covering and challenging Hojlund needed, as well as potentially a right winger like Michael Olise. It was noticeable that fans preferred to keep Amad - 88% voting to retain him at the club - more than Rashford, although Antony's time at Old Trafford would be over if it was up to the majority of supporters, with just 17% wanting to keep him.",
      "But the vote does show how fans are split on Rashford. United will have a similar dilemma this summer should a big bid for the player come in.",

      "The narrative around Sancho heading into the Champions League final was fascinating, as there were wide suggestions he'd returned to the best version of himself.",
      "In that game, Sancho became the first player to complete 10+ dribbles in a Champions League semi-final match across the last eight seasons, he had the beating of Nuno Mendes and looked to have developed a yard of pace that was lacking in his displays for Manchester United.",
      "Darren Fletcher - the broadcaster, not the former United midfielder - and Ally McCoist waxed lyrical about Sancho but hardly mentioned him just a few weeks later at Wembley.",
      "Fletcher and McCoist represent a British broadcaster and were naturally drawn to the most recognisable player. Their commentary in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final influenced the perception of Sancho back home but the truth is his loan has been far from anything special.",
      "The talk in the German media shortly after Sancho re-signed on loan in the January transfer window was that he looked like a different player to the youngster who previously excelled for Dortmund between 2017 and 2021 after signing from Manchester City.",
      "That was probably expected given Sancho hadn't played a competitive fixture for months, but he gradually got back up to speed and still didn't pull up any trees.",
      "Sancho's loan with Dortmund has ended and he recorded three goals and three assists in 21 appearances, which is hardly an outstanding return for a forward.",
      "While it's been great to see Sancho play football with a smile on his face and his loan has boosted his profile ahead of the summer transfer window, suggestions he's playing his best football again are premature and look a bit daft after the Champions League final.",
      "Sancho was exceptional in just one game for Dortmund over the last six months and it just so happened that fixture was broadcast to an interested British audience.",
      "The 24-year-old knew that game was an opportunity to make a statement and grabbed it with both hands. It shows Sancho still retains the ability to influence huge matches, but it also poses the question of why he fails to consistently perform like that each week.",
      "There have been mentality concerns with Sancho throughout his career. Pep Guardiola questioned his desire, his timekeeping was an issue during his first stint with Dortmund and that problem persisted when he was on England duty and when he reported to Carrington.",
      "In an interview last year, Nemanja Matic said Sancho was 'always late' to United training and a lack of application has seemed to halt his progress in Manchester.",
      "Sancho might have turned a corner since his fallout with Erik ten Hag, which could be used as motivation, but he's still not the player who had the world at his feet.",

      "After Marcus Rashford established himself as Manchester United's most reliable source of goals in 2022/23, the club's aim for the 2023 summer transfer window was clear: sign a striker.",
      "They did just that, landing Rasmus Hojlund from Italian outfit Atalanta for an initial fee of £64million. The Reds had been unable to rely on a prolific No.9 in Erik ten Hag's first season in charge and they felt Hojlund was the ideal candidate to join forces with Rashford and spearhead the attack.",
      "Despite's Rashford's drop-off, Hojlund ended his debut season at Old Trafford with 16 goals to his name. While it was by no means a blistering return, it was most certainly respectable.",
      "But Rashford's tally of eight goals in all competitions meant there was an increase in pressure on the Dane to deliver the goods. However, arriving in England as a 20-year-old, United had to manage expectations.",
      "Fortunately, United's midfielders stepped up this season, with Bruno Fernandes, Scott McTominay, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Hannibal Mejbri and Casemiro scoring 38 goals between them. Considering Fernandes is the only member of that group who is an out-and-out attacking midfielder, it was an impressive haul from the engine room.",
      "Fernandes and McTominay shared the bulk of the load, scoring 25 goals between them, but Mainoo chipped in with five and Casemiro also got halfway towards reaching double figures. Eriksen, Mount and Hannibal got one apiece.",
      "Scoring goals was not something that came easily to United this season; they netted just 57 in the Premier League, marking the lowest tally of anyone who finished inside the top nine. Across all competitions, they scored 88 times in total.",
      "Taking that tally of 88 into account, United's midfielders contributed 43.2 per cent of their overall output, highlighting their importance. Fernandes ended the season with 15 and McTominay netted 10.",
      "But ahead of this summer's transfer window opening for business, it is no secret that big changes are going to be made to the landscape of United's squad, and their midfield could be one of the most impacted areas. Of United's crop of midfielders, only Mainoo has made their list of untouchables, while there is a strong chance McTominay, Casemiro, Eriksen and Hannibal could all be moved on to raise funds and free up space for new arrivals.",
      "United want to sign a central midfielder this summer with Casemiro a likely candidate to be moved on. The Brazilian has scored 12 goals in his United career, but further reinforcements could be required to improve the midfield department. McTominay is one of the most sellable assets within the squad and all funds raised from a potential sale would count as pure profit because of his status as an academy graduate.",
      "As much as United should strive to do that because of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules [PSR], they are going to have to try and ensure any replacements carry a goal threat. United need to have players all over the pitch who are capable of scoring and can contribute to the team's attacking output, just as Ten Hag demanded in his first season in charge.",
      "\"We have many goalscorers across the offensive department,\" he said, speaking in October 2022. \"But we also need something from midfield and the defensive department.\"",
      "United ended the 2022/23 season with 34 goals from their midfielders, meaning they saw a slight increase in 2023/24. But there could be a higher turnover in personnel this summer than there was last, with only Marcel Sabitzer and Fred departing from that area of the team.",
      "United will hope Mainoo will build on this season's tally of five, while they will also be hoping Mount can overcome this season's injury nightmare to offer more of a goal threat. However, as much as United's midfield landscape needs to change, their outgoings will need to be replaced with players who can contribute inside the final third.",
      "Although there is no denying the midfield department needs a shake-up, United must consider their options. They can ill afford to leave themselves short on goals from the engine room and pile more pressure on the likes of Hojlund and Rashford.",

      "Borussia Dortmund head coach Edin Terzic is confident Manchester United's Jadon Sancho will feature in another Champions League final at some point in his career following Saturday night's 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid at Wembley.",
      "After rekindling his career over the past few months, Sancho dreamt of bringing his Dortmund loan spell to a close by firing them to a first Champions League crown since 1997. Despite producing an eye-catching performance, they were unable to halt Madrid's hopes of winning the trophy for the 15th time.",
      "The Spanish outfit scored twice inside the final 20 minutes, striking through Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Junior. Madrid rode their luck in the first half and were fortunate to head into the break level at 0-0.",
      "Sancho started on Dortmund's right wing and played 87 minutes, being replaced late on by Jamie Bynoe-Gittens. Despite not getting to experience the thrill of being crowned champions of Europe, Dortmund chief Terzic hailed the United loanee in his post-match press conference, insisting he has improved his colleagues during his loan spell.",

      "Ben Foster won the League Cup twice in as many seasons at Man United - but those successes masked what was a difficult time for the former goalkeeper.",
      "It was on April 10, 2005, that Sir Alex Ferguson's son, Darren, etched his name into the Wrexham history books.",
      "After Spanish forward Juan Ugarte had fired the Welsh outfit into a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute of extra-time of the 2005 EFL Trophy Final at the Millennium Stadium, Ferguson Jr added a second with two minutes left on the clock. It clinched Wrexham their first and only EFL Trophy crown to date.",
      "Celebrating with his teammates as father Sir Alex watched from the stands, little did one of Ferguson Jr's colleagues know the legendary Scot had been impressed by his performance. The man in question was former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster.",
      "Foster was on loan at Wrexham from Stoke City, having joined on an initial month's loan in January that year. The deal was eventually extended until the end of the season.",
      "No doubt to Foster's disbelief, he returned to Stoke after the conclusion of his loan spell at the Racecourse Ground and was sold to United in July, signing for a reported fee of £1million. Ferguson was impressed by what he had seen from the shot-stopper when watching him play alongside his son.",
      "Foster, who was 22 at the time, made the switch to Old Trafford without having made a single first-team appearance during his four-year spell at Stoke, which featured a catalogue of loan moves. The goalkeeper soon added another loan spell to his collection, being shipped out to Championship side Watford for the 2005/06 season, making 48 appearances as they clinched promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Watford borrowed him again the following season, giving him a full season's worth of Premier League football that featured him infamously being beaten by Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson from a free-kick around 75 yards from goal. Despite being powerless to stop Watford from suffering an immediate return to the second tier, 29 Premier League appearances served him well.",
      "Back at United, the 2007/08 campaign was nothing more than a write-off for the goalkeeper, with a serious injury restricting him to just one appearance. That one outing, however, saw him mark his United debut with a clean sheet in a 1-0 away win at Derby County. United won the Premier League title that season, but in making just one appearance, he did not qualify for a medal.",
      "The following season, Foster did experience the buzz of having a winner's medal draped around his neck while donning United colours. He won the Man of the Match award as the Reds beat Tottenham Hotspur on penalties in the 2009 League Cup final at Wembley.",
      "After a goalless 120 minutes, United prevailed on spot kicks, winning 4-1. Foster saved one penalty, thwarting Jamie O'Hara with what was Spurs' first penalty of the shootout.",
      "United and Foster were back at Wembley again for the 2010 League Cup final 12 months later. On that occasion, however, Foster watched from the bench as Tomasz Kuszczak started between the sticks, helping United come from behind to beat Aston Villa 2-1.",
      "Foster had played once on the road to Wembley, keeping a clean sheet in a 2-0 away win at Barnsley in the fourth round, meaning he secured a second League Cup winner's medal. He featured more prominently for United that season, earning 13 appearances.",
      "Despite helping United win two League Cup crowns in as many seasons, Foster never felt comfortable at Old Trafford, so much so that he admitted earlier this year he \"hated every second\" of his time at the club.",
      "\"It was at a time in my life, mid-20s, 24, 25, I look back at that person who played for United then, and it's not me,\" he revealed, speaking to talkSPORT. \"I was so wet behind the ears, I didn't understand how anything worked in life.",
      "\"But I did [suffer from impostor syndrome]. I hated every second of it. I didn't enjoy it. I was nervous, I was petrified of making a mistake, petrified of what the outside world would say about it.",
      "\"That's a bad way to go about it. When you go into games thinking the worst, or fearing the worst, you're off to a bad start straight away. I'd look around at some of these big names behind me and think, 'how have I got here?'.\"",
      "After clasping his hands on the League Cup for a second time, Foster, who made 23 appearances for United in total, departed Old Trafford on a permanent basis in May 2010, joining Birmingham City. It was an opportunity for him to earn regular football.",
      "Spending just one season at St Andrew's, Foster helped Birmingham beat Arsenal 2-1 in the 2011 League Cup final, with Obafemi Martins famously scoring a last-gasp winner. It marked Foster's third League Cup triumph.",
      "Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League a few months later, meaning Foster moved on and joined West Bromwich Albion, initially on a season-long loan deal. He ended up spending seven years at The Hawthorns, making more than 200 appearances.",
      "A four-year return to Watford followed, ahead of Foster deciding to hang up his boots in September 2022. However, he was tempted out of retirement by Wrexham in March 2023, helping them end their 15-year absence from the Football League by saving a penalty in stoppage time to secure a 3–2 win over Notts County, which helped them move three points clear at the top in the race for promotion.",
      "Having played non-league football at the beginning of his career, it was somewhat fitting that his last career highlight was a historic penalty save that helped Wrexham escape the clutches of non-league football.",
      "Despite what Foster made of his time at United, nobody can ever take those League Cup winner's medals away from him, nor that penalty save at Wembley to deny O'Hara.",

      "“Now he’s gone away to Dortmund to rebuild himself, as a footballer, as a human being, and he has come out the other side. What he’s achieved in this short little period of time has to be looked at and you go, ‘You know what? This kid’s got character’.",

      "\"And that attraction of a balloon coming towards you while the game's going on, I just picked it up and popped it and never thought anything of it. But I started laughing because I thought it was funny. But when I look back after, you can see the bench and manager watching the game, the intensity of the game, and I was just chilled out.",
      "\"I blew this balloon up, and he went ballistic. I thought that was the end of my job, to be fair. He had the fright of his life. But he saw the funny side the next day because I think his grandchildren had mentioned it to him, so I think they had taken the Micky out of him a bit.\"",
      "Ferguson let rip at his deputy and can be seen mouthing \"f*** off\" as he scolded Phelan, whose response was simply to laugh it off. The United icon may now have been laughing at the time, though even he could see the funny side in time.",
      "It also won't have helped Ferguson's mood that the Red Devils failed to secure all three points that day in west London. Park Ji-Sung put United ahead with an early breakthrough, only for Salomon Kalou to rescue a 1-1 draw with his 80th-minute equaliser.",
      "What United would give to have Ferguson back in their dugout today after going more than four years without a win at Stamford Bridge. However, fewer jump scares has to be one happy upside of the club legend's retirement.",

      "Latest Man United transfer news and gossip with updates on Chelsea defender Trevoh Chalobah and AS Monaco star Youssouf Fofana",
      "Chelsea centre-back Trevoh Chalobah has reportedly emerged as a target for Manchester United to replace Raphael Varane.",
      "The 24-year-old could be heading towards the exit door at Chelsea following the news that a deal has been agreed for Tosin Adarabioyo to join on a free transfer. Adarabioyo, who spent four seasons at Fulham, opted against renewing his contract at Craven Cottage.",
      "United, meanwhile, had also been linked with a move for Adarabioyo as a replacement for Varane - who will leave this summer when his contract expires. After missing out, The Guardian claims United's focus has turned to Chalobah.",
      "It is reported that he is now a target and could be available for a £25million fee. Chalobah, who came through Chelsea's ranks, became a regular at the end of the season but after Benoit Badiashile and Axel Disasi were signed last summer, his minutes have been limited.",
      "Elsewhere, Youssouf Fofana has suggested there is an agreement between himself and Monaco, should any club approach the Ligue 1 side over a transfer. The links to the 25-year-old initially emerged last year prior to the January window.",
      "However, a move didn't materialise and now clubs, including Arsenal, are circling as he is approaching the final year of his contract this summer. It is believed Fofana has been identified as a potential replacement for Casemiro who had an underwhelming campaign at Old Trafford.",
      "The Brazilian's future is uncertain beyond the summer as he continues to be strongly linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Monaco director Thiago Scuro has said that the club would be open to selling Fofana and revealed that £26m (€30m) could get a deal over the line. \"He is probably one of the players that we are open to selling this summer,\" Scuro said. \"We will see the opportunities that he has.\"",
      "Now the player himself, has suggested that Monaco may even go as far as to facilitate his departure. During a press-conference ahead of the Euro 2024, he said: \"My future? I have spoken about it with the hierarchy, it isn’t a secret. We had exchanges and they agreed to accompany me in this new stage.",
      "\"If it (a move) doesn’t happen, I still have a year left and I will be happy to stay. We were in agreement that we would accompany each other in this process in which everyone should be a winner, be it me or the club. We were in agreement that we would accompany each other in this process in which everyone should be a winner, be it me or the club.\"",

      "The bookmakers priced United up at 8/1 to win against Manchester City, who most expected to lift the trophy after winning the Premier League but the game didn't go to script.",
      "United look transformed and were excellent from the first whistle. The tactical shape was different, there was less space to exploit and the pressing was executed intelligently.",
      "The Reds were value for the victory and deservedly lifted the trophy at Wembley. It was a special day in the capital and there were some brilliant, uplifting scenes during the celebrations, which was a welcome tonic at the end of a season that was otherwise incredibly disappointing.",
      "Nobody needs to be reminded that United finished eighth in the Premier League, recorded their most defeats in a top-flight campaign and suffered some awful results along the way.",
      "United were out of the Carabao Cup and Europe before Christmas and there is a bank of evidence available that suggests Ten Hag would be lucky to keep his job at Old Trafford.",
      "Some fans have created positive and negative columns to weigh up whether to keep Ten Hag and emotions have influenced thinking since the FA Cup final victory.",
      "When the MEN asked its readership for their thoughts on Ten Hag after the 4-0 Crystal Palace hammering, just 39 per cent wanted the Dutchman to stay. However, when that survey was published again after the FA Cup final, that number doubled to 79 per cent in favour of keeping him.",
      "There were 19 days between those games and although fans must have their opinions heard on key issues, that shows why they aren't in charge of running the football club. The decision on Ten Hag's future cannot be influenced by emotion. It must be an objective decision, based on the season's evidence and calculated by the United board.",
      "The build-up to the FA Cup final felt reminiscent of 2016 when Louis van Gaal was sacked after the game, but a week has passed and the decision hasn't been communicated. On Tuesday, sources indicated a decision on Ten Hag wasn't imminent and the week has unexpectedly been quiet when it felt inevitable a decision would be announced.",
      "Ten Hag deserves respect and it was correct not to sack him immediately after the FA Cup final, but it's bizarre a decision on his future is now taken so long to be revealed. What are Ineos waiting for? Have emotions crept into their thought process? Are they keeping Ten Hag? Or is it just that they wanted to handle it properly and with respect? Those are just three possible reasons that could explain the delay.",
      "It was announced on Christmas Eve that Ratcliffe had agreed a deal to acquire a minority stake and his investment was officially signed off in February. There has been plenty of time for INEOS to get their ducks in a row and it was within everyone's interest to announce a decision this week.",
      "New evidence from the season isn't going to come to light - it has been there for months - and the prolonged uncertainty is delaying plans for the summer transfer window.",
      "United might be searching for a new manager at this time next week.",

      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "Man Utd need to make at least a couple of key signings during the summer transfer window but getting away from the 'United tax' is never easy.",
      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present.

      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",

      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",

However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "United sources say Brailsford has been attending meetings this month to gauge the performance challenge at United, whose title drought is certain to tick past 12 years.",
      "Although Ineos plan to hire a sporting director and potentially a head of recruitment, the incumbent football director John Murtough wants to remain at the club.",

      "However, Murtough feels his involvement in picking players has been limited and six of Ten Hag's permanent additions played in the Eredivisie.",
      "Brailsford and Jean Claude Blanc, the Ineos chief executive for sport, are due to join the United football board. A new chief executive could report into Blanc but it is unlikely Patrick Stewart, the interim chief executive, will stay in the role permanently.",

      "Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher have appeared in the FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League for Man United already this season and are only still 16.",
      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Man United are set to be active in this summer's transfer window, with several positions in need of addressing",
      "With less than two weeks to go until their opening game of the European Championship, England supporters are anxiously waiting to find out if Luke Shaw will be fit.",
      "The Manchester United defender has been a staple for the Three Lions at each of the last two major tournaments, cementing himself as Gareth Southgate's first-choice left-back. Despite his injury struggles this season, he has still made Southgate's provisional 33-man squad.",
      "However, he will play no part in tonight's friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina after missing training on Sunday. He has not played since February 18 after sustaining a muscle injury that forced him off in United's 2-1 win at Luton Town.",
      "Southgate, when naming his provisional squad almost a fortnight ago, said the defender was \"up against it\" ahead of the tournament. As a result, it could be touch and go for him to make the final 26-man squad that must be named by 11pm this Friday.",
      "Coupled with Tyrell Malacia's season on the sidelines, Shaw's struggles this term meant United faced their fair share of challenges at left-back. Shaw made just 15 appearances in all competitions, meaning Diogo Dalot or Aaron Wan-Bissaka regularly deputised on the left of the back four.",
      "Ahead of next season, United are planning for plenty of transfer activity, with Ineos determined to make much-needed alterations. It is understood United plan to sign a centre-back, a central midfielder and a striker as leading priorities.",
      "However, this season's injury troubles in the left-back department mean United may be forced into strengthening that area of the team as a priority as well. Malacia has not played in 12 months, meaning he is going to require a lot of time to get back to his best, and Shaw's unreliability has to be called into question.",
      "What's most frustrating and potentially troublesome for United is the fact Shaw, when fit, is one of the best left-backs in the world. He was instrumental during the 2022/23 season, producing an excellent partnership down United's left-hand side with Marcus Rashford. He also linked up nicely with Lisandro Martinez on the left of the defence.",
      "Amid the fact Shaw has played north of 30 matches in just one of the last three seasons, it does create a question about his reliability to remain United's first-choice left-back. Qualification for the Europa League after their FA Cup success means United could play up to 67 matches - the maximum they could have played without European football would have been 51, not far off the highest number of appearances Shaw has made for United in a single season.",
      "Erik ten Hag recently declared that Shaw, as a result of a serious injury he suffered earlier in his career, is incapable of playing 60 games in a season. The highest tally of appearances he has managed for United in a single season is 47, achieving that in 2020/21 and 2022/23 respectively.",
      "Ten Hag said: \"Shaw is the best left-back in the world, he is so good. But he had a very serious injury at the beginning of his career. As a result, he will never be able to play 60 games in a year.\"",
      "In 10 seasons at Old Trafford, Shaw has only played more than 30 games in a single campaign four times. It is a hugely frustrating reality for the left-back.",
      "That reality, however, means United may not have a choice but to invest in a starting left-back ahead of next season, as difficult a decision as that may be. Shaw is one of the very best in the business and it is almost impossible to overlook him when he is available for selection.",
      "But the prospect of United playing almost 70 matches in 2024/25 means they need to head into the new campaign with sufficient quality and depth available to them. They cannot afford a repeat of this season's struggles in the left-back department.",
      "United, of course, have already trimmed their left-back department this summer, offloading Alvaro Fernandez on a permanent basis. However, Harry Amass will be looking to force his way into the first-team environment on a permanent basis after making the bench on seven occasions this term.",
      "But considering he only turned 17 in March, he would almost certainly be happy with making the odd appearance here and there. Instead, United may have to go looking for a ready-made starter to leapfrog Shaw, or at least provide sufficient competition.",
      "Any decision that potentially sees Shaw axed from the top of the pecking order is likely to be an emotional one, such is his undisputed level of quality when fit. However, United have to think about the collective and their aspirations of making progress.",

His £1.25billion deal was formalised on Christmas Eve and subsequently ratified by the Premier League in February.",
      "Since then, United have started to shake things up behind the scenes. Omar Berrada has swapped blue for red and the former Manchester City chief will officially arrive as CEO on July 13.",

      "The Manchester Evening News understands - as reported in February - that INEOS want Ashworth to head up their footballing department and report to Berrada with a team to be assembled around their sporting director.",
      "Berrada was appointed to replace Richard Arnold as CEO after he stood down when INEOS Group finalised their investment. The new co-owners wanted someone well-versed in football as a business and that plan led them to Berrada, who spent eight years at Barcelona prior to his time at City.",
      "Negotiations between United and Newcastle continue over Ashworth and he wants to join the club. Compensation for his services is the primary stumbling block with Ratcliffe branding Newcastle \"silly\", \"stupid\" and \"absurd\" for reportedly demanding as much as £20million for Ashworth. United sources previously declared they would not pay £10million to recruit Ashworth.",
      "The club are prepared to play the waiting game for Ashworth but are also ready to start work on assembling the team that would work around him.",
      "In effect, there would be a straight line running between Berrada, Ashworth and Wilcox in the top positions, with Ashworth heading up the footballing department and Wilcox fulfilling a role beneath him.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson always tried to protect Manchester United's secrets from inside the dressing room, but one player often enjoyed giving fans a peak behind the curtain",
      "Manchester United icon Brian McClair admitted he risked the sack at Old Trafford with his magazine column he'd write while playing at the club.",
      "The Scot had a little side project which saw him write a column that went into the club's monthly 'Inside United' magazine. Seemingly given free rein to write what he liked, he would craftily get funny stories published and share club secrets to give United fans a peak behind the curtain.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson also contributed a column, albeit with much more caution regarding the content shared. Now 60, McClair admitted, on reflection, that he regularly risked the wrath of Ferguson with his column.",
      "Speaking on his podcast 'Life With Brian', when questioned about whether he ever worried about losing his job over the stories he shared, McClair said: \"I still don't know how I managed it.",
      "\"Even if there was some favouritism going on, I still don't know how, to this day, I managed to get away with some of the things I got away with. I still cast my mind back to some of the things that I did that were possibly sackable.\"",
      "McClair added his cheeky column in the United magazine became a hit among players and staff, with some even feeding him insider stories for publication. \"It's not that I didn't care, but I had nobody to be beholden to,\" McClair said, via the Mirror.",
      "Sign up to our United newsletter so you never miss an update from Old Trafford this season.",
      "\"What was always in the back of your head, particularly with Ferguson, was that it could be your last interview. I used to do a little diary in the United magazine which became quite popular which was mischievous.",
      "\"Some of it was factual, because people always wanted to know what was happening inside the dressing room and the training pitch and some of it was fiction.",
      "\"When I wrote it, there would be a four-week lag before the magazine came out, so by the time the magazine came out, people had forgotten what I had written. Once or twice, I got hauled into the manager's office, more when I was coaching than when I was playing.",
      "\"It was to give me a row about some little, piece of thing, that I had written. The players couldn't wait to tell you something they thought was funny that had happened in the dressing room, or the training pitch or whatever.\"",
      "Ferguson, renowned for his tight ship at Old Trafford, was vigilant against leaks and protective of his team's privacy, especially from the media. However, it seemed that the former Motherwell and Celtic forward's performances ensured he always remained in Ferguson's good books.",
      "McClair scored 118 goals and provided 16 assists in 450 appearances for United between 1987 and 1998. His most notable season was his first, where he netted 28 goals in 46 appearances for the Red Devils during the 1987/88 campaign.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand tried diving into the world of becoming a professional boxer between 2017 and 2018, experiencing sharing the ring with a heavyweight and suffering big blows",
      "Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand has opened up about his impressive journey of trying to become a professional boxer – a dream that was eventually crushed by the British Boxing Board of Control.",
      "At the age of 45 now, had fate steered in another direction, Ferdinand could have been deep into a six-year boxing career by this point. He might have even featured on the undercard for Tyson Fury's undisputed heavyweight championship face-off against Oleksandr Usyk last month.",
      "After hanging up his football boots in 2015, Ferdinand went on to discover a newfound passion for boxing when he was invited to appear on a documentary 'Defender to Contender'. The documentary sought to chart his path to turning pro within a period of 18 months under the stern guidance of boxing coach and ex-pugilist Richie Woodhall.",
      "The former defender managed to sculpt himself into an impressive fight-ready physique. And he even had a taste of the boxing life, sparring with leading figures in the heavyweight category such as Frazer Clarke. However, his dreams were cut short when the BBBofC denied his application for a boxing license.",
      "Nevertheless, there is no bitterness towards the boxing authorities from Ferdinand's side. Although the opportunity to pursue a career in the ring was denied, he garnered a unique perspective on what it entails to enter the rough-and-tumble world of boxing.",
      "While promoting his team 'FIVE FC', Ferdinand told the Mirror: \"It was a weird time in my life. I needed something to stimulate me and to keep my mind focused for personal reasons.",
      "\"Then an offer just came out of the blue. I said they must have seen me when I was vulnerable, a moment to get me. I didn't actually even think about or consider the problems or what could happen and the risk, someone offered me the opportunity.",
      "\"[They said] 'Do you want to go from being a professional footballer to being a professional boxer?' I loved the idea and to see if I could do it, so I threw myself into it.",
      "\"I did it for about five or six months, training, like, 5-to-6 times a week – really, really intense. Unfortunately, at the end of the year, the authorities declined my bid to get a professional contract in this country.",
      "\"A few things that happened, obviously behind the scenes with people's health and that. I've got to say, they probably made the right decision, in terms of protecting me for my own health.\"",
      "Towards the final part of his rigorous training, Ferdinand posted a snap of himself showcasing a rippling physique akin to Usyk and Anthony Joshua's. \"Yeah, I was ridiculous,\" he replied when questioned on how well he had conditioned himself.",
      "\"I lost about nine or 10 kilograms. I looked really ripped. I look back to when I was playing, [I had] probably a bit more muscle on. I definitely looked better than I've ever looked.\"",
      "Initially, Woodhall focused on converting Ferdinand's fitness regime from the one of a top-tier Premier League footballer to that of a boxer, which was a lengthy and challenging process. Ferdinand spoke of how he didn't spar with a partner for almost three months.",
      "He shared: \"I trained for probably two-and-a-half months before I even sparred anybody. I hadn't even taken one punch. I was always saying to Richie Woodall like, 'Come on, man, get me in with someone, I want to spar'.\"",
      "Eventually, his requests were met with action. A young Frazer Clarke – an Olympic bronze medalist who boasts eight victories, six of them knockouts, and recently engaged in a fierce Fight-of-the-Year contender bout with rival Fabio Wardley – became his sparring companion.",
      "Recalling his experience, Ferdinand said: \"I got in with Frazer and he hit me a few times.\" He added: \"People who don't box just think 'Oh, it's really painful, I'm going to stop'. But my adrenaline kicks in and it kind of takes over everything.\"",
      "Reflecting on the aftermath, he remarked: \"It was good, cut lips and stuff like that. That was a mad thing. You go home in the car and the inside of your mouth was all cut, but you were buzzing. It was ridiculous – a funny, funny feeling.\"",
      "While Rio Ferdinand humorously claimed he could have challenged Usyk and Fury in the ring, he openly acknowledges that he was a novice in the demanding world of boxing. The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) informed him in 2018 that they would not be proceeding with his application for a boxing licence, effectively ending his pugilistic aspirations.",
      "Ferdinand took the news without bitterness or resentment. Following the announcement to his followers about the termination of his boxing journey, BBBofC General Secretary Robert Smith defended their stance, stating: \"It was not sensible for him or for the sport\".",
      "Richie Woodhall believed Ferdinand had the potential to work his way up to professional competition, even though he started boxing at the age of 38. Ferdinand himself concedes that he was merely a beginner in boxing.",
      "Despite his high-level football career with both club and country, Ferdinand disclosed that the daily grind of boxing training was tougher than football. \"It's hard, harder than football,\" he admitted.",
      "\"You're in the red zone. In football, it's not often you get in the red zone. But in boxing, every training session, you get that [feeling of] 'Can you stay with this?' It's hard man. Really hard. I respect boxers massively.\"",

      "Rooney said he was '100 per cent' convinced that some of United's injured players were fit enough to play and Erik ten Hag responded by stating his squad are fully committed.",
      "\"You have to see here in Carrington, the players are desperate to play,\" said Ten Hag. \"Bruno [Fernandes] did a fitness test on Sunday to play and [Marcus] Rashford did everything he could do.\"",
      "Which players Rooney was referencing was open to interpretation, but Luke Shaw's lengthy post on social media a few weeks later suggested he believed he was implicated.",
      "After the FA Cup victory against Manchester City, Shaw wrote: \"Happy for the boys to lift the trophy at the weekend and finish this season on a positive. As much as it was the result I wanted it was hard to watch from the stands. This has definitely been the most frustrating season for me.",
      "\"I have had setback after setback and have worked so hard to get back to fitness but things just haven’t gone my way. I pushed so hard to get back before the end of the season.",
      "\"But some things just aren’t meant to be. There’s nothing I want to do more than play and win with United. I don’t normally react to things I see on social media but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United.",
      "\"The reality is I am not 100% fit for either right now but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating.",
      "\"I appreciate I haven’t updated you all with my injuries and where I’m at with my recovery but equally the most important thing to me is that we’re supporting the team playing. My biggest focus right now is being fit and then whatever happens this summer I will be ready. Thank you for your patience.\"",
      "Shaw exchanged a warm embrace with Ten Hag during the celebrations after the FA Cup victory and his prolonged absence this season has been a huge blow for United.",
      "The left-back ended the campaign having made just 15 starts in all competitions and his last appearance came against Luton Town in February when he sustained a muscle injury.",
      "Many fans rolled their eyes when Shaw's fresh issue was confirmed and it was announced he could miss the remainder of the season. Injury concerns have plagued the defender's 10 years spent at the club but there's an argument that he's been mishandled this season.",
      "A week before Shaw sustained his season-ending injury against Luton, he was substituted at half-time against Aston Villa as a 'precaution'.",
      "He was deemed fit enough to play at Kenilworth Road after overcoming a late fitness test but, with the benefit of hindsight, he should have been given more time to recover.",
      "Ten Hag and his medical staff must take responsibility for giving Shaw the green light to face Luton and the handling of him throughout the season has been questionable.",
      "After picking up an injury at the London Stadium before Christmas, Shaw was absent for more than a month. Then he started against Newport County, Wolves, West Ham, Aston Villa (when he picked up a knock and was substituted at half-time) and Luton in the space of 19 days.",
      "A load of starting a game every 3.8 days immediately after returning from injury is not advisable and he was also poorly handled when he returned from his original muscle injury.",
      "Shaw didn't play any football between August 19 and November 26 but instead of being eased back into action, he was asked to start every game until he couldn't again.",
      "The defender made his return in the 3-0 win against Everton at Goodison Park and then started games against Galatasaray, Newcastle, Chelsea, Bournemouth and Bayern Munich (when he picked up a knock and was substituted at half-time) in the space of 17 days.",
      "That represented a load of a game every 2.8 days, which is absurd after returning from a long-term issue. Shaw was cleared to play after picking up that knock against Bayern, he started against Liverpool and was sidelined for a month in the next game against West Ham.",
      "Shaw's injury record is awful but his situation this season must be empathised with because the demands placed on his body straight after his comebacks have not been fair.",
      "You don't need to be a medical expert to conclude United might have been asking for trouble by starting Shaw in successive games over a short period after sustaining muscle injuries.",
      "There was a clear pattern with Shaw's injuries throughout the season, but he could still be demoted this summer if United sign a left-back who can maintain a clean bill of health.",
      "Shaw signed for United from Southampton in 2014 and he's suffered various muscle, hamstring, ankle, groin, foot and head injuries in his decade spent in Manchester.",
      "He's only been available for 70 per cent of games in a season twice since his arrival, which explains why many believe it's time to sign a replacement for the 28-year-old.",
      "Although Shaw is United's longest-serving player and can be outstanding when available, his injury record is not good enough and it might cost him his starting place.",
      "He was exceptional in the 2022/23 season and was a revelation when starting in central defence, but availability is the best ability to have and he keeps falling short in that area.",
      "In some ways, it's a remarkable achievement Shaw even returned to football after his double leg break in 2015. He is quietly a leader in the dressing room and does charitable work the public isn't aware of, but the bottom line is United need a left-back who can play 60 games per season.",
      "Shaw has joined up with England's training camp ahead of Euro 2024 and Gareth Southgate will give him every chance to make the final squad for the tournament in Germany.",
      "\"I have to say he's up against it - he's missed a lot of football,\" Southgate said on Shaw. \"The fact he's been first choice in that position, we're probably giving him longer than we might have done.",
      "\"I'm not sure what is realistic at this moment in time. I've talked with him, the medical team are liaising with Man United closely. But I would have to say he is a long shot.\"",
      "England will play friendlies next week. Their Euro 2024 campaign will begin on June 16 and United will be selfishly hoping Shaw is omitted from the final squad announcement.",
      "After an injury-hit season, United would reap the rewards of Shaw not playing for England, which would give him a free summer to prepare for the new campaign.",
      "Shaw wants to play for his country if his body allows and that's understandable.",

      "Jadon Sancho faces an increasingly uncertain future at Manchester United despite his impressive performances while on loan at Borussia Dortmund",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe must soon decide whether or not Jadon Sancho still has a future at Manchester United. The 24-year-old, who's enjoyed an excellent vein of form since joining Borussia Dortmund on loan in January, has been heavily linked with an exit.",
      "Sancho, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2026, featured 14 times in the Bundesliga this season, scoring two goals and providing three assists. He quickly cemented himself in Edin Terzic's starting lineup, helping the German giants climb into fifth place.",
      "The England international has been just as impressive on the European stage too, starting each of Borussia Dortmund's knockout ties. Before Sancho returns to Carrington later this summer, he must lock horns with Real Madrid in the Champions League final.",
      "The former Manchester City prospect will be hoping to leave his mark at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night – perhaps an audition for potential suitors or a chance to finally win over Erik ten Hag. Nevertheless, for now, it remains unclear what the future holds for Sancho.",
      "So, with that being said, writers at the Manchester Evening News have stuck their necks out to predict where the showman will be playing his football next season.",
      "In an ideal world, United and Sancho would part ways with a curt handshake; United pocketing a big transfer fee, and Sancho getting his dream move back Dortmund. Unfortunately for both club and player, a permanent exit still looks a tough sell despite his BVB renaissance.",
      "Sancho's monster wages (around £300,000 per week) plus United's desire to recoup as much of the initial £73million transfer fee they paid Dortmund means few teams have the financial muscle to take a gamble on the winger - and make no mistake, Sancho is a gamble given his spectacular fall from grace at Old Trafford.",
      "United are keen to sell given their FFP concerns, but Sancho's remaining book value (£29.2m, according to Reach's chief business of football writer Dave Powell) means they need a substantial sale to profit. Another key factor is Erik ten Hag's fate: the Dutchman exiled Sancho following a public fallout while an apology from the player seems remote at this point, so a fresh start at United is unlikely unless a new head coach is in charge.",
      "Sancho will need to decide what he really wants. The reality is that if he wants to stay at Dortmund, he will have to take a huge pay cut. If not, he'll either be sold to the highest bidder, stuck in loan purgatory elsewhere, or will have to swallow an uneasy truce with United.",
      "For the latter, Sancho would have to apologise to Ten Hag and win over the United fanbase again, but the club can't be too picky at the moment: United are light in both attackers and transfer funds, so Sancho is prime ‘like a new signing' fodder. Ten Hag's recent switch to a tighter formation with a false nine role could also benefit Sancho.",
      "He was signed as a winger, but his key qualities for United have been his technique and passing in tight, central areas along with an ability to find space around the penalty box. I think United should sell, but if they can’t get a respectable deal then I still see a version of the club’s future with Sancho in it.",
      "The first thing to say is that if Erik ten Hag stays as United boss, Sancho will not return to Old Trafford. Outgoing coach Benni McCarthy revealed that the winger refused to apologise to his manager given it would mean he accepted Ten Hag’s claim that his training levels were not up to scratch.",
      "And so, the feud continues. Anyway, the most sensible move for Sancho would be to stay at Borussia Dortmund. In many ways, there is no better time to be at the club.",
      "A Champions League final will no doubt attract more talents over the summer window ahead of a Bundesliga season that will contain a relegated Burnley manager as Bayern Munich’s head coach and a potentially weakened Bayer Leverkusen side that has just played a 53-match campaign.",
      "Two and a half years at United have not bore the kind of fruit Sancho had been hoping for. At times in a career you must either take a gamble or cut your losses. It seems sensible for Sancho to do the latter right now, still aged only 24 with bags of time on his side.",
      "His parting gift will be to help United in their battle against Premier League spending limits. United will not get the £73m they paid for him in 2021, but they too must be wise and cut their own losses.",
      "Jadon Sancho and Manchester United should just part ways this summer. The winger has more than proven himself as a top player since swapping Old Trafford for the Signal Iduna Park in January, and he doesn't need to pull on the Red Devils shirt again to determine otherwise.",
      "Whether he stays at Borussia Dortmund or not, Sancho just needs to find a manager that will fuel his confidence and a team that suits his style of play. Unfortunately, Erik ten Hag and Manchester United provide neither at the moment.",
      "Even if the Dutchman were to be sacked, all parties just need to move on. Fortunately for Ratcliffe, Sancho remains a lucrative asset on the transfer market meaning the Red Devils can cash in and fund a spending spree.",
      "With the windfall secured from his sale, Manchester United could put money towards signing Michael Olise and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, the duo will cost far more than the sum they'll receive for Sancho but it'd certainly be a nice boost.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s future at Manchester United could have a lot to do with if Erik ten Hag is the manager or not going into next season. A public fall-out with the boss means that there seems to be no way back for Sancho if the Dutchman remains in charge.",
      "But if the decision to make a managerial change is made, then it could also change Sancho’s fortunes. Working with a new manager at the helm could potentially revive Sancho’s career at the club.",
      "Having said that, for United the most realistic option is probably to cash in this summer, especially given eyes being on the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability rules (PSR). While they will not get what they paid for him, the money made could be spent on strengthening the squad in the summer window, whether that's with or without Ten Hag.",

Sancho joined the Bundesliga side on loan until the end of the season in January after falling out of favour under Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.",

      "Jude Bellingham will be looking to round off a season to remember when representing Real Madrid in the Champions League final",
      "Jude Bellingham will be the star of the show during Saturday's Champions League final between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "The English midfielder has enjoyed a remarkable debut campaign with Los Blancos, scoring 23 goals and providing 12 assists for team-mates on course to securing a La Liga title and Spanish Super Cup. Now on the verge of conquering Europe, he will be the favourite to claim the Ballon d'Or if this dream comes true.",
      "He will of course be coming head-to-head against the side that kick-started his rapid progression in the game, Dortmund, providing an added edge to Saturday's fixture. The German side were the club to complete a deal for the 20-year-old four years ago, beating Manchester United to the transfer so many wanted to get over the line.",
      "It was not for a lack of trying the Red Devils failed to recruit the Birmingham City academy graduate, having rolled out the red carpet to convince Bellingham to join during a visit he paid to Carrington in 2020.",
      "Bryan Robson, Erica Cantona and Sir Alex Ferguson were both part of the plan to sell the dream of stepping out at Old Trafford to the youngster, though",
      "Of the view United had done enough to wrap up a deal, Robson later reflected: \"It was really disappointing. We were at Carrington and Sir Alex Ferguson was there a little earlier than I was, but Eric and I met him, and his mum and dad, and we were chatting away. “It was really looking promising that he was going to be signing for Manchester United... me and Eric did a rubbish job as he signed for Borussia! We thought we had him in the bag!\"",
      "Also present was then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who revealed on Stick to Football how it was clear Bellingham had a clear vision of what he expected from his next club. \"Jude, he was in the building. I was there, Sir Alex Ferguson was there, Bryan Robson and Eric Cantona were all there that day when he came to the club,\" said the Norwegian.",
      "\"We all spoke to him and sold it as well as we could. He knew what he wanted, a certain amount of minutes in the first team. He was 17 at the time, and he was the most mature 17-year-old I’ve ever met – he had it all planned out.\"",
      "Many theories have emerged as to why Bellingham snubbed United in favor of a move to Germany, with the most prominent relating to assurances over gametime. Supporting this suggestion, former Birmingham City CEO Dong Ren made clear finances were not at all related to the player's Dortmund decision.",
      "\"United made the biggest offer we received compared to Bayern, Dortmund, Leicester or other clubs like Wolves,\" Ren told Mundo Deportivo. \"Ed Woodward [then United CEO] was the most insistent. We sat down and talked about how we could convince Bellingham. But Jude didn't make any decisions based on money. “They offered much more salary compared to the rest. Maybe double. He was going to have guaranteed millions in the bank and he did not take them. That's not normal for a player at all.\"",
      "Backing up this school of thought on Vibe with Five, Rio Ferdinand added: \"Do you know what I heard it was… he [Bellingham] wanted some assurances about being a first-team player and United weren’t willing to give him those assurances - that’s what I heard from a very good source. He wasn’t given assurances of being around the first team and he’s said, ‘do you know what, I know my worth, I know my value and if you don’t value me the way I see myself I’m going to have to jog on and go to another club’.\"",
      "Explaining in his own words why Dortmund was the right next step, Bellingham told The Telegraph. in 2020: \"Well, you know, Man United have a great squad but my decision had nothing to do with Man United,\" Bellingham said \"I was so focused and so happy with the interest from Dortmund that this became my first choice. For me, it was Borussia Dortmund and that’s it. When you find somewhere that’s the best place to be, you kind of ignore everything else, you know what I mean?\"",
      "Bellingham can certainly be considered one that got away for United - a feeling that will only grow stronger if he is to become a European champion with the whole world watching, no doubt including Sir Alex Ferguson.",

      "Manchester United will have a decision to make over Jadon Sancho's future as he is set to return to Old Trafford after Borussia Dortmund's Champions League final against Real Madrid",
      "There has been near-constant speculation over Jadon Sancho's long-term future since returning to Borussia Dortmund on loan in January.",
      "A feud with United boss Erik ten Hag saw Sancho's first-team involvement diminish and he was forced to secure first-team football away from Old Trafford. The 24-year-old returned to his former club as a result, and is expected to be involved in their Champions League final against Real Madrid on Saturday night.",
      "Under contract until 2026, Sancho's future will be discussed again upon his return to the club. Whether he stays at Old Trafford could depend on whether Ten Hag will remain in charge. The Dutchman's future is also up in the air as there is a chance that Sir Jim Ratcliffe could make a change ahead of next season.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest news surrounding Sancho.",
      "Sancho began his youth career at Watford at the age of seven. He was then picked up by Manchester City in 2015 but didn't make an appearance for the first-team before leaving to join Dortmund in 2017, aged just 17.",
      "He initially started playing for Dortmund's B team and a year later, he made his debut in the Bundesliga against VfL Wolfsburg. After four years and 157 appearances under his belt, he made the switch to Old Trafford for a £73million fee.",
      "Ten Hag and Sancho had a public falling out and it was claimed that the Dutch boss encountered 'issues' with the winger, who was signed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021.",
      "He was subsequently banished from the first-team and joined Dortmund in January for the remainder of the season. The Bundesliga outfit had their own discipline issues with Sancho during his first stint in the club and he had been known to be late to training at Carrington during his time with United.",
      "Explaining the situation, Ten Hag told Sky Sports at the time: \"He's now at Dortmund. So after he was signed, one year before [I was here], and there were issues. We have had issues all the way through, and so you can make out his stay at Manchester United so far is not a success.\"",
      "Asked if an apology from Sancho would have solved the situation, Ten Hag added: \"We have said that before and I don't want every time to return to the point. He knows what he should do and we have made that clear.",
      "\"It was also so clear and obvious about his performance so let's stop this discussion. He is at Dortmund and we wish him the best of luck.\"",
      "The England international has rediscovered his form at Signal Iduna Park, starting in 11 out of the 16 Bundesliga games he played in. Sancho has also started in all six Champions League games and could be set for another start in the final at Wembley.",
      "Dortmund boss Edin Terzic says he was not surprised by his qualities, as he became a key player for his team. \"It's maybe not so easy to bring it onto the field, especially when you haven't had rhythm for a while,\" Terzic said.",
      "\"We know his quality and we saw it again today. We knew we needed a performance like that from Jadon. I think that big games are decided by big players and tomorrow, he will have the opportunity to decide it.",
      "\"We are really happy with him. From all sides we are happy to have him in our team. I think you can feel that he is happy to be with us.\"",
      "Sancho's £73m signing on a five-year deal created an amortised cost in the club's annual financial accounts. However, United may likely need a sizeable fee to encourage them to sell and will want to recoup as much as possible.",
      "Ten Hag believes Sancho's improved form in Germany 'shows he represents a high value for United, which is good.' The Daily Mail add that Dortmund's presence in the Champions League final has triggered significant bonuses in his loan deal.",

      "Schalke are reported to have set a £12million release clause for any interested clubs from the English top flight.",
      "Ouedraogo is being touted as a potential solution to United's midfield. Donny van de Beek's future at Old Trafford is uncertain after spending the season on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt, while Casemiro has underwhelmed this season and could also be sold.",
      "The 18-year-old is one of the most highly-rated youngsters in Germany and broke into Schalke's first-team this season having joined the club at the age of eight. He went on to make 18 appearances in the Bundesliga second division.",

      "Man United have a platform to build on when attempting to strengthen their squad in this summer's transfer window.",
      "Despite Manchester United's collective struggles this season, voting for the winner of the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award was not straightforward.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was crowned the recipient of the award for a third time, but he was not without competition. Diogo Dalot finished a respectable second while Kobbie Mainoo, after an impressive breakout season, scooped the final spot on the podium.",
      "Had Dalot or Mainoo pipped Fernandes to the post, few could have expressed disapproval. Dalot was one of the most consistent performers in the squad and Mainoo's sharp rise was nothing short of astounding.",
      "Both players, alongside Fernandes, will have ambitions of challenging for the individual honour again next season. They are all expected to survive this summer's shake-up at Old Trafford, with Mainoo one of four names who have been etched on the club's list of untouchables.",
      "Portuguese duo Dalot and Fernandes have also made strong cases to bag places on that list, even if exits this summer are unlikely. Dalot chalked up 50 appearances this season just gone and Fernandes still managed to come up with 28 direct goal contributions (15 goals and 13 assists) in an underperforming team.",
      "United have not ruled out the addition of a right-back this summer, but they have far more pressing matters to address before considering strengthening that department. Dalot is one of the club's most consistent performers and has undoubtedly improved his all-round game since Erik ten Hag took charge in 2022.",
      "Fernandes is surely United's most important player. He is their architect-in-chief and his absence against both Crystal Palace and Arsenal last month highlighted just how much they miss him on the rare occasions he is unavailable.",
      "Alongside Mainoo, Fernandes completes two thirds of United's strongest midfield. He and Mainoo will both expect to be regular starters again next season regardless of who the manager is.",
      "With Dalot, Mainoo and Fernandes all strong candidates to remain regular starters on the other side of the summer hiatus, the same should be said for goalkeeper Andre Onana and defender Lisandro Martinez. For all of United's injury troubles this season, they missed the Argentine more than anyone, with Ten Hag regularly citing his absence.",
      "His capabilities in possession and full-blooded style of play make him one of United's most important operators. They will be desperate to keep him fit next season and find him a new centre-back partner following the exit of Raphael Varane.",
      "United want to sign two centre-backs this summer and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is high up on their wish list. Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba and Juventus star Gleison Bremer are also heavily linked, as is Jean-Clair Todibo of Nice.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United are also planning to strengthen their attacking options. There is an argument for them to add fresh blood both out wide and through the middle.",
      "However, Alejandro Garnacho's tally of 10 goals and five assists, plus his run of 39 consecutive starts to end the season, put him in a position where he should be expecting to start most weeks. At the age of only 19, he blossomed this season, establishing himself as one of the very first names on the teamsheet.",
      "The only question that should surround Garnacho is which side he should play on. He has equally flourished on both the right and left this season. United have been heavily linked with Michael Olise – who predominantly plays on the right – but Garnacho's sharp rise and United's preference to keep Marcus Rashford means signing Olise should not be the club's very top priority.",
      "Then they have Rasmus Hojlund, who ended his first season at Old Trafford with a very respectable 16 goals to his name. United invested up to £72million in him last year, with more than half an eye on the future. He's only just getting started.",
      "Hojlundshould retain his place as the club's first-choice striker, although some added competition would not go amiss. They have been linked with a crop of strikers in recent weeks, but it is hard to envision Hojlund being demoted in the pecking order.",
      "With Onana, Dalot, Martinez, Mainoo, Fernandes, Garnacho and Hojlund all in contention to remain starters next season, United may only have to plug a handful of gaps this summer. There is no questioning that United need new recruits, but they already have a foundation to build on.",

      "The former Ajax manager has been on the receiving end of bruising defeats and had high-profile dealings with some United stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho. After steering United to third place in the Premier League last season, they endured one of their worst domestic campaigns for over 30 years after managing an eighth-place finish this term.",
      "Despite that, Ten Hag's side upset the odds to beat Premier League champions and reigning FA Cup holders, Manchester City, to win the competition in May. The triumph at Wembley Stadium made it two pieces of silverware in his cabinet at Old Trafford, equalling the haul of former boss Jose Mourinho - who was in London for Saturday's Champions League final between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund.",

He will be tasked with responding to their dismal Champions League pursuit, that ended in the Group Stage last year, in the Europa League following their FA Cup triumph.",
      "The 54-year-old issued a steely response to sack claims, in light of their cup win last month, he said: \"If they don't want me any more, I go somewhere else and win trophies, that's what I've done my whole career.\"",
      "Mourinho's comments may have been directed at Ancelotti but the similarities could correlate with Ten Hag's tenure in the Premier League.

      "Former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho appears to have landed a new job in football",
      "Jose Mourinho is set for an awkward reunion with former Manchester United midfielder Fred as he edges closer to becoming Fenerbahce's new manager.",
      "Mourinho has been out of work since leaving AS Roma at the start of this year, though latest reports have suggested he is Turkey-bound for his latest challenge in the managerial world.",
      "If this proves to be the case, the Portuguese coach will link up with one of his former United players: Fred. The Brazilian midfielder was signed by Mourinho during the summer of 2018, though made only six Premier League starts under the 61-year-old.",
      "The pair's relationship turned sour towards the end of Mourinho's reign in December 2018 when Fred was taken off 57 minutes into a Champions League defeat at Valencia. It was reported at the time the United boss remarked \"your days at this club are numbered\", though it was Mourinho's time that would soon be up as he was sacked just six days later.",
      "LIVE: Utd could miss out on defender, Sancho and Greenwood updates",
      "Fred's lack of first-team minutes during this period led to him losing his place in the Brazil national team, something he found particularly challenging. Speaking at the time, the 31-year-old said: \"I've played very little at United, so it's normal for Professor Tite not to be able to evaluate me, even though I've worked hard with him before.",
      "\"Of course, I was annoyed, but I have to know how to deal with the sadness to be able to help me take a step forward. The coach has chosen not to put in the team. That's his choice. I still do my job and I can't let it affect my mindset, I cannot let that shake me. I have to be patient. It's been a difficult start for me at United because I have not been playing so much.\"",
      "Offering his own response as to why Fred was not featuring in his team, Mourinho told reporters: \"Step by step. You also have other players at other clubs that needed their time and you have some of them that play even less than what Fred is playing.",
      "\"I think Fred [will play more], when the team is defensively stronger and doesn't need in midfield people that are more worried about giving some balance to the team than being involved in creation and attacking dynamics. The day we are stronger defensively, I think the horizons for Fred change completely.\"",
      "The Telegraph previously suggested Fred was not a signing Mourinho wished to complete when at the Old Trafford helm six years ago, with the midfielder's talent being \"championed principally\" by former chief scout Mick Court.",

      "In January, it was reported that Napoli wanted £112m for their striker but with two years left on his contract and the Nigerian forward wanting to leave, that seems like a negotiable figure. Sir Jim Ratcliffe must understand that he would need to pay big money to gain the reliable goalscorer that United is crying out for.",
      "He may split opinion among United fans online but Marcus Rashford remains a noticeably popular figure at Old Trafford. The winger has not enjoyed the best season in the world and his decision to take a step back from social media and recharge should be praised.",
      "An in-form and focused Rashford remains an asset to United and if he can rediscover that form next season it could be the difference between eighth and top four. This summer is not the time for the Englishman to depart but rest assured this coming campaign is make or break for him.",

      "Man United and Newcastle have a strange rivalry centred around the biggest transfer snub of the formative Premier League years.",
      "For a Manchester United fan, the response to Alan Shearer's tweet was absolutely delicious. A quote from famous TV gameshow Bullseye saying, \"Look at what you would have won,\" next to an image of Sir Alex Ferguson proudly parading the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League trophies.",
      "There's little wonder it's still a raw subject for Shearer, who still gets asked about it to this day.",
      "“NEVER! I couldn’t stand them then and I can’t stand them now!!!” That was his tweet on the subject of regrets in his career, and whether snubbing United (twice) still rankled.",
      "His first opportunity to make the Old Trafford move came in 1992, with Shearer choosing Blackburn and United choosing Eric Cantona. The latter would swiftly help United win successive league titles and the FA Cup.",
      "But it was in 1996, when football (nearly) came home, that Ferguson would make his biggest play for the striker everybody wanted. Think Harry Kane or Erling Haaland now, Shearer was of that ilk. He would have taken Fergie's United to the next level.",
      "\"I'd actually done a deal as far as Alan Shearer's contract was concerned, we'd come to a settlement,\" said former United chairman Martin Edwards. \"Shearer had been to Ferguson's house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come. The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United, local rivals, both Lancashire clubs.",
      "\"He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don't think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I'm not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don't think that was a threat to him.\"",
      "Everyone knows the next bit. And the public perception wasn't that Blackburn had snatched Shearer from under the nose of United, it was viewed as a snub from Shearer. In reality, it was both.",
      "The fact he chose Newcastle, with whom he would become a club legend but win nothing, was the part that made United fans laugh. And, so the song goes, they signed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer instead.",
      "In more than a decade at the club after joining in the summer of 1996, Solskjaer won six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League in 1999, when his famous toe-poke secured the treble in dramatic style. That year, Newcastle finished 13th in the Premier League and United comfortably saw them off in the FA Cup final, 2-0 victors.",
      "\"Of course, I was tempted to join Manchester United, but I do not regret either decision,\" Shearer insisted recently. \"I had a magical time at Blackburn, winning the league. And I completed my own dream of playing for my home town club of Newcastle. I have memories I will hold forever and a goalscoring record that makes me extremely proud.\"",
      "Ferguson, who was initially incensed that Shearer wasn't convinced to come to Old Trafford — despite giving him assurances that he could have the No.9 shirt (but that he wouldn't be taking penalties, given Cantona's 100 per cent record from the spot) — didn't lose much sleep over it, in the end.",
      "“I thought that if they were the only things worrying him, we would get our man,\" he said. “History will prove whether he was right to pick Newcastle ahead of us.\"",
      "Only Shearer knows, deep down, whether he is truly at peace with his decision. United certainly didn't have many regrets in that period of history, but they weren't used to being snubbed.",
      "So when you hear 'Cheer up Alan Shearer', to the tune of 'Daydream Believer' by The Monkees, or the famous Solskjaer song ring around Old Trafford, just remember this saga and that Ferguson quote in particular. United fans have enjoyed goading Shearer for the best part of two decades. That isn't going to change soon.",

      "Man Utd have been heavily linked with Michael Olise of Crystal Palace, who has been called up by Thierry Henry for the Olympic Games.",
      "Michael Olise was Manchester United's tormentor in-chief a month ago, running riot at Selhurst Park as Crystal Palace inflicted a bruising 4-0 defeat on Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "Since then (and for a few weeks before in fact) Olise has been heavily touted for a move to Old Trafford this summer. The London-born forward signed a new four-year contract amid interest from Chelsea last summer, but could still be sold for the right price in the coming months.",
      "It is somewhat ironic that a former United tormentor, Thierry Henry – who played in a similar style to Olise – has thrown a potential spanner in the works. Around the same time that Olise signed an extension at Palace, the former Arsenal striker was appointed as the new manager of France's Under-21 side, with it agreed that Henry would also lead a French Under-23s team at this summer's Olympic Games in Paris.",
      "Henry has now named Olise, who qualifies for France as well as England, in his preliminary 24-man squad for the Olympics, with France set to play group games on July 24, 27 and 30. Others in the squad include Olise's Palace teammate Jean-Philippe Mateta, Bayern Munich prodigy Mathys Tel and Chelsea youngster Lesley Ugochukwu.",
      "The men's Olympic football final is not until August 9, so if France go all the way, Olise would likely miss the start of the Premier League season and play no part in pre-season whatsoever.",
      "It's an issue his current club manager Oliver Glasner has already addressed, speaking recently about Olise's potential selection for the Paris games. With Euro 2024 and the Copa America also impacting clubs' plans this summer, it's another hurdle for Palace to overcome – and potentially for United too, if they decide to pursue a transfer for Olise.",
      "“On the one side I would smile because we always want the best for our players,” said Glasner.",
      "“That they can play such a tournament is great for them personally, but for the manager’s heart it is bleeding because we want our players [back]. With the Euros, with the Copa America, we have players not available for at least the first three weeks, maybe four weeks, of pre-season, but you can ask all the clubs; they all have the same issue.",
      "“We have to give the players a rest whenever it is, whether he’s nominated for the Euros, whether he plays, whether he’s nominated for the Olympics and if he wants to go there; we have to give them some rest whenever it is.\"",
      "If Olise is given a two-week break, as is customary, after France potentially get to the Olympics final, he could be out of action until virtually the start of September. It could be worth thinking about for United when they're making their transfer plans for the summer.",

      "The youngster celebrated his 18th birthday in November and is the nephew of Alex Williams, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s as one of the first black goalkeepers in the modern top flight, making over 100 appearances for Manchester City in a trailblazing career.",
      "Williams is naturally a left winger, but he's occasionally played on the right this season and has also made 14 appearances for the Under-21s in the Premier League 2.",

      "United's academy continues to be at the forefront of youth development in 2024 and it has given something fans to be proud of in a challenging season for the first-team.",
      "The Under-18s have enjoyed an outstanding campaign and have won three trophies, beating rivals Manchester City to two, which made the victories even sweeter.",
      "\"It’s been a collective effort,\" Travis Binnion told the Manchester Evening News. \"Adam Lawrence and his staff deserve a lot of credit for this season, but we stick to the mantra of a single pool of players for the different youth teams and I really think we've done that.\"",
      "Binnion is the Under-21s manager but has the official title of head of player development and coaching, which means his remit goes beyond overseeing that age group.",
      "The 37-year-old won the FA Youth Cup in 2022, coaching a special group of players that included the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Willy Kambwala and Dan Gore, and has become a key figure in an academy that's considered among the best in world football.",
      "Binnion spoke to the MEN in November to reflect on the halfway point of the campaign and he kindly sat down again to discuss the end of the season for the academy. The success of U18s was the conversation's starting point and Binnion admitted there are similarities between the current crop and his team that won the FA Youth Cup.",
      "\"I think Louis Jackson is the only player to play in both and I was speaking to Jacko and his dad the other night about what a couple of good years he’s enjoyed,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"There are definitely some similar traits between those teams and I think any successful side must have goals, a competitive spirit and some really good players. This season's U18 side has some real high-potential players and both groups have that in common, as you'd expect from us.\"",
      "There have been five players from the FA Youth Cup winning team in 2022 to have been given senior debuts by Erik ten Hag and Binnion is confident the current U18 crop will produce more debuts - Ethan Wheatley has already been handed his in - in the near future.",
      "\"I’d expect it to happen,\" said Binnion about future debuts. \"I think the unknown is which ones, as some players emerge and some will slow down. I believe we can achieve the same number of debuts and I think what they do is actually more important than debuts.",
      "\"Garna, Kobbie, I believe Willy Kambwala, will play a lot of football for us. I think debuts are one thing, but sustained impact is another and I believe that will happen with this cohort.",
      "\"We expect it to happen, we don't just think or presume it will, but there's an expectation within the academy staff and club that it will happen. I think with that comes a bit of pressure to make sure they’re good enough and the debuts under Erik ten Hag haven't been easy debuts.",
      "\"There's been a lot of players training with the first-team and involvement in squads, but there haven't been loads of debuts, so what I’m saying is, training is one thing, but him putting you on the pitch is an indicator of whether he thinks you can help him and are good enough.\"",
      "Binnion continued: \"I look forward to working with any players as long as they have the right attitude. Usually, our kids’ attitudes are good and part of coaching is working between the ears, so making sure the environment is right, the attitude is right, and they’re focused.",
      "\"But like you alluded to earlier and with the Youth Cup team of two years ago, there's a lot of good kids in there, who rub off on each other and want to be successful. As long as you have that, with an aligned group of staff, players will maximise what they're capable of.\"",
      "Binnion coached Garnacho and Mainoo to Youth Cup success and both have established themselves as first-team regulars this season, performing well in the Premier League.",
      "Garnacho has started 37th successive games and his durability at 19 years old hasn't gone unnoticed. Binnion has watched him develop from a fresh-faced teenager who arrived from Atletico Madrid in 2020 to someone the first-team has relied upon to produce big moments.",
      "\"I think his dependability is the greatest quality he's added,\" Binnion said. \"As a young winger coming through and in his first 20 games, I was watching and wondering what we'd get out of possession, which was fine, but we knew there were high-level moments in there.",
      "\"Whereas now, I watch his pressing, tracking, positioning; durability and his robustness, and I think that's where the growth of his game has been. He still needs to do more in possession and he'll be aware of that, but look at how he did against Ben White the other day.",
      "\"His end product needs to be greater, but I thought he got the better of that duel and he's fazed by not going back the full-back at the first time, he'll just keep going and trying.\"",
      "When Binnion spoke to the MEN for the academy halfway season review, Mainoo had just made his debut in the Premier League against Everton at Goodison Park.",
      "The league campaign has now finished and Mainoo made 24 starts. The youngster has started almost every game in 2024 and his breakthrough must be celebrated.",
      "\"The way Kobbie plays the game is the way you coined it, a breath of fresh air,\" said Binnion. \"There is zero fear, he's really composed and has good all-round game understanding, so he's never going to be terrible in a game of football because he's too bright and too smart.",
      "\"He'll be more successful on some days than others, but am I surprised at his development? I'm not surprised at what I'm seeing, but how quickly he's got there and how he's established himself is naturally surprising because it's really hard to do that. That's the only surprising aspect",
      "\"How he's handled it and how he's playing is not a surprise and I think his mentality is why he can take it in his stride. Yeah, results have been up and down, but he's been a constant within good and poor performances, so he's learning and getting that extended run of opportunities.",
      "\"When he gets a chance to sit down and reflect on this season, he'll think about what has and hasn't gone well and what he needs to do better because he's a really bright lad. He's unassuming, smart and he'll only continue to get better, I've got no doubt about that.\"",
      "You get the impression when talking to members of academy staff they genuinely care about players and Binnion was at Wembley for Mainoo's debut for England.",
      "\"I went to the Brazil game, I went down to Wembley with my little boy when he made his debut,\" he said. \"I wasn't sure he was going to play, but I wanted to be down there anyways.",
      "\"I thought in the Belgium game he was their best player. Do his England performances merit him being in the squad this summer? I think yeah and I think his consistent performances for us in a difficult season bode well for him contributing toward a successful England team for sure. I’m not Gareth Southgate, but I'd be surprised if he’s not on the plane to Germany.\"",
      "Binnion meets with Les Parry, Darren Fletcher and Nick Cox each month to discuss academy loans and was insightful when discussing how certain spells away are viewed.",
      "\"Even with loans you've mentioned [Will Fish, Alvaro Fernandez, Joe Hugill and Radek Vitek], the perception is they've been successful because they've played or their team has done well, whereas some lads who have left on loan and haven't played appears really bad,\" he said.",
      "\"But it makes them realise where they’re at. Some boys are playing higher-level games and of course, we'd like them to all be successful, but I think realistically we know they’re not going to be and they can’t be because we’re not putting a gun to the heads of the managers.",
      "\"We don't say 'you must play our players'. I know that does happen, but I don’t think that's healthy and we'll continue to review each loan we do and analyse what happened.",
      "\"We'll think that wasn’t great because a player had three managers, but could we have foreseen that? No, OK, that team played that way, it suited that player, would we do that again?",
      "\"So it’s a reflection and planning for next year’s loans is what we’re in control of and we’ll endeavour to get it right. It’s been a real mixed level of success and that’s ok.",
      "\"I think sometimes people are too ready to say a loan has failed and suggest a player isn't good enough. A lot of loans at a lot of clubs aren’t successful, particularly the first ones.",
      "\"That doesn’t define how successful a player's career will be or how successful his next loan will be, so we make sure we're aware of why something happened and put it right.\"",
      "The MEN interviewed United youngster Will Fish in March and he spoke with great maturity. Impressively, the centre-back has made over 40 starts for Hibernian and has loved his time in Scotland, which has seen him play regular first-team football at a competitive level.",
      "Sources indicated his loan was 'very successful due to the volume of games played and against decent level of opposition' and Binnion reiterated that message.",
      "\"Will's undoubtedly for me been our most successful loan and you could argue that's been the case for two years and he’s going to get the rewards from that,\" Binnion said.",
      "\"People are aware of how well he’s doing. What I would add is that Will's first loan at Stockport wasn’t good in terms of minutes and exposure and then his start at Hibernian was tough.",
      "\"Who's to say he'd have that success without the learning from the first period? I think he’s a great example of the loan system and it’s a testament to him. When you say he’s gone under the radar, I think it’s because he’s quite low maintenance and profile as well.",
      "\"He's a great kid, he just wants to play football and have success. Hierbnian have been great for him, so he's in a really good place and there’s a lot of interest in him for future loans and coming back with us, the manager will have another look at him and see how he’s progressed.\"",
      "United recently made an academy visit to France and played behind-closed-doors friendlies with Monaco and INEOS-owned Nice, whom a partnership is being developed with.",
      "\"I know conversations with Jason Wilcox and Nick [Cox] are ongoing and obviously there’s a lot of knowledge there to share,\" said Binnion about the impact of INEOS.",
      "\"We went to Nice and played out there, we know what their expectations are and what resources they have and that can only be a good thing. Their standards and expectations are really high, they’re fully in support of what we do and acknowledge that we do a lot of good things.",
      "\"They want to keep supporting that and ultimately help us continue what we’ve been doing, which is maximising individual’s potential to play in our first-team and wider.",
      "\"The statistics that came out last week that showed the most Premier League minutes by academy players is further validation of the work we’re doing. We’ll keep moving forward and I can only see INEOS helping that, so we’re excited for the future with them onboard.",
      "\"We had some real high potential younger players and U19s who have had tough seasons with injuries on that trip to France and it was great to have that group together.",
      "\"It was away from the spotlight, good training, a nice part of the world, a new partnership with INEOS and we played Monaco as well, who historically we have a good relationship with. To go there and play two completely different sides was fantastic and we hope to do it again.\"",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "The club is running out of time to convince players like Earps that it's worth staying in Manchester long-term",
      "As the clock ticked down at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, the pocket of travelling Chelsea fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand opted to make Mary Earps the subject of their derision.",
      "\"Mary, what's the score?\" they crowed at the Manchester United goalkeeper, who cut a solitary, slightly despondent figure in her 18-yard box. The score, in fact, was 6-0 to Chelsea.",
      "It was United's heaviest defeat of the season and, just a week on from the Reds' FA Cup triumph at Wembley, it served as a chastening reminder of their deficiencies. Twelve months ago, there was little to separate these two sides but, in the balmy Manchester sunshine, the gulf in quality looked every bit as large as the 20-point gap between them would suggest.",
      "At the full-time whistle, Earps joined her teammates in parading the FA Cup trophy around the stadium but it was not quite the euphoric homecoming the United players had surely been hoping for. At the other end of the pitch, the away fans rubbed further salt into Earps' wound by striking up a chorus of 'England's No.1', directed at Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.",
      "While their serenade was more than a little tongue in cheek, the sentiment behind it was not as outlandish as it might have seemed last summer, when Earps won the Golden Glove at the Women's World Cup. Last month, England boss Sarina Wiegman gave the clearest indication yet that Earps' undisputed No.1 status was under threat when she gave Hampton the nod in the Lionesses' EURO 2025 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland.",
      "\"I think we're in a very luxurious position that we have two incredible goalkeepers,\" Wiegman said when quizzed on her decision to drop the United shot-stopper. \"As we saw with Mary (against Sweden), she did an incredible job but I also think that Hannah is doing a great job for Chelsea. She's growing into competition with Mary so this is a moment for her to shine.\"",
      "United's collective malaise this term has been such that it has been difficult for anyone in red to truly shine. After narrowly missing out on the Women's Super League (WSL) title in 2022/23, Marc Skinner's side have struggled to recover their best form and finished the season in fifth place - six points behind a Liverpool team who were plying their trade in the Championship only two years ago.",
      "It's little wonder, then, that Earps - whose contract expires this summer - is considering her future at the club. \"The honest reality is that conversations are still ongoing,\" the 31-year-old told Sky Sports News this week when asked about her next steps. \"I've been clear I don't want to make an emotional decision.",
      "\"The beginning of the season was really tough, I felt really upset about things that were being said about me and things that came out that weren't true.",
      "\"I've tried to be professional, keep my head down, work hard, get on with my job and that's been hard. I've been a punching bag at times. I know I've given my heart and soul for the whole season. It's a tough situation.",
      "\"I've asked the club for some confirmation on what they're trying to achieve and when I have those answers I'll be able to make a decision. It's up to the club.\"",
      "It's unsurprising that Earps has been feeling the heat of the media spotlight; she has been at the centre of intense transfer speculation since last summer, when it emerged Arsenal were interested in capturing her signature. That interest appears to have cooled of late, with the Gunners now reportedly preferring a move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar.",
      "But, while her form may have dipped slightly this season, Earps would certainly not be short of suitors should she choose to seek pastures new. She has been linked with French giants Paris Saint-Germain and her situation is being monitored by a host of top European clubs.",
      "That she appeared to put the ball in United's court in with her latest comments on her future is telling. The club came under fire last term for their inability to tie down first-team duo Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new deals, with the pair departing for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively.",
      "Though United's underwhelming campaign cannot solely be attributed to their exits, it was an indictment of the club's hierarchy that both were allowed to leave on free transfers. Now, the Reds risk losing Earps in the same manner, with the Daily Mail reporting last week that midfielder Ella Toone is also attracting interest from Barcelona.",
      "While that particular move may not materialise, with Toone under contract until June 2026, it is clear United need to do more to convince their star players that the club has a clear formula for success. Over the past 18 months, United has felt like a club in flux.",
      "In February, it was confirmed that head of women's football Polly Bancroft was set to depart at the season to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town. Matt Johnson, who currently works for the club's Foundation as well as overseeing the girls' regional and emerging talent centres (RTCs), is set to take over on an interim basis at the end of the campaign but Bancroft's long-term successor has not yet been named.",
      "Her exit comes after Skinner's highly-rated assistant Martin Ho left the club last summer to become head coach at Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner, while several other key personnel - including physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem and performance analyst Luke Wright - have moved over to join Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "This, of course, has all occurred against the backdrop of takeover uncertainty, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe eventually having acquired a minority stake in the club back in February The Ineos chief is now responsible for sporting operations, with United seeking to emerge into a brave new era under his stewardship.",
      "The fact that Ratcliffe chose to attend United's Premier League clash with Arsenal instead of watching Skinner's side lift their first piece of silverware earlier this month, however, does not instill confidence that the women's team ranks very highly on his list of priorities.",
      "Ineos director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford was in attendance on Saturday afternoon and will surely have been mildly perturbed by what he witnessed. The United hierarchy awarded Skinner - whose contract was due to expire this summer - with a new deal last week, although negotiations had been underway for some time.",
      "It was a controversial call considering the backlash Skinner has faced from some quarters of the fanbase at various points throughout the season and only time will tell whether the 41-year-old has what it takes to turn the Reds into a European force.",
      "\"I need to go away and reflect on what we need to do as a team,\" Skinner admitted in his post-match press conference at the weekend. \"I need to work with the club to make sure we know those areas. I've known for a while where we fall short, but there's also a time that you need to be able to develop those areas.\"",
      "For Skinner, there is at least the assurance he has another season to try and turn things around. But for United's decision makers, time is running out to convince players like Earps that it's worth staying in Manchester and the club need to show they have learnt from their mistakes before it is too late.",

      "Chelsea boss Emma Hayes says she is hopeful she can celebrate her team's Women's Super League (WSL) title triumph over a glass of wine with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "The former Manchester United man was in attendance at Old Trafford as the Blues romped to a 6-0 victory over Marc Skinner's side, pipping Manchester City to the title on goal difference. Though it was a difficult afternoon for United, it was heartening to see Ferguson's show of support for the women's team less than a week on from Sir Jim Ratcliffe's controversial absence at Wembley.",
      "And Hayes admitted she was looking forward to catching up with the legendary Reds boss after the match. Speaking to Sky Sports, she said: \"To finish here at Old Trafford, I hope to get a glass of wine with Sir Alex in a minute.",
      "\"Everyone told us we couldn't. Everyone said girls can't play, nor can they fill stadiums, nor can they get paid, nor can they create history.",
      "\"Not only are we not going away but we are going to fill them every week. Women's football now is a serious business and that for me is what it's about.\"",
      "It's not the first time Hayes has referenced her friendship with Ferguson. After the Chelsea manager announced her departure back in November, she said: \"He calls me from time to time so I wasn't surprised.",
      "\"Anything he says to me I always take with such pride. He is a legend of the game and someone whose opinion I value and he has a love of America.

      "Sir Alex Ferguson was in attendance at Old Trafford on the final day of the Women's Super League (WSL) season. With Manchester United hosting Chelsea, the influential figure made his presence at the ground felt.",
      "United and Mark Skinner had little to play for other than seeking to finish above Liverpool as fourth spot remained up for grabs. Just one week on from their FA Cup demolition of Tottenham at Wembley, the big names were out in force once again.",
      "Emma Hayes and Chelsea entered the game knowing that a win would give them a strong chance of claiming a fifth WSL title in a row. It is the last match in charge of the club for Hayes as she looks to leave with a bang.",
      "However, despite the positivity of Ferguson being at the ground, it was noticeable for many how that contrasted with the absence of Sir Jim Ratcliffe last weekend.",
      "Writing from Old Trafford, Reach PLC's women's football writer Beth Lindop said: \"If there's anyone who knows what it's like to leave a club while on top, it's Ferguson. The legendary Manchester United boss is at Old Trafford today to watch Skinner's side take on title-chasing Chelsea.",
      "\"But, while his heart may belong in the red corner, there might just be a part of him that is rooting for departing Blues boss Emma Hayes too.",
      "\"The soon-to-be US Women's National Team coach revealed last November that Ferguson had been in touch to wish her well ahead of her move Stateside. \"He calls me from time to time so I wasn't surprised,\" she said.",

      "UEFA rules say clubs owned by the same individual or legal entity cannot play in the same continental competitions; Man Utd have qualified for the Europa League along with fellow INEOS club Nice, while Man City are in the Champions League with sister club Girona - so what happens now?",
      "Monday 3 June 2024 08:01, UK",
      "Manchester United qualified for the Europa League by winning the FA Cup, but do they run the risk of being relegated to the Conference League?",
      "United beat neighbours Man City 2-1 in the Wembley final on May 25, a result which put them directly into the Europa League group stage, but they are set to be joined by French club Nice, who are also controlled by INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "UEFA rules provide strict guidelines on clubs being owned by the same ownership structure, with no two partnered teams allowed to play each other in the same competition.",
      "INEOS have released a statement since Man Utd lifted the trophy, which read: \"We are aware of the position of both clubs and are in direct dialogue with UEFA.",
      "\"We are confident we have a route forward for next season in Europe.\"",
      "With a similar situation affecting Manchester City and their sister club Girona, who have both qualified for the Champions League, Sky Sports takes a look at the rules and potential solutions for both clubs...",
      "Under UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, no individual or legal entity can have control or decisive influence over more than one club in the same UEFA competition.",
      "What does control and decisive influence mean? Well, there are four key parts of the criteria clubs have to meet: shareholders rights, financial support, club governance and transfers.",
      "Shareholders rights: The UEFA Club Financial Control Body says a club has decisive influence over another club if the party they fall under, eg. INEOS, holds at least 30 per cent of both clubs, or if they have at least 10 per cent and they are the largest shareholder in the club.",
      "Financial support: You have decisive influence if a club provides financial security to another club from borrowed money or if a club accounts to at least 30 per cent of the other club's total operating revenue.",
      "Club governance: You have decisive influence if an individual has a position in both of the clubs' governing bodies, which include chief executives, sporting directors, club presidents and chief financial officers.",
      "You also have decisive influence if a key figure in one club can remove members of the board, key executives and the first-team head coach at another club, as well as make key executive decisions across multiple clubs in terms of player transfers, deciding budgets and key commercial contracts.",
      "Player transfers: A club has decisive influence over another club if they have transferred three or more players to the other club, or if they share the same scouts or scouting database arrangements.",
      "If one of more of these criteria are met, then UEFA will make a more detailed assessment over whether decisive influence is being made, before making a decision over whether they can compete in the same UEFA competition.",
      "For Manchester United, new minority investor Sir Jim Ratcliffe - whose INEOS group controls the club's football operations and owns 27.7 per cent of the club - is also the majority shareholder at French club Nice.",
      "While Ratcliffe owns less than 30 per cent of United - therefore abiding by UEFA's rules through the shareholder rights, INEOS will need to prove to UEFA that they do not have decisive influence over both Nice and United through financial support and governance.",
      "The precise roles of Ratcliffe and other key figures such as Sir Dave Brailsford will likely be investigated, given they are both directly involved at United and Nice. However, United have also hired key individuals such as academy director Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada who are not involved at Nice.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester City and Girona have qualified for the Champions League group stage next season, with both teams owned by the City Football Group, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi United Group.",
      "The City Football Group are the majority shareholders of Premier League champions City, while they also own 44.3 per cent of LaLiga club Girona. Another 16 per cent of the Spanish club is owned by Pere Guardiola, the brother of City manager Pep.",
      "It looks likely that the City Football Group will need to reduce their stake in Girona in order for both teams to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "CFG have been offered several compliance options by Europe's governing body, which include selling parts of that stake in Girona to an independent third-party ownership via a UEFA-approved model to bring their ownership under 30 per cent.",
      "Meanwhile, the City Football Group could have decisive influence over both City and Girona due to their transfer dealings this season.",
      "Girona have also signed three players from CFG clubs this season, including right-back Yan Couto and midfielder Yangel Herrera directly from City. Brazilian winger Savio joined from another CFG club in Troyes and will reportedly move to City this summer, in a deal agreed in February.",
      "City sporting director Txiki Begiristain is also the director of football at CFG, though Girona do have their own separate sporting director in Quique Carcel.",
      "Both United and City's owners have until the June 3 deadline to arrange their ownership structure before presenting UEFA their plans regarding their partner clubs.",
      "An independent panel will then decide whether those partner clubs can appear in the same competitions, with a ruling to be made by the start of the Champions League qualifiers in the middle of July.",
      "It also means United and City are not allowed to sign or sell any players through Nice and Girona respectively while they are involved in these UEFA proceedings.",
      "If partner clubs fail to meet UEFA's criteria, only one of the two partner clubs can appear in the same competition.",
      "UEFA will then see which team qualified in the higher position in their league table as part of the criteria to determine which team gets to play in the higher tournament.",
      "In United's case, as Erik ten Hag's side finished in eighth place in the Premier League and Nice secured a fifth-placed spot in Ligue 1, then the French side would take the Europa League spot and United would be relegated to the Conference League.",
      "And as City finished top of the Premier League and Girona ended the LaLiga season in third spot, then the Spanish side would have to move to the Europa League, leaving just City in the Champions League.",
      "As per UEFA rules, a club which is not admitted to the competition is replaced by the next best-placed club in the top domestic championship of the same association.",
      "That would mean Chelsea would be promoted to the Europa League to take up United's spot, should INEOS fail to meet UEFA's criteria.",
      "And Athletic Bilbao would be the main beneficiaries of Girona not making the Champions League, as they would be promoted to Europe's top table courtesy of their fifth-placed finish in LaLiga.",

      "However, while also seeking a solid defensive midfielder and striker this summer, United need to box clever - financially - in the upcoming transfer window and have to bolster what they can spend with sales.",
      "Branthwaite is thought to be valued in the region of £60m-£70m by Everton, who must sell one of their main assets before the end of June to stay in line with PSR.",
      "Another player who could fetch a sizeable fee is Amadou Onana - but no move has yet emerged for the midfielder.",
      "It means Branthwaite may become the more likely player to attract offers before June 30, and he has also been tracked by Manchester City and Tottenham.",
      "Spurs looked very closely at signing Branthwaite before the January transfer window but ended up buying Radu Dragusin from Genoa, although they do want another centre-back this summer.",

      "Read more from Melissa Reddy's analysis here.",
      "With Erik ten Hag's future still in the balance, Manchester United's inevitable summer of upheaval could see additions in all areas of the pitch - they have struggled both defensively and offensively.",
      "The departure of the experienced Raphael Varane will leave the club light at the back, especially with Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw's ongoing injury concerns.",
      "They used 14 different centre-back partnerships this season and veteran Jonny Evans clocked more league appearances than any other centre-back at the club. So, a keen eye will be cast over a defence that conceded a Premier League club-record 58 goals this term.",
      "The 2024 summer transfer window in the Premier League officially opens on Friday June 14 - the same day that Euro 2024 starts.",
      "The window will close on August 30 at 11pm UK time.",
      "The Premier League has brought forward Deadline Day to link up with the other major leagues in Europe. The closing dates were set following discussions with the leagues in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and France."

      "Jadon Sancho returns to Wembley with Borussia Dortmund having rediscovered himself after Manchester United struggles. Back at the scene of the Euro 2020 final, Sancho appears in the mood for a very different ending since going back 'home'",
      "Saturday 1 June 2024 20:13, UK",
      "A Champions League final at Wembley comes laced with meaning for many associated with Borussia Dortmund. Marco Reus and Mats Hummels played in their defeat there to Bayern Munich in 2013. Edin Terzic, now the manager, was in London as a fan.",
      "The stadium holds slightly different emotions for another among the Dortmund squad tasked with providing a better ending against Real Madrid on Saturday. For Jadon Sancho, his Wembley final was more than disappointing. It was the night everything changed.",
      "Brought on by Gareth Southgate in the 120th minute of England's European Championship final against Italy, Sancho had been introduced to take a penalty. His shot was saved, his team lost and he was the subject of horrendous racist abuse in the aftermath.",
      "Just 12 days later, his £73m move to Manchester United was confirmed. He arrived as perhaps the most exciting young prospect in European football after scoring 50 goals and providing 64 assists in 137 games for Dortmund. He was still only 21 years old.",
      "Events since have conspired to mean that despite earning the right to walk out at Wembley again in the biggest game in European club football, he does so having long since lost his place in the England squad - and not with United but back on loan at Dortmund.",
      "The story of what happened in the intervening period depends on who you ask. For some, Sancho was a victim of the United malaise. Expected to turn up and turn it on, he found a team lacking in structure, an environment not conducive to allowing him to thrive.",
      "Sancho had never been a soloist despite those slaloming runs from deep. At Dortmund, he had full-backs overlapping to create space and a centre-forward willing to exchange passes and provide movement. At United, it was just give him the ball and wait.",
      "Others would point to talk of tardiness that predated his arrival, whispers of a questionable attitude. Omitted by Erik ten Hag on the grounds of training-ground performance, Sancho pushed back, refused to apologise and found himself frozen out of the squad.",
      "It remains remarkable, something alluded to by former Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp as he left Liverpool. \"I cannot just buy into that 'he's useless' stuff - like other clubs did by the way,\" he said. \"Buying a player for £80m and then sending him out on loan!\"",
      "But whatever the situation says about United it did not reflect well on Sancho, either, and a response was required. Dortmund, it seems, was the best place from where to provide one. He immediately cut a different figure on his return to Germany. \"Dortmund is home to me,\" he declared.",
      "The club where he had made his name seemed to intuitively understand their role in helping him to show his talent, rediscover his true self. \"Jadon is a player that needs to smile,\" noted Terzic. \"If he is smiling then he is going to shine on the pitch.\"",
      "Dortmund eased him back at first but they played him into form. It has not been a tour de force, with two goals and two assists in his 14 Bundesliga appearances, but there have been glimpses of the talent that once lit up their stadium. He has felt valued again.",
      "Speaking to Jurgen Klinsmann about this, he emphasised the human aspect. \"Jadon obviously had a rough time finding his rhythm again and settling back again. We often forget that these very talented young players are just human beings,\" he told Sky Sports.",
      "\"When they go from one extreme to another and do not find their form in one place and something is not working or clicking and then they decide to go back to the place they came before, it takes time to adjust and get their confidence and form back.",
      "\"In that situation, I think that it is really important that the manager is patient with the player, that the manager lets the player do their thing and is there to help but not putting them too much under pressure to perform right away at the highest level.\"",
      "His importance to Dortmund is illustrated by the statistics. Sancho has completed 36 dribbles in the Bundesliga since his return - ranking third in the competition in that time - and has created more chances from open play than any other Dortmund player.",
      "But it is in the Champions League that he has really impressed. It was in this competition, in a 2-0 win over PSV in March, that he scored his first goal back in front of those Dortmund supporters. Against Paris Saint-Germain, in the semi-final, he was outstanding.",
      "His 13 completed dribbles in the first leg were not only the most by a player in a Champions League game this season, they were more than anyone else in the previous two seasons as well. In fact, only Eden Hazard and Neymar have topped that figure in the past decade.",
      "Confidence restored, Sancho was running at defenders with purpose again, full of energy on and off the ball. Since returning, he has blocked more passes than anyone else in the Champions League and ranks second in the competition for recovering possession.",
      "Klinsmann speaks for everyone when he says that it is a joy to see him like this. \"[He has shown] that he can perform at the highest level he has shown in the past in his young career. So I was really pleased that he picked up the pace now and is looking good, looking sharp.\"",
      "All that remains is a fitting ending. Three years on, he can close the loop with another big performance against Real Madrid, making history at the club that helped make him a star, at the stadium where the dream started to unravel. Back at Wembley. Just back."

      "There has been enough evidence of clubs publicly messing up their succession planning in the last few months - Bayern being the chief example - and United do not want to repeat that.",
      "They would say they are simply exploring options and doing due diligence. However, if you are not minded to part with your manager, why are you engaging the representatives of those who you'd like to replace him? And how should he feel knowing the club are doing so while he doesn't have clarity over his future?",
      "It is perfectly normal and understandable that a new leadership group would want their own pick as manager, but people close to Ten Hag have been annoyed by a lack of communication and \"personal and professional respect.\"",
      "Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel, both of whom have been heavily considered in the past. However, as Sky Sports reported last month, a source pointed out there are reservations that no other big club plumped for the German once Bayern Munich announced he was leaving.",
      "It also hasn't escaped decision-makers that bar Mainz, all of Tuchel's tenures have been only around the two-year mark or under.",
      "The situation at Chelsea sparked United into action. Pochettino's availability was unexpected and he has long had huge admirers at the club but is also very highly thought of by Brailsford, Sir Jim Ratcliffe - and Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Chelsea's interest in Kieran McKenna also pushed United to act and meet with his representatives, however Sky Sports News understands he is set to sign a long-term contract at Ipswich.",
      "His strong affinity with and intimate knowledge of United, aligned with his phenomenal work at Ipswich, marked him as an attractive, albeit risky option. It is understood that he would not have chosen Stamford Bridge over Old Trafford if he had offers from both.",
      "Thomas Frank has also appealed to United for his shapeshifting, building an attacking machine in the Championship to a more defensive-minded, effective unit to consolidate Premier League status, his rapport with supporters, the improvement of players like Ivan Toney, David Raya and Ezri Konsa and outperforming budget and expectations. His direct style of football would suit the squad.",
      "They are, which makes it hard to nail the profile INEOS are after. And that is not the extent of options being looked at as they properly investigate what and who would be possible.",
      "As was known months ago, the chance of pinching Gareth Southgate from England after the Euros had been explored, and Jean-Claude Blanc's extensive contact book has been used to gain insights over other candidates.",
      "There has been the expectation that given his availability and Pep Guardiola's assertion that he is \"one of the most influential managers in the last 20 years\", a conversation will be held with Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "I should point out, there are many at United who have worked closely with Ten Hag and want him to continue. They believe he has handled all manner of turbulence since walking through the door quite well and is the least of the club's problems.",
      "United's hierarchy have been quite insistent that the decision over Ten Hag will be based on the entirety of his time in charge not the result of Saturday's showpiece.",
      "Yes, with another piece of silverware - and doing so against all odds to deny Manchester City the double-double.",
      "It wasn't just about the result, it was a near-perfect performance from United; they were aggressive and dynamic, were exceptional with their defensive organisation and really preyed on City's weaknesses.",
      "It was a small window into Ten Hag's vision of turning them into \"the best transition team in the world\" and also pointed to what the manager had been saying all season: a solid central defensive partnership and having players available for selection would make a significant difference. Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez at the heart of defence were the platform United built off on Saturday.",
      "On a human level, the scenes were also brilliant; seeing Ten Hag happy and enjoying himself with a heap of adoration from the likes of Alejandro Garnarcho, Kobbie Mainoo, Luke Shaw, Scott McTominay, Bruno Fernandes and Martinez.",
      "The fact that United are engaging with the representatives of other managers speaks louder than anything else. INEOS have shown from all the changes they've already made to the football structure that they want a fresh path forward - their own path.",
      "But can they get an agreement with the candidate they really want, will it make financial sense, and would they get buy-in from supporters?",
      "Those are all considerations and if they can't nail that, perhaps Ten Hag will remain in play. But I'd refer back to the first line of this answer."

      "Maguire has been a pivotal figure in England's last three tournaments in which they've reached a semi-final, final and quarter-final.",
      "But rewind to 2018 ahead of the World Cup in Russia and this was a different England.",
      "An England with no expectations, almost a joyful atmosphere in believing it would be another doomed tournament.",
      "\"It was a new group in 2018,\" Maguire said as he sat down with Sky Sports News.",
      "\"Gareth was at the start of building something - the expectation was probably just to get out of the group but we played really well in that tournament and we set a good foundation.",
      "\"It was a great time for me, a time where I probably moved up a level in terms of playing at the top level in football and it was an amazing time.\"",
      "England eventually lost to Croatia in the semi-finals but as Maguire alluded to, a creation of unfiltered optimism came from that competition and expectations around this England squad continued to grow.",
      "Now they will go to Germany with an impressive run of tournament performances behind them, with a manager the players undoubtedly trust, while also embracing the tag of being one of the strongest teams in the competition.",
      "Maguire explained: \"He did a lot of little things, he knew how important it was to bring the group together, make everyone enjoy the camps, make everyone want to play for their country - and of course that's the way it should be.",
      "\"It's a good time to be an England player, we feel we're in a good moment and it's a tournament I'm looking forward to - we're going there to win.\"",
      "England seem to have the basics to win the competition. The foundations have been built in previous tournaments under Southgate.",
      "\"It's a good time to be an England player,\" Maguire said. Clearly the atmosphere within the squad and the experiences they have shared in years gone by have gelled this group in a different way to England squads of the past.",
      "However, if there is one blemish for this England side under Southgate - on the biggest of occasions, in the biggest encounters - they have fallen just short.",
      "Empathy is there though for England - in the last three competitions, they have lost to the finalists (Croatia 2018, France 2022) or eventual winners (Italy 2021).",
      "But if this England side are to create their own legacy and history - how can they provide a different outcome this time around compared to the previous gut-wrenching losses?",
      "\"I think all three of the games we've lost in those tournaments could have gone either way,\" Maguire said.",
      "\"Playing a tournament is totally different to playing league football - it's built on moments and you've got to make sure you're there within the game to let the moments take over.",
      "\"That's where your big players come to play and produce those magic moments.",
      "\"You just need to make sure you're there to make it and perform on the day to give yourself an opportunity to go and win.\"",
      "This England side have stars in abundance, whether it is the captain Harry Kane, the four-in-a-row Premier League winners Phil Foden and Kyle Walker or the young emerging talent of Kobbie Mainoo, who put a in a player-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final.",
      "But perhaps no England player has had a more impactful season on their club than Jude Bellingham.",
      "It was expected that he would need time to settle at Real Madrid but he has became a pivotal figure at the Bernabeau, scoring 19 goals and providing six assists as they reclaimed the LaLiga title.",
      "\"Jude is an amazing player - a real big leader, a great personality and obviously very talented on the pitch,\" Maguire said.",
      "Jude Bellingham faces former club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final having helped fill Real Madrid's Karim Benzema void.",

      "Bellingham's statistics are pretty impressive for his first season at Real Madrid, and as Maguire is talking, he's wearing one of the specialised STATSports vests which collect a huge amount of data to monitor training performance and workload.",
      "With statistics becoming an increasingly greater part of football, one wonders how much a footballer pays attention to them.",
      "Maguire said: \"Yeah, especially over recent years, football is about stats.",

      "Few flaws can be found in a team who have finished runners-up to Manchester City in successive seasons. However not a single Arsenal player has surpassed 16 Premier League goals in four campaigns.",
      "This season, Kai Havertz's return of nine goals in his final 14 league appearances this season was promising, but Eddie Nketiah and Gabriel Jesus failed to reach double figures between them from a combined 54 league appearances, with neither finding the net after January.",
      "Aston Villa will compete in Europe's elite competition next season for the first time since 1982/83 when they were reigning European champions.",
      "Their defensive record will surely need improvement to reach such heights again. They started and ended the season conceding five goals at Newcastle and Crystal Palace, while no team has conceded more Premier League goals when qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Only Norwich - who finished third in the inaugural Premier League campaign - have ever finished in the top four and conceded more goals.",
      "Bournemouth won a club-record 48 Premier League points this season. After a slow start under Andoni Iraola, the Cherries took 42 points from their final 27 league games - a total bettered only by the top four and Chelsea.",
      "Next season's success could depend on retaining top scorer Dominic Solanke as much as any potential incomings. The former Liverpool and Chelsea forward featured in all 38 league games this season - the only Bournemouth player to do so.",
      "Not only were his 19 league goals more than twice as many as any team-mate, but, without them, Bournemouth would have finished 17th in the table - only six points clear of relegation.",
      "This season was Brentford's lowest finish (16th) and points total of their three Premier League campaigns (39) - they won just five of their final 24 league games.",
      "For the first half of the season, they caught a glimpse of life without talisman Ivan Toney - something likely to become a permanent feature this summer with only one year left on his contract.",
      "Thomas Frank has acted fast with the signing of Brazilian striker Igor Thiago being confirmed in February. Only Kevin Denkey scored more league goals in Belgium's top tier this season than Thiago, whose conversion rate was nearly three times that of his potential predecessor.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi's departure maintains the club's customary seasonal churn within its ranks.",
      "Over the past two years, Brighton have seen key players Marc Cucurella, Yves Bissouma, Leandro Trossard, Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo depart for significant fees, with Graham Potter following suit in September 2022.",
      "The constant changes have been reflected on the pitch: they made 36 more changes to their starting XI than any other team in the division - only one behind the Premier League record.",
      "Stability and consistency next season could be as important as any new signing.",
      "Chelsea showed signs of progress in the final three months - losing only one of their final 15 league games - but their young squad would benefit from an injection of experience if the top four is a realistic aim.",
      "Thiago Silva, now 39 years of age, will follow Mauricio Pochettino out of the club once his contract expires at the end of June.",
      "The Blues had the youngest average starting XI in the division this season - despite the Brazilian starting 27 games. Replacing him will be key: they conceded eight more goals than any previous Premier League campaign.",
      "Crystal Palace had lost 10 of their previous 17 league games when Oliver Glasner was appointed in February. Following his first game in charge, only Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea won more points.",
      "This transformation was primarily due to the remarkable form of Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who scored a combined 23 league goals in 13 games under the Austrian.",
      "Keeping hold of their attacking trio - and keeping Olise fit - could be the Eagles' best business this summer.",
      "Without the eight-point deduction, Sean Dyche's team would have finished within touching distance of the top half - winning four of their final six league games.",
      "However, their reliance on set-piece goals will need addressing if a fourth successive relegation dogfight is to be avoided.",
      "The Toffees scored five fewer open-play goals than rock-bottom Sheffield United and easing the burden on Dwight McNeil as their only natural, creative outlet should be a priority.",
      "Fulham's hopes of European football disappeared with just two wins in their final nine Premier League games. The Cottagers' late-season slump could be attributed to having the oldest starting XI in the division and using the joint-fewest number of players.",
      "Some younger legs and depth would not go amiss if Fulham were to push for a return to the top half next season.",
      "Successive promotions from League One to the Premier League means expectations at Portman Road are likely to be realistic next season: only six members of their current squad have played previously in England's top tier.",
      "A key issue for Luton this season was the lack of experience at this level, something Kieran McKenna would be wise to address this summer.",
      "The Foxes' surprise relegation in 2022/23 was primarily due to their defensive issues. At the other end of the pitch, their 51 league goals matched seventh-placed Aston Villa.",
      "However, their top two scorers that season - Harvey Barnes and James Maddison - departed last summer and the third top scorer, Kelechi Iheanacho, is out of contract this summer.",
      "The burden will be on Jamie Vardy, but, at 37, and after struggling in the Premier League last time out, a guaranteed goalscorer seems a must as Leicester boasted the best defence in the Championship this season.",
      "A summer rebuild was already touted at Anfield before Jurgen Klopp's departure after a trophy-laden eight years at Liverpool.",
      "After a midfield shake-up last summer, the focus is likely to be on defensive reinforcement: Virgil van Dijk's future remains uncertain, Joel Matip's contract has expired, Trent Alexander-Arnold is entering the final 12 months of his current deal and Andy Robertson's injury issues remain a concern.",
      "Their defensive stats this season are noticeably worse than in recent years.",
      "After winning an unprecedented fourth successive top-flight English league title, Manchester City will be hard-pressed to find any major flaws ahead of the summer.",
      "With Kalvin Phillips expected to depart after two underwhelming seasons, a deputy for the influential Rodri could be a priority: all three of City's league defeats came when the Spaniard was suspended this season.",
      "With Erik ten Hag's future still in the balance, Manchester United's inevitable summer of upheaval could see additions in all areas of the pitch - they have struggled both defensively and offensively.",
      "The departure of the experienced Raphael Varane will leave the club light at the back, especially with Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw's ongoing injury concerns.",
      "They used 14 different centre-back partnerships this season and veteran Jonny Evans clocked more league appearances than any other centre-back at the club. So, a keen eye will be cast over a defence that conceded a Premier League club-record 58 goals this term.",
      "Balancing expectations and Europe was always going to be a challenge for Eddie Howe's side this season. They conceded nearly twice as many league goals this campaign (62) compared to 2022/23 (33), when they had the joint-best defence in the division.",
      "Both full-back positions have been problematic of late and freshening up the backline seems likely - especially if they can retain the services of Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak.",
      "Nuno Santo Espirito's impressive defensive record at Wolves helped persuade Nottingham Forest to appoint him mid-season after axing Steve Cooper. He appeared unconvinced about his goalkeeper options and signed Matz Sels in January.",
      "The Belgian has struggled since joining Forest, with only team-mate Odysseas Vlachodimos and Brighton's Jason Steele registering lower save ratios this season.",
      "A consistent presence between the sticks would help complement an attack that began to gel on the home stretch.",
      "Southampton failed to score in only five Championship games this season - the best record in the division.",
      "The Saints often depended on their potent attack to bail out a defence that ranked midtable for goals conceded and clean sheets. Experience and quality at the back are imperative to avoid a second relegation in three seasons.",
      "Another false dawn at Tottenham, who were top of the table and unbeaten after 10 Premier League games under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Their capitulation in the 4-1 home defeat against Chelsea in November became the norm as the season progressed. Their defensive stats in the final 28 games resembled a team in a relegation battle.",
      "Better midfield protection and competent defensive depth are required - if they are to stand any chance of fighting for a top-four finish next term.",
      "With Lucas Paqueta potentially facing a multi-year ban for alleged breaches of betting rules, replacing the Brazil international's creative qualities would be essential.",
      "Paqueta made six times as many through-balls as any team-mate this season and was comfortably their most potent creator from open play.",
      "Only the three relegated teams conceded more goals than West Ham this term, and Paqueta's skillset was one of the key factors behind their ninth-placed finish.",
      "A steady but unspectacular debut season for Gary O'Neil ended in disappointment: his team won just one of their final 10 league games.",
      "Goals were rarely an issue for a team boasting the talents of Pedro Neto, Matheus Cunha and Hee-Chan Hwang, but a defence that kept just one clean sheet in their final 17 games will need work if they are to arrest their poor form when the new season arrives.",
      "The 2024 summer transfer window in Premier League officially opens on Friday June 14 - the same day that Euro 2024 starts.",
      "The window will close on August 30 at 11pm UK time.",
      "The Premier League has brought forward Deadline Day to link up with the other major leagues in Europe. The closing dates were set following discussions with the leagues in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and France."

      "Victory also secured a place in the Europa League next season.",
      "When questioned about his future after the game, Ten Hag said: \"I don't think about this. I'm in a project and we are exactly where we want to be.",
      "\"We are constructing a team and when I took over, it was a mess at Man Utd. We are now on our way to constructing a team for the future.",

      "\"The team also plays to an identity, but you need the players to be available. You need a strong squad in top football, especially when you play in England and in Europe. The Premier League is so competitive, so you need a very good squad, and you need the players available in that squad.",

      "When asked if the club needs stability after appointing five permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure, Ten Hag replied: \"When you see the last decade, there were not so many finals for this club, there were not so many trophies for this club and there were not so many talents coming through into the first team with high potential.",
      "\"But also, in the middle group, they developed this season very well. Think about Diogo Dalot as an example. There are also others.",
      "\"We strengthened the squad by our coaching and with our training. But also, we still need transfer windows to bring better players in and also players who are always available or often available.",
      "\"When the players are not robust enough, and this season the players were not robust enough, you cannot deliver consistent performances.\"",

      "It would be no surprise if indeed part owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe had come to that conclusion. Manchester United's eighth-placed finish was their worst in the Premier League era; their points total the lowest. It had been a desperately poor campaign.",
      "But Ten Hag has at least given him pause for thought. The Dutchman is adamant it would have been different if not for their injuries. This victory, in which returning trio Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez and Marcus Rashford played key roles, offered some vindication.",
      "Ten Hag can point to those circumstances, and a record of two trophy wins in two years. He can point to the development of Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho under his watch. But it remains to be seen whether there are too many red flags for Ratcliffe."

      "Erik ten Hag put speculation over his future to one side by leading Manchester United to FA Cup glory with a stunning 2-1 victory over Premier League champions Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "Much of the build-up to the game had centred around Ten Hag's future with reports on Friday suggesting United had decided to part company with the Dutchman regardless of the result in the showpiece final.",
      "If it was to be his final match in charge, the United players gave him the ultimate send-off as first-half goals from Alejandro Garnacho, who pounced on a calamitous mix-up between Josko Gvardiol and Stefan Ortega, and Kobbie Mainoo left Pep Guardiola's side stunned.",
      "Manchester City tried to find a way back into the game in the second half, but Erling Haaland's strike rattled the crossbar before Andre Onana twice kept out long-range efforts from Kyle Walker. However, Onana couldn't keep out substitute Jeremy Doku's strike as City pulled a goal back in the 87th minute to set up a grandstand finish.",
      "The City fans roared as seven minutes of stoppage time were announced by the fourth official, but it was United fans celebrating at the sound of the full-time whistle as their side held on to stop their rivals from becoming the first side to secure back-to-back league and FA Cup doubles.",
      "FA Cup glory sees United add a second piece of silverware under Ten Hag, following up their Carabao Cup win from last season. It also sees Manchester United put a disappointing league season behind them by sealing Europa League qualification, but the question remains as to whether Ten Hag will lead them into next season.",
      "Manchester United's FA Cup win means they will play in the Europa League next season and Newcastle miss out on European qualification.",
      "When asked about his future after the game, Ten Hag said: \"I don't know. All I can do is prepare my team, develop my team, progress my team. This is a project. When I came in it was a mess, now we are better. But we are by far where we want to be.",
      "\"Football is about winning trophies. I want to play the best football. I want to play dynamic football. But you have to win games and trophies. That's the mentality we've brought in. We only had one opportunity, the FA Cup and we did it. I'm so proud of the players and staff.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag shrugged off speculation surrounding his future to inspire a stunning Man Utd FA Cup triumph over Man City.",
      "Meanwhile, former Man Utd captain Roy Keane hopes the club back Ten Hag after the FA Cup win.",

      "In what was a breathless start to the game, Marcus Rashford looked to burst through on the Manchester City goal only to be denied by Walker, before the game's first huge flashpoint came.",
      "Bernardo Silva's cross was aimed at Haaland, who appeared to be bundled over by Lisandro Martinez in the penalty area. Referee Andy Madley waved away the huge Manchester City appeals, and the check of the incident by VAR didn't lead to a review in what was a big call so early on in the match.",
      "After that early scare, Manchester United settled into the game well. As expected, Pep Guardiola's side dominated the ball, but United looked well drilled and poised to strike on the counter. The first shot on target in the game fell to Ten Hag's side with Bruno Fernandes picking out Garnacho on the right, but the winger's shot was straight at goalkeeper Ortega.",
      "Manchester City were uncharacteristically sloppy with simple passes not finding their target, and it was a huge mix-up at the heart of the City defence which led to the opening goal of the game.",
      "Garnacho chased a routine ball over the top of the Manchester City defence before a calamitous mix-up between Gvardiol and Ortega allowed the Argentine winger to finish into an empty net. It's a moment Gvardiol, who headed the ball over the onrushing Ortega, and the goalkeeper will want to forget.",
      "The United celebrations got even louder just before the break as Mainoo's strike extended the lead. Rashford started the move with a fine cross-field pass to Garnacho before Fernandes' deft flick teed up Mainoo to send United into the break in dreamland.",
      "Guardiola reacted to City's sluggish performance with a double change at the break as Manuel Akanji and Doku replaced Mateo Kovacic and Nathan Ake. The champions were looking for an instant response and they almost got one through Haaland, but his strike rattled the crossbar as United's two-goal advantage stayed intact.",
      "Guardiola was forced into another huge call as City looked for a way back into the contest, replacing the ineffective De Bruyne with Julian Alvarez with 56 minutes on the clock. The chances started to come for City but the goals didn't follow. Andre Onana pulled off a stunning save to keep out Kyle Walker's powerful effort before Alvarez poked wide of the far post to leave Guardiola with his head in his hands.",
      "City eventually got a lifeline when Doku's low shot squeezed past Onana late on but it proved to be just a consolation as United held on to win the FA Cup for a 13th time in their history.",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag:",
      "\"All compliments to the team. We played very good to our identity. Very strong. You have seen how we can play when we have the players on board. Some were not even match fit but the performance was very good.",

      "\"With a local rivalry it's there and it's much more important when you play a team from your own city. But for us it wasn't about this, it was to prove a point after so many setbacks. The team showed so much resilience and I'm proud of them.\"",
      "On if criticism of his team has been unfair: \"I think so. The team. Me as well. It was not right.",

      "\"We are disappointed today. It's normal when a team loses the final, but this season has been extraordinary.",
      "\"We have challenged for all the trophies in a good way. We now need to rest and come back.\"",
      "The 2023/24 season has reached its conclusion but planning has already started for the new campaign.",
      "Several Premier League sides have confirmed pre-season friendlies ahead of the 2024/25 term, which kicks off on the weekend of August 17/18, while others have given fresh kits an early airing.",
      "The domestic season starts the previous weekend and marks the launch of Sky Sports +, giving more choice to sports fans via live streams and a new dedicated channel, at no extra cost. In a broadcasting first, every game in the Championship, League One and League Two will be streamed live on the opening weekend of the 2024/25 EFL season.",
      "Euro 2024 is just weeks away, too. Keep track of England's Euro fixtures, check out the full tournament schedule in Germany and join us on skysports.com"
