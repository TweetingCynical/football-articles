      "Jose Mourinho is 'surprised' by Manchester United's decision(Image: Stefano Guidi/Getty Images)",
      "Jose Mourinho has fired a dig at Manchester United after they appointed Michael Carrick as their new interim manager. Carrick, 44, has been given the job on a temporary basis after the Red Devils sacked Ruben Amorim earlier this month.",
      "His only previously managerial experience came at Middlesbrough, where he spent just under three years and reached the Championship play-offs in his first season. Carrick was also an assistant at United under both Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "After hanging up his boots in the summer of 2018, the ex-midfielder was welcomed into Mourinho's coaching staff. They worked alongside each other for six months before Mourinho was sacked.",
      "Despite his connection with Carrick, the current Benfica boss has admitted 'surprise' at United's decision to appoint him. Mourinho argues that more experienced managers should be given the most high-profile jobs.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "After Benfica lost 2-0 away Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, the 62-year-old said: \"For me, it is a surprise when coaches with no history and no work done have the opportunity to coach the most important teams in the world; this is the real surprise.",
      "\"When [AC] Milan takes [Max] Allegri, when Juventus takes [Luciano] Spalletti or when Roma chooses [Gian Piero] Gasperini, these are never surprises.\"",
      "Carrick has until May to convince the United hierarchy that he's the man for the long term. The five-time Premier League winner got off to the perfect start on Saturday.",
      "Will Michael Carrick get the Manchester United job permanently? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Michael Carrick was part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff(Image: GLYN KIRK/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "United produced a brilliant performance to beat Manchester City 2-0, boosting their hopes of finishing in the top five. Carrick's next assignment is a trip to league leaders Arsenal, who he notably beat during a three-game spell as caretaker after Solskjaer was dismissed in 2021.",
      "\"It was a very special day but I'm not getting carried away,\" Carrick affirmed after post-match. \"It's one game and it's really important we don't get carried away. It needs to be a regular feeling, that level of performance needs to be consistently what we're getting.",
      "\"It's a fantastic result and there is an element of soaking it up and enjoying it but it's definitely not enough and never enough. If you look at the result, we had three days to work on it and we've got to keep building on that.\"",

      "Harry Maguire could be back in the international picture after returning to the Manchester United line-up(Image: Michael Regan, Getty Images)",
      "Harry Maguire returned to the Manchester United starting line-up for last weekend's Manchester derby. The England international delivered an impressive performance, as did his teammates, helping new interim boss Michael Carrick guide the side to a commanding 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "It marked Maguire's first start since November following a thigh injury, though he had a brief return to action days earlier against Brighton in the FA Cup. He looked as though he'd never been absent, rattling the crossbar with a characteristic header and putting in a solid shift at the back.",
      "It may have been just a single match but the performance has led former England centre-half John Terry to advocate for Maguire's return to the international setup ahead of the World Cup. However, pundit and ex-Liverpool defender Phil Thompson doesn't agree, with England boss Thomas Tuchel set to decide later this year which players are worthy of a place on the plane to this summer's tournament.",
      "\"Man United is such a better team with Harry Maguire in the squad today, back playing,\" Terry said after the derby. \"I'm not sure there's a more difficult game to come into. A Manchester derby playing against the best striker in the world in [Erling] Haaland.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"He's just so good in both boxes and so good on the ball as well. Saw him drive out with the ball and was so comfortable with it. In this form, Harry Maguire has to be on the plane for the World Cup.\"",
      "Thompson responded to Terry's comments on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast. In doing so, he provided a reminder that different things are asked of a Manchester United centre-back compared to an England defender at a major tournament.",
      "\"I love Harry Maguire, he is always committed, he's a very, very good professional,\" Thompson said. \"But... Man City have most possession in a game, so what you do, you defend the edge of your own box. Harry loves that, he loves the challenge and he loves to defend.\"",
      "\"What does Harry not like doing? He doesn't like running back. He's got no pace, he knows that and understands that.That was playing to his strengths with Man City having the ball.\"",
      "Michael Carrick brought Maguire straight back in after a spell out injured(Image: Michael Regan, Getty Images)",
      "\"Playing for England, you've got to adapt a little bit but you have to push up. Particularly in the opening (group) games you're going to have most of the ball, you've got to play a high line, you do not want to get caught out. Harry's been a great servant for Manchester United and for England but I just can't see that.\"",
      "Maguire was involved in all of England's games at both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and also starred at Euro 2020. However, he was absent from Euro 2024 after dealing with injuries in the run-up to the tournament in Germany and has yet to be selected since Thomas Tuchel took the England job in January 2025.",
      "Carrick's decision to immediately recall him at club level was something of a risk, as the man in temporary charge acknowledged when speaking to BBC Match of the Day. \"We were going into the game, and he's literally trained two days out of 45 or so, so it was a big ask,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"He came on the other day for a short period of time (against Brighton in the FA Cup) but again hasn't really trained a whole lot so we've got to manage him. It shows again how much it means to the boys to play, and the boys were going down with all sorts. He got through it he managed him well. He was a big presence at the back for us. He showed that immense experience.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford reminded Hansi Flick of his quality after being left on the Barcelona bench for the second consecutive match. After netting as a substitute in Sunday's 2-1 La Liga loss at Real Sociedad, the Manchester United loanee was once again omitted from the starting line-up for Barcelona's vital Champions League fixture away to Slavia Prague.",
      "Raphinha was preferred ahead of him on the left flank but delivered a patchy display. Determined to make his mark, Rashford quickly influenced proceedings after coming on for Roony Bardghji in the 61st minute, delivering a cross from the left that Robert Lewandowski converted for Barca's decisive fourth goal in their 4-2 victory.",
      "It was the Polish striker's first Champions League goal of the campaign at the right end, extending his scoring run in the competition to 15 successive seasons. He had earlier put through his own net to level the score at 2-2 just before the interval.",
      "Crucially, the result left Barcelona in ninth place ahead of next week's final round of group fixtures, when they welcome Copenhagen. Victory could be sufficient to secure their passage to the last 16, avoiding the play-off round for sides finishing ninth to 24th.",
      "Remarkably, they are among eight teams level on 13 points, which includes Newcastle, Chelsea and Manchester City. Rashford will be hoping his contribution has earned him a place in Flick's starting line-up for both the Copenhagen encounter and, beforehand, Sunday's home meeting with Oviedo.",
      "He caught the eye of Spanish media with his appearance in Prague. Football Espana awarded him 6.5/10 and noted: \"Fantastic assist for Lewandowski's goal.\"",
      "Rashford celebrates with Robert Lewandowski after Barcelona's fourth goal against Slavia Prague(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The same publication was less impressed with Raphinha, stating: \"Another that was not at his best. Started on the left, before being switched to the right in the second half, but he was poor in both positions.\"",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's sacking, speculation has emerged that Rashford could resurrect his United career under the next permanent manager. However, converting his Barcelona loan into a permanent transfer remains the more probable scenario, with Flick yet to decide on the England international's future in Catalonia.",
      "Hansi Flick is weighing up Rashford's future(Image: Getty Images)",

      "Joleon Lescott and Shaun Wright-Phillips have reached a verdict concerning Kobbie Mainoo(Image: In The Mixer)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will secure a place in England's World Cup 2026 squad if he maintains his form under Michael Carrick at Manchester United. That's according to former Manchester City stars Joleon Lescott and Shaun Wright-Phillips.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, the young midfielder found first-team opportunities hard to come by at United. Despite impressing for both club and country, the Portuguese manager struggled to accommodate him in his starting XI. Mainoo sought a loan move last summer, with speculation about his departure persisting into January.",
      "However, following 14 months in charge, Amorim has been removed and Carrick is now in control until at least the season's conclusion. His opening match during this managerial spell concluded with an exciting 2-0 derby victory over rivals City, with Mainoo standing out as part of a three-man midfield.",
      "Before Amorim's dismissal, Mainoo's prospects of earning a spot in Thomas Tuchel's Three Lions squad for the forthcoming World Cup in North America appeared virtually non-existent. Yet, according to Wright-Phillips and Lescott, if he continues to feature regularly and perform well at United under Carrick he's guaranteed to make the final selection.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "When asked on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, whether Mainoo will make England's World Cup squad if he continues to perform, Lescott responded: \"100 per cent.\"",
      "Wright-Phillips agreed: \"If he keeps up with these performances, yeah.\" Lescott continued: \"You're not surprised by his performance. He's played like that before, hasn't he? I'm not surprised at all.\"",
      "Amorim benched the young midfielder(Image: Getty)",
      "The former City defender was also questioned about why Mainoo hadn't been getting game time under Amorim. Offering his theory, Lescott suggested: \"I think it was just a personal thing. Managers don't like certain players regardless of whether it's as a footballer or as a person.",
      "\"There's got to be something. There's got to be an element of that because he can't have not featured and then do that and it be a surprise.\"",
      "Wright-Phillips remarked: \"It just felt like to me that for whatever reason, the more people vouched for Kobbie, the more he refused. It's like he didn't wanna hear anybody.\"",
      "Mainoo is also well aware of what new boss Carrick thinks of him. The manager was questioned on Rio Ferdinand's podcast last year about whether he would construct United's squad around Mainoo, and his response was revealing.",
      "Carrick started Mainoo against City(Image: Getty)",
      "Carrick stated: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to. United's got to have an element of that.",
      "\"Always has done, always should, always have. To have a talent like that he's shown already, you've got to have players like that. You can say they get it. They know it, let's help them, let's build them and stick with them and I think there's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has taken over Manchester United training(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "When Michael Carrick sat down with Manchester United's owners last week, he outlined his vision for what would help make the team succeed again.",
      "This didn't involve stating the obvious of winning matches. More a blueprint for what methods he thought would give United the best chance of winning games. Joel and Avi Glazer, along with Sir Jim Ratcliffe were said to be engrossed in the words which spilled from Carrick's lips.",
      "The executive meeting had been planned to take place in Monaco. But Carrick couldn't justify travelling to the south of France, when he had important work to do on the training pitch. He told his bosses he would be adopting a different approach to training and match preparation. That he was invested in quality more than quantity. How talking to each other and being honest, however brutal this might be at times, was just as valuable as having the ball at their feet on the training ground.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Club sources insist Ratcliffe was impressed with the \"calm and intelligent demeanour\" of his new interim manager.",
      "Carrick knew there would be a step-up in enthusiasm and energy from his squad following his return to the club. That a new, if familiar face to some, would give the group a lift.",
      "But he spoke with assistant Steve Holland before the first training session, to discuss the importance of taking full advantage of an improved mood.",
      "While in the background, Harry Maguire made it clear to his team-mates how United had re-hired someone with the club's principles running through his blood.",
      "Carrick has given Holland free reign to plan sessions and take them at Carrington. Gareth Southgate handed him the same responsibility during his time as England manager. It worked for him - and Carrick sees no reason why the same cannot happen for himself.",
      "While Carrick remains in charge and has the final say on team decisions, he is humble enough to bow to Holland's far greater coaching experience. Sessions are shorter and more intense. The players have been impressed with the attention to detail.",
      "Assistant Head Coach Steve Holland of Manchester United in action in training(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "While Carrick has encouraged the squad not to be in such a rush to leave the training ground when it's time to go home. He wants relationships to build and flourish. And he wants to be there to see which ones work, and which ones don't.",
      "He has spelled out how being a United employee, let alone a highly paid player, should always be regarded as one of the ultimate privileges in football.",
      "Carrick has made a point of speaking to certain individuals whose futures seemed uncertain. Kobbie Mainoo, Patrick Dorgu and Joshua Zirkzee have all been told to focus on United and the immediate future.",
      "Ahead of home games, United will now arrive at Old Trafford later than they did when Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim were in charge. Carrick wants his squad to get the best greeting possible, and to engage with supporters after matches as well. He also wants his players to spend less time hanging around before kick offs.",
      "Amorim would send his players home after matches without much feedback. But Carrick, following his first game in charge which saw United thump Manchester City at Old Trafford, has taken the opposite attitude.",
      "Win, lose or draw, no-one leaves the home dressing room without feeling appreciated. Carrick has also attended youth games. He knows his actions lead by example. And being prepared to do what some of those to go before him didn't (although Amorim did), outlines how invested he is in the project.",
      "Michael Carrick applauding after Manchester United's derby win in January 2026(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Carrick's return has coincided with United being engulfed in a relentless debate about the value and nature of the criticism aimed at them by pundits, most notably former players.",
      "It has turned toxic, but Carrick has refused to get involved, making it clear to his players and coaching staff that there are far more pressing - and important - problems to fix. And with no European football to focus on, Carrick knows he has more time than usual to come up with solutions.",
      "But even if he manages to get a positive result at Arsenal this weekend, his mantra will remain the same. One swallow does not make a summer.",
      "A summer by which time, he will have left no stone unturned in his quest to become United manager on a permanent basis.",

The club may require more depth to be successful, but have a limited calendar in which to offer opportunities following their cup exits.",

      "Former Premier League stars Ruben Neves and Ruben Loftus-Cheek could be available in the coming days. A deal for either is unlikely to be quite as expensive.",
      "Real Madrid are not interested in signing Ruben Neves this month, according to reports in Spain, per Sport Witness. It is claimed that Los Blancos president Florentino Perez is not keen on signing new players in January.",
      "Portuguese outlet, Record, makes a similar claim and suggests that Perez is reluctant to spend millions on Neves this month. The ex-Wolves star's contract with Al Hilal expires in the summer.",
      "This could provide an open route for Manchester United to make their move. United are said to be willing to spend €20million (£17.4m)to sign him in January.",

      "Liverpool are thriving off the pitch(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Liverpool made financial history with their spot in the Deloitte Football Money League, while Manchester United dropped dramatically in the rankings. In the 29th edition of the Money League, the top 20 highest revenue generating football clubs for the 2024/25 season were revealed by the Deloitte Sports Business Group.",
      "The respective clubs made collective history after generating a record £10.4billion (€12bn) in revenue for the first time. The mammoth figure marks an 11% figure in all three main revenue streams of commercial revenue, matchday revenue and broadcast revenue, which increased from last season.",
      "The top four spots were dominated by several of Europe's footballing superpowers with Real Madrid retaining their spot, having earned close to £1bn (€1.2bn). The Spanish giants were followed closely by Barcelona who generated £849million (€975m) with Bayern Munich rounding out the top three with £750m (€861m) earned.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are the lone Ligue 1 club on the entire list and rank fourth with last year's revenue tipping the scales at £729m (€837m). Next up are the reigning Premier League champions as Liverpool became the highest revenue generating English club for the first time as they earned £728m (€836m), following their historic title-winning campaign last year.",
      "FOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The 2024/25 campaign proved to be a financially fruitful one for the Reds whose increased revenue was also bolstered by their return to the UEFA Champions League. The club also saw a 7% increase in commercial revenue thanks to additional non-matchday events at Anfield.",
      "Music struck big at the iconic stadium with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Dua Lipa and Lana Del Rey all performing at Anfield. Liverpool's financial success certainly wasn't matched by the Red Devils who suffered quite the dramatic drop from fourth to eighth in the Money League after a historically-bad campaign last season.",
      "United's revenue last year topped out at £691m (€793m) but their broadcast revenue fell from £224m (€258m) to £179m (€206m) after missing out on European football entirely while finishing 15th in the Premier League - the club's worst domestic campaign in 35 years.",
      "Liverpool's on-pitch success catapulted them in the Football Money League rankings(Image: PAUL ELLIS, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The list was dominated by English clubs with nine top-flight sides making the cut. Liverpool were followed by Manchester City who dropped four places to sixth with their revenue falling to £722m (€829m).",
      "Pep Guardiola's side suffered an unusually early Champions League exit as they were knocked out in the knockout phase play-offs, while finishing third domestically - their lowest position since the Spaniard's arrival a decade ago.",
      "Four Premier League clubs were ranked from seventh to 10th as Arsenal's earnings of £722m (€821m) left them closely behind. After United, it's Tottenham Hotspur who sit ninth as they generated £585m (€672m) despite a 17th-placed finish, but did end their 17-year trophy drought by winning the Europa League.",
      "Manchester United dropped from fourth to eighth in the Money League(Image: PA)",
      "Their city rivals Chelsea retained their position of 10th thanks to their return to the Champions League while also winning the Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup. The Blues' collection of silverware contributed to their 24/25 revenue of £509m (€584m).",
      "Aston Villa rose four places from last year and sit 14th in the rankings following their run to the Champions League quarter-finals in the 24/25 campaign with their earnings topping out at £392m (€450m).",
      "While Newcastle's Carabao Cup final victory last season isn't exactly filling their wallets, the Magpies still find a place in the Money League list, but did drop down two places from last year. The club's revenue sat at £346m (€398m).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Relegation contenders West Ham may be staring at the possibility of competing in the Championship later this year but the Hammers remain one of Europe's highest generating clubs. However, they stillt fell from last year's position of 17 to 20.",
      "West Ham's revenue of £242m (€278m) was affected by their 14th-placed finish in the league, as well as the absence of European football for the first time in four seasons.",

      "Bruno Fernandes' impact was on display for Manchester United against Manchester City(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Manchester United are keen to enter contract discussions with Bruno Fernandes ahead of the World Cup. Earlier this season, the Red Devils captain revealed he was on the brink of a move to Saudi Arabian team Al-Hilal last summer.",
      "Although the transfer didn't materialise, United will be preparing for further interest in the former Sporting Lisbon star. Fernandes, 31, has expressed his desire to make decisions about his future once the World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico concludes.",
      "However, it seems United are eager to understand his intentions before the tournament kicks off in the summer, despite his previous comments. ESPN reports club officials are planning a pre-World Cup meeting with Fernandes to clarify his decision.",
      "His current contract with the club runs until the summer of 2027 and United have the option to extend his contract for an additional year, keeping him at Old Trafford until 2028. However, it's suggested they are content to let him decide his next steps.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Nevertheless, it's believed United would prefer him to stay at the club for at least another season. Against Manchester City, he demonstrated exactly why United do not want to let go of him.",
      "Michael Carrick's second stint as interim manager got off to a flying start with a resounding 2-0 victory over City in the Manchester Derby. Fernandes played a pivotal role in the win over Pep Guardiola's side, setting up Bryan Mbeumo's goal.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was pivotal against Manchester City(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "The board are keen for Fernandes to stay at Old Trafford to aid the transition to a new manager. Carrick has made a promising start, but it's unlikely he'll be given the role permanently.",
      "In December, Fernandes surprised club officials by telling journalists he believed United were ready to cash in on him. The midfielder suggested the club wanted to sell him, but didn't because then-manager Ruben Amorim wanted to keep him.",
      "Speaking to Portuguese TV station Canal 11, Fernandes said: \"The club wanted me to go [away]. I told the directors that, I don't think they had the courage to make that decision because the coach wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even though the coach wanted me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "Fernandes provided the perfect pass for Mbeumo to score the opening goal against City(Image: DARREN STAPLES, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "He added: \"I was valued, what values me most has to be my club, although I feel, lately, that I'm a little on the tightrope. In England a player reaches 30 and they think he has to remodel.",
      "\"The issue of loyalty is not as well-regarded as it used to be. I could have left in this market, I was going to earn a lot more money, a season ago I was going to leave, I was going to win many trophies this season.\"",

      "Rashford moved to the Catalan side in the summer and has since notched eight goals and 11 assists across 29 outings. The 28-year-old has shone at Barca despite a wealth of attacking options, including Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, with the club eager to retain his services.",
      "The La Liga leaders possess a £26.1million option they can trigger to secure the player's permanent signature at the season's end. Rashford, who found the net from the substitutes' bench at the weekend, is also reportedly enthusiastic about remaining at Camp Nou.",
      "Barca continue to be pleased with Rashford's impact this campaign but are understood to harbour some reservations regarding his defensive work. The England star is not considered as effective at pressing as Raphinha, though his commitment and attitude are valued, according to The Athletic.",
      "This could still prove a consideration that gives Barcelona cause for reflection. The Spanish table-toppers have not been financially comfortable in recent campaigns, which might yet create hesitation come summer.",
      "Barca may explore alternative arrangements beyond activating the clause to strike a deal with United. The combination of the transfer fee and Rashford's wages could prove challenging for the club to accommodate.",
      "The report suggests that Barcelona could even U-turn on their plan to activate their purchase clause for Rashford - and consider signing him on loan for a second season instead. Rashford's contract with United runs until 2028.",

Both of them should have been offloaded a long time ago, but they are still here collecting their paychecks.",
      "\"The fact that they are still here is a joke. Are they the worst players in the team? No, but they have been here for so long, taking up space in the squad and performing below what you expect from a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Has it been impossible to get rid of them? It is definitely a possibility that they just like being part of Manchester United and earning a lot of money, but that tells me a lot about their ambitions. If they had real ambition, they would move on to a club where they could make a difference. They can play at Manchester United, but they can’t make a difference.",

      "\"Listen, it is hard sometimes, I know that. I was told I didn't have a future at Manchester United, but Gary Neville did. That's life, and you just have to move on.",
      "\"I think when they are done playing football one day, they will realise that they made a mistake by staying for so long. Can I blame them? Yes and no. They were offered a contract and they took it, which is completely fair, but at some point you have to look yourself in the mirror and accept that you have nothing to offer.",
      "\"Can they do a good job under Carrick? Maybe, if he changes the playing style drastically, and he might have to if he wants to keep his job. But the way Manchester United should be going forward, being attack-minded, just doesn't suit them.\"",

That series would have mirrored those already produced by clubs including Arsenal, Manchester City, Tottenham and Sunderland.",
      "United, though, withdrew from discussions following their Europa League final defeat back in May, with then-head coach Ruben Amorim's concerns about possible interference cited as one of the factors.

      "Manchester United will be looking to have another say in the Premier League title race when they visit leaders Arsenal on Sunday. Red Devils fans are still basking in the glory of Saturday's derby victory, which dealt a major blow to Manchester City's title hopes.",
      "It was a dream start for new interim boss Michael Carrick, who has been handed the reins until the end of the season following the sacking of Ruben Amorim. Carrick is not expected to oversee many, if any, transfers this month as he insists the group is good enough to finish in the Champions League places.",
      "However, work is going on behind the scenes regarding summer transfers, both signings and departures, given the need to freshen up the squad ahead of next season. Here's a round of the latest transfer news and views…",
      "United may have to move quickly after being credited with an interest in Barcelona and Spain midfielder Marc Casado.",
      "The 22-year-old is said to be frustrated at his lack of game time under Barca boss Hansi Flick and could be on the move as early as this month, with Atletico Madrid leading the chase as they look to find a replacement for Conor Gallagher following his departure to Tottenham.",
      "The Red Devils, along with Wolves, are also keen on Casado, reports Mundo Deportivo. Premier League clubs could have an advantage, as it is believed Casado would rather move abroad if he leaves Barcelona.",
      "However, that could hinge on whether those clubs are willing to move this month rather than wait until summer, by which time United's managerial situation will be clearer.",
      "Marc Casado is interested in playing abroad after struggling for game time at Barcelona(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "United have been urged to offload Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as they are symbols of the club's recent failings. That's according to former Old Trafford defender Paul Parker, who has launched a scathing attack on the long-serving defenders.",
      "Parker, who played for United in the first half of the 1990s, says Maguire and Shaw, who cost the club a combined £110million, believes they should be let go as soon as possible. The former England defender told MyBettingSites.co.uk: \"I think Maguire and Shaw are a symbol of what has gone wrong at Man United.",
      "\"I can't get my head around people thinking they are the solution. Both of them should have been offloaded a long time ago, but they are still here collecting their paychecks.",
      "Maguire has been told it's time to leave United(Image: Richard Sellers/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "\"The fact that they are still here is a joke. Are they the worst players in the team? No, but they have been here for so long, taking up space in the squad and performing below what you expect from a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Has it been impossible to get rid of them? It is definitely a possibility that they just like being part of Manchester United and earning a lot of money, but that tells me a lot about their ambitions.",
      "\"If they had real ambition, they would move on to a club where they could make a difference. They can play at Manchester United, but they can't make a difference.\"",
      "Luke Shaw has been at United more than a decade(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "Maguire, whose contract expires this summer, has reportedly been the subject of interest from Inter Milan this month. For now, he appears to be in Carrick's plans, having played in the win over City, but Parker added: \"None of them are getting better. At their age, they have to realise that it is time to move on.",
      "\"Can they do a good job under Carrick? Maybe, if he changes the playing style drastically, and he might have to if he wants to keep his job. But the way Manchester United should be going forward, being attack-minded, just doesn't suit them.",

      "Arsenal look the team to beat in both the Premier League and Champions League this season - but how good are they? Theo Walcott caused a stir on Tuesday by asking how Mikel Arteta's men would fare against the legendary Manchester United side of 2008.",
      "\"We'd batter them,\" was Wayne Rooney's confident reply. United hero Rooney was one of many stars of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad that won both the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "At the time, the Red Devils become the first club to win both the Premier League and Champions League - in their modern formats - in the same season. After Manchester City's treble triumph in 2023, Arsenal are aiming to become the third.",
      "Wayne Rooney is spot on. For starters, the Manchester United team of 2008 were the best in Europe, having won the Champions League in Moscow.",
      "This current Arsenal side is good, but hasn't won a single trophy yet, let alone the biggest one of the lot. Secondly, that United side not only had Rooney in his prime, but also Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo alongside him.",
      "Arsenal pride themselves on a strong defence, but it's difficult to see the current one Mikel Arteta has from being able to stop those three coming at them.",
      "It's always difficult comparing teams from different eras. But the one United had back then is one of the great sides, one which would succeed in any era.",
      "And while Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice are fine midfielders, they are not in the same league as Paul Scholes. The United team for the 2008 Champions League final couldn't even find a starting place for Ryan Giggs. That's how good it was.",
      "The Manchester United squad of 2006/07 and 2007/08 won the Premier League in both seasons and the Champions League in the second of those two campaigns.",
      "Of course Wayne Rooney’s vintage United would beat this current Arsenal team, which is a developing force rather than an established powerhouse, as Sir Alex Ferguson's men were in that era.",
      "Rooney’s United were established winners, Arsenal have won one FA Cup in the past eight full seasons. United’s points per game ratio in 2006/07 and 2007/08 is better than Arsenal’s current 2.27 per game.",
      "In the 2007/08 Premier League season, United averaged 2.18 goals per game, Arsenal are currently scoring at a rate of 1.82 per game.",
      "Arsenal’s defensive excellence has been key to their superiority this season but, in the Premier League, they are still conceding at a higher rate to what United conceded at in 2007/08.",
      "Arsenal are letting in an average of 0.64 goals per match, the Premier League champions of 2007/08 let in an average of 0.58 goals per match.",
      "The current goal difference graph has Arsenal finishing with a figure of 45, United of 2007/08 finished with a goal difference of 58.",
      "United’s back line - based on the partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic - would have coped well with what Arsenal have to offer going forward while Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo would have given the much-vaunted Gunners defence a lot more trouble than what presents itself week in, week out in this largely underwhelming 2025/26 season.",
      "It would be a decent battle in midfield but, in the end, United would come out on top. Batter? Maybe not. Beat? Certainly.",
      "United were able to trot out a decent front three(Image: DAILY RECORD)",
      "These debates are always extremely hard to get right. In the 18 years since United won their third Champions League, football has changed dramatically. It could be argued that the current Arsenal team would be significantly fitter and also have the ability to use possession in a way which English teams struggle to do at that point.",
      "I would have no arguments if people either sit either side of the fence in the Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic or Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba debate. They are both truly elite. Declan Rice, Martin Zubimendi and Mikel Merino aren't a bad midfield three either and have some very different qualities to the players under Alex Ferguson.",
      "But where there is simply no argument, is in forward areas. United trotted out a barely believable trio of Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and…Cristiano Ronaldo. If Arteta had any one of those players, they would be 15 points clear and near-certainties to win the Champions League. And that is where this debate ends.",
      "Call me a slave to nostalgia, but I'm taking that United side everyday of the week.",
      "A useful starting point in these sorts of debates is the trophy cabinet. A quick glance reveals that Manchester United won the Premier League, League Cup and the Club World Cup in the 2008/09 season, while finishing as runners-up in the Champions League and semi-finalists in the FA Cup. While Arsenal are still in all four competitions this season, they are yet to have their name inscribed on any silverware, so sweeping assessments are premature.",
      "United's squad contained some all-time great players: Edwin van der Sar, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. Arsenal's contains some exceptional stars of the present: Gabriel Magalhaes, Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka.",
      "The only way I can see Arsenal's current vintage coming out on top is if they end the 2025/26 season with multiple trophies. Right now, though, they still have some way to go until they can considered the equals of those who have actually been there and done it.",
      "Arsenal's strength in depth has been to clear for all to see this season(Image: Photo by David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)",
      "First and foremost, these questions are already tedious. 'Maradona or Messi?' 'Van Dijk or Vidic?' You'll never find an answering comparing different eras, but let's try.",
      "United had the firepower to beat anyone in the world that season - and the two campaigns either side. In a one-off fixture, they'd likely batter Arsenal as Rooney says.",
      "Over the course of a season, however, Arsenal would stand a better chance of winning the Premier League. Their squad depth is borderline obscene and with William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes, they're a match for Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.",
      "Overall, though, I'd pick United. We've got the evidence with them, whereas it won't be until May when we find out how good Arsenal really are.",

The midfielder, who was handed an England recall by Thomas Tuchel last September, moved to AC Milan in the summer of 2023.",

The Champions League future of the Serie A team is in jeopardy after they were held to a draw by the Danish champions, who were down to 10 men after Thomas Delaney was sent off on the 35-minute mark.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder McTominay quickly put the visitors in the lead with his fourth goal in five matches, but Copenhagen rescued a point thanks to a Jordan Larsson goal with 18 minutes left.",
      "The result was a missed opportunity for Napoli, with much of the team, including United loanees Rasmus Hojlund, facing criticism from the Italian media. However, McTominay was largely seen as the standout player of the match, with both Il Messaggero and Gazzetta awarding him a top-of-the-class 7/10.",

      "Speaking to Sky Sport Italia, he expressed his frustration, saying: \"We should have won that game, it's unacceptable. We should have scored the second and third goals to close out the game, even if it was a difficult surface. It's really disappointing that we didn't.",

      "However, United haven't opted to add just yet, though there is still 10 days for the Reds to change that. Despite their inactivity in the transfer window, Michael Carrick's side continue to be linked with signing several players, with a central midfielder thought to be at the top of their shortlist.",
      "Noah Sadiki and Wilfred Ndidi are the latest two midfielders tipped to move to Old Trafford, while United remain interested in Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Ruben Neves.",
      "Elsewhere, United could be active on the outgoing front too, with forward Joshua Zirkzee linked with a move to Roma and Juventus after failing to make the matchday squad against Manchester City on Saturday.",
      "Stay up-to-date with the latest Manchester United transfer news below...",
      "Sheffield Wednesday spoke highly of United in the summer after they agreed to waive a fee to allow Harry Amass to join the Championship club on loan. This was due to the Owls' poor financial position under previous owner Dejphon Chansiri.",
      "Wednesday had hoped they could extend Amass' stay until the end of the campaign and their manager Henrik Pedersen was confident a deal could be done before last week's fixtures.",
      "However, the full-back is set to join Norwich City on loan for the remainder of the campaign which will be a blow for Wednesday. For United, the move to the Canaries makes more sense, particularly as Norwich will be involved in more competitive fixtures than the Owls between now and the end of the campaign.",
      "Still, it is unlikely this will go down well with them.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Aston Villa have expressed interest in Ruben Loftus-Cheek just days after he was reportedly 'offered' to United. The ex-Chelsea academy graduate has slipped down the hierarchy at AC Milan and could be loaned out as he aims to secure a place in the World Cup squad.",
      "Villa are seeking reinforcements following an injury to Boubacar Kamara, who is expected to miss the remainder of the season. According to The Athletic, Unai Emery's team could look to secure a midfielder on loan, with Loftus-Cheek among the candidates being considered.",
      "The Midlands club have already been unsuccessful in their pursuit of Conor Gallagher this month, with Tottenham presenting a permanent offer to Atletico Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was previously reported to have been proposed to United, and 'exploratory' discussions are said to have occurred.",
      "Manchester United is considered as a 'potential destination' for Borussia Dortmund forward Felix Nmecha, according to Sport Bild. The 25-year-old hasn't kicked on as much as he would have hoped at Dortmund and has scored just five goals in 28 appearances this season.",
      "Despite this, Dortmund have no interest in letting the player leave the club before the end of the transfer window. Nmecha has two-and-a-half years left on his contract at the Bundesliga club.",
      "As things stand, United are sticking to their guns when it comes to bringing in players before the February 2 deadline.",
      "It was the case before Amorim was sacked and it is the case now Carrick is in interim charge, that there is a reluctance to sign players in January as the long-term plan is to invest in the summer.",
      "However, United were willing to go back on that stance had they won the race for Semenyo. The money was there for the Ghana international but in the end he chose City.",
      "Since then the money has been locked away but should a long-term target become available for the right price, United could open their cheque book again.",
      "Manchester United influential fan group The 1958 are planning their biggest-ever protest against the club's owners - and the first one directed at Sir Jim Ratcliffe - for the Premier League game against Fulham on Sunday, February 1.",
      "The group have urged supporters to gather at two meeting points ahead of the game at Old Trafford, with organising expecting well over the 6,000 that attended the peaceful protest against Arsenal last May.",
      "\"Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and, in our opinion, is helping to keep them in charge. Twenty-one years of a debt mountain, mismanagement and financial greed is 21 years too long. Enough is enough,\" a The 1958 spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "\"So we protest not just against the Glazers, but now also against INEOS and Ratcliffe, a man once seen by many, including ourselves, as a possible saviour, a beacon of hope, but now revealed as complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is.",
      "\"This is no longer just about ownership; this is about survival. The survival of our identity, the survival of our fan culture, our supporter community, and our values.\"",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Manchester United are exploring the loan market for a new midfielder and Wilfred Ndidi is thought to be under consideration. The former Leicester man has made 16 appearances since making the move to Besiktas last summer.",
      "The 29-year-old had been touted as a free agent target for United at the end of last season, but he instead moved abroad after his contract expired at Leicester and opted to sign for Besiktas instead.",
      "But now, United are still tracking Ndidi's progress and could move into the loan market for the one-time FA Cup winner, who has two-and-a-half years left on his current deal.",
      "Sunderland are not open to a possible swap deal involving Manuel Ugarte and Noah Sadiki this month, according to The Mirror.",
      "Reports had suggested that United were keen on signing talented midfielder Sadiki from the Black Cats and sending Ugarte, who has struggled for regular game time this season, the other way.",
      "But Sunderland are not keen on the prospect of signing Ugarte and selling Sadiki, who has made 16 appearances in the Premier League this season after signing from Union Saint-Gilloise last summer.",
      "Real Madrid are not interested in signing Ruben Neves this month, according to reports in Spain, per Sport Witness. It is claimed that Los Blancos president Florentino Perez is not keen on signing new players in January.",
      "Portuguese publication Record makes a similar assertion, indicating that Perez is hesitant to invest millions in Neves this month. The former Wolves midfielder's deal with Al Hilal runs out in the summer.",
      "This could create a clear pathway for Manchester United to make their approach. United are reportedly prepared to pay €20million (£17.4m) to secure his signature in January.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer is set to join Hull City on loan until the end of the season, according to talkSPORT.",
      "There is an agreement in place between the two clubs and the transfer is expected to be completed in the next 24 hours.",
      "Collyer, 22, spent the first half of the season on loan at West Brom but struggled, making 12 Championship appearances.",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Amass is set to undergo a medical on Thursday before putting the finishing touches on his loan move to Norwich City, according to reports.",
      "The 18-year-old, who spent the first half of the season at Sheffield Wednesday, is Norfolk-bound and is expected to put pen-to-paper on a deal until the end of the season.",

      "Jose Mourinho had Michael Carrick in his backroom team for the latter stages of his spell as Manchester United head coach(Image: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United head coach and current Benfica manager Jose Mourinho has called out the 'most important teams' for hiring inexperienced coaches. Mourinho was in charge of the Reds for just under two and a half years and arrived with a stellar CV thanks to his success with Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter.",
      "Mourinho delivered the Europa League, League Cup and Community Shield in the 2016/17 season. He also guided United to a second place finish and has since described his achievements at Old Trafford as the greatest of his career. Following the Reds, Mourinho has struggled though.",
      "His stint at Tottenham ended without a trophy but he did manage to win the Conference League with AS Roma. However, his time at Fenerbahce was mostly unsuccessful and while Benfica are currently unbeaten in Liga Portugal this season, they are ten points behind runaway leaders Porto. It has not been smooth sailing at United either.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The Reds have not won a European trophy since Mourinho left and have struggled in the Premier League. This season has seen Ruben Amorim sacked and replaced temporarily by Michael Carrick until the end of the season. Carrick and Mourinho know each other well.",
      "Mourinho was his manager for most of his time at the club and the ex-midfielder made 43 appearances for the 62-year-old. Upon retiring, Carrick transitioned into an assistant head coach role under Mourinho for a short period before the Portuguese manager left Old Trafford. The current United interim head coach went on to become Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's assistant.",
      "He would take charge for three matches in 2021 before leaving and spending time as head coach at Middlesbrough in the Championship. Carrick returned last week to become interim for the second time until the end of the season.",
      "Following Benfica's 2-0 defeat to Juventus in the Champions League, Mourinho chose to make a subtle dig at United and another of his former clubs, Chelsea, for hiring inexperienced managers. He said, as quoted by Leggo: \"For me, it is a surprise when coaches with no history and no work done have the opportunity to coach the most important teams in the world; this is the real surprise.",
      "\"When Milan takes [Max] Allegri, when Juventus takes [Luciano] Spalletti or when Roma chooses [Gian Piero] Gasperini, these are never surprises.\" Carrick will remain in charge of United until the end of the season when a permanent appointment will be made.",
      "Depending how well Carrick does between now and the end of the season will define whether or not he is considered for the permanent position at the end of the season. Oliver Glasner, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Tuchel and Xavi are among the names also linked with United.",

      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed an excellent first week as Manchester United head coach(Image: )",
      "It's been a good week to have shares in Michael Carrick. The 44-year-old showed off his coaching credentials by steering Manchester United to their best performance of the season on the back of just three training sessions, and then watched on as some of his rivals for the job suffered more dispiriting weeks.",
      "Carrick will never be bold or brash enough to offer such sentiments in public and he isn't one to get carried away, rightly so on the back of one victory, but there is no doubt this week has enhanced his reputation.",
      "That 2-0 victory against Manchester City at Old Trafford was an extremely impressive performance, though it has been put into context further by City's defeat in Norway on Tuesday night, with Pep Guardiola's side suddenly looking out of sorts.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But United's dominance and their front-foot, attacking football reflected well on Carrick and the coaching staff he put together at short notice. Likewise, the changes he has made to training plans at Carrington and around matchdays have gone down well with players.",
      "All those who spoke publicly after Saturday's win praised the impact the former United midfielder had in a short period of time, and he clearly has the squad's support after a draining period under Ruben Amorim. It's early days, but Carrick has put himself in the conversation to see his contract extended beyond the end of this season.",
      "United insist the process to appoint a head coach beyond the end of this season will be \"thorough\", and for all that Carrick has done himself no harm this week, there won't be a rush to judge inside Old Trafford. It is still early days.",
      "There will be no desire to rule anybody out already, either, but for two potential candidates who both have their supporters at United, it has been a much more difficult week.",
      "Oliver Glasner let rip at his Crystal Palace bosses at the weekend and is now facing up to another difficult inquisition later this week, with Jean-Philippe Mateta keen to join the Selhurst Park exodus. Even if Glasner limps on until the end of the season, it looks like it will be a difficult few months. Palace are already 10 games without a win, and although the Austrian is losing his best players, this is now a huge test of his skills as a man manager and a unifying force.",
      "You can be sure people at United will be watching closely. Glasner's coaching credentials aren't really in doubt and his work at mid-ranking teams such as Eintracht Frankfurt and Palace has probably earned him a shot at the elite, but the challenges he will face for the rest of this season will be a test of character.",
      "Another combustible head coach who suffered a tough week was Roberto De Zerbi. His Marseille side hosted Liverpool in the Champions League and what should have been an opportunity to remind Premier League audiences of his abilities as a coach turned into a difficult evening, with the visitors running out emphatic winners.",
      "De Zerbi was asked about links to the United job after the game and again sought to play them down, insisting he was happy at Marseille and didn't know what would happen in the future. His time might come again, but Wednesday night was a chance to put his name back in lights, and it is one that slipped by.",
      "Carrick had no such trouble back in Manchester.",

      "Manchester United could fall out of the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League next season, after plummeting to eighth in the latest report, their lowest-ever position in its 29-year history.",
      "The report takes into account United's miserable 2024/25 season, when they finished 14th in the Premier League and suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final. A total revenue of €793million for the season puts them below domestic rivals Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Although there was an increase in matchday and commercial revenues, there was a substantial year-on-year fall in broadcast revenues and the trend is set to continue into next season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United will play just 20 matches at Old Trafford this season and have no European football at all, leading to fears their place in the top 10 in the established Deloitte report could be at risk.",
      "\"I think it’s reflective of the tough times that the club’s going through and there's a genuine fear that they could fall out of the top 10 next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe describes them as the world's leading football brand, but if the world's leading football brand is outside of the top 10 of revenue generators, then that's not very promising.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim steered United to the final of that competition in Bilbao, but even that didn't make up much of the shortfall to being outside of the Champions League at a time when a seat at Europe's top table is more financially rewarding than ever.",
      "\"With this new Swiss model, the Champions League is worth an absolute fortune,\" he said. \"And being in the second competition, you're probably getting around about a quarter of the money that you'd get.",
      "\"Even United getting to the final, they would have earned less money than the likes of City would have generated from being knocked out by Real Madrid in the play-off round.\"",
      "The value of Champions League football shows how important it is for United to secure a return to that competition this season after two successive years away.",
      "Last weekend's win against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge has put them back in fifth, which should be good enough to qualify, although the league table remains congested.",
      "If Carrick can steer United back to the Champions League and they enjoy a good season next year, then it should put them back on track financially as well.",
      "\"One successful season can do it,\" explained Maguire. \"Every match at Old Trafford in the Champions League is worth £8million or £9million in terms of ticket sales, so you've got a minimum of four matches.",
      "\"You get to the quarter-finals, you're probably looking at six or seven, so that's £60million. They'll pick up £70million or £80million in prize money as a minimum if you get that far. That’s £150million, then you get the extra £10million from Adidas and other sponsors will be kicking in as well, so that’s the thick end of an extra £200million and they bounce back to where you would expect them to be.",
      "\"Paradoxically, Manchester United fans, from a financial point of view, should want City and Liverpool to do well in the Champions League because that will cement that fifth place, which could be the difference as far as next season is concerned.\"",

      "Amass spent the first half of the campaign on loan with Sheffield Wednesday. The loan was announced as a season-long deal, but the structure of the transfer due to Wednesday's financial woes meant it expired on January 5, which saw Amass return to Manchester at the beginning of the month.",
      "He is now to spend the second half of the campaign on loan with Norwich. Wednesday wanted to re-sign Amass on loan - he made 21 league starts at the Hillsborough Stadium - but the Canaries have won the race for his signature.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The 18-year-old won back-to-back Wednesday player of the month awards in November and December, and he was not short of interest from other Championship clubs. United had covered the costs of Amass' loan to facilitate game time, which opened the door for Norwich to make an improved offer to sign him.",

      "Carrick made the trip to Leigh Sports Village.(Image: )",
      "Ruben Amorim insisted on doing everything his way at Manchester United, which meant he ignored some easy wins, like making the effort to attend an academy game to show support for the club's young players. Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Michael Carrick was appointed as interim last week and attended an Under-21 match just seven days later, sitting alongside Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion. Jason Wilcox, director of football, and head of the academy, Stephen Torpey, were present, while Darren Fletcher also attended after returning to his role as Under-18 following a brief stint as caretaker.",
      "It might not seem important that Carrick and his backroom staff made the effort to attend, but the truth is their presence is a symbol of support for the youth system and highlights that there is a pathway. Carrick planned to speak to the Under-21s after their game against Sporting Lisbon, another classy touch from United's interim head coach. Some academy players were disillusioned with Amorim's comments in the media, but Carrick has sought to provide encouragement in his first week in the job.",
      "Fletcher spoke passionately as he defended the academy in a recent press conference, and Carrick is expected to pick up that baton, despite only having assurances of the job until the end of the season for now. Carrick made 464 United appearances and understands the club's finest teams across the decades have included academy players. Followers of the academy argued that understanding was not there with Amorim.",
      "Carrick made an effort to attend the game.(Image: )",
      "Amorim overstepped the mark when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship, pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game and namedropped Toby Collyer unprompted. The level-headed Carrick is guaranteed not to make such headlines.",
      "And Carrick was treated to a thoroughly entertaining first half at Leigh Sports Village, which saw James Scanlon score twice to give United a 2-1 advantage against Sporting. Woodgate was spotted pointing at the team sheet at the interval and might well have been saying 'the goalscorer looks like a good player'.",
      "Scanlon has already made a handful of senior international appearances for Gibraltar, who he qualifies to represent through his mother, and he has clearly outgrown academy football, which was further illustrated by him completing his hat-trick in the second half with a clinical finish in the box. Torpey is looking after loans after Evans' decision to step down from his role as head of loans and pathways, and he should arrange a move away for Scanlon before the end of the January transfer window.",
      "Tyler Fredricson wore the captain's armband against Sporting, a few days after sitting alongside Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt to watch the Manchester derby in the directors' box. From the players who started against Sporting, Fredricson is another obvious candidate for a loan in the second half of the campaign. The youngster has been given just two first-team minutes since being hooked against Grimsby Town in August and would benefit from playing in a competitive environment.",
      "Scanlon scored a hat-trick against Sporting.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick got a first glimpse of the Fletcher brothers in action. Jack Fletcher played from the bench in successive Premier League games against Aston Villa, Newcastle and Wolves in December, and he would have seen Sporting as an audition for further opportunities now Carrick has taken charge of the team.",
      "Tyler Fletcher has made three matchday squads in the Premier League without getting a chance to make his debut. He will look at what his twin brother has achieved and be motivated to do the same.",
      "It will be interesting to see how much Carrick uses academy prospects, given he has a practically full-strength squad at his disposal and just 16 games remaining in the topflight this season.",
      "Only the best young players from the academy will be able to earn minutes and Shea Lacey is the favourite to stay around Carrick's senior squad. He was not involved against Sporting after training with the first-team at Carrington, and he currently has the wind behind his sails after two bright cameos.",
      "United ultimately claimed a 3-2 victory against Sporting, but they will only learn whether they progress to the knockout rounds of the Premier League International Cup when the remaining group games are played. Carrick was at least treated to a five-goal thriller and a hat-trick from the talented Scanlon at Leigh.",

That is the verdict of former United forward Giuseppe Rossi, who has backed Keane to replace Michael Carrick and become the new boss at Old Trafford.",
      "United are still looking for a permanent successor for Ruben Amorim despite appointing Carrick as interim head coach until the end of the season. Carrick made an instant impression in his first game back in charge, leading the Reds to a 2-0 win against arch rivals Manchester City on Saturday.",

      "Ex-Italy international Rossi, however, believes that Keane should be a strong contender to become United's next manager. Keane is as high as 80/1 with some bookmakers to take over at the Reds, but Rossi has tipped him to be the best fit due to his strong character and leadership.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",

      "Former Manchester United forward Giuseppe Rossi has explained why he thinks Keane should take over(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"It's a shame that Roy Keane can't just bury the hatchet with Sir Alex, but listen, they have their reasons, and truthfully, I'll just leave it up to him and to whoever is involved.",
      "\"I always like to talk the football side of things, and personality-wise, I see Roy as a manager who might be one of the only guys who could do what Sir Alex did at United.\"",
      "Keane made 480 appearances during a successful, trophy-laden spell at United, scoring 51 goals and winning 17 trophies, including the Premier League seven times and the FA Cup on four occasions.",
      "The ex-Republic of Ireland midfielder retired from football in June 2006 and made the jump straight into management, taking over at Championship side Sunderland. He did a terrific job at the Stadium of Light, guiding the Black Cats to promotion back to the Premier League in his first season.",
      "He then kept Sunderland in the top flight in the following campaign and spearheaded them to a famous 2-1 home win against arch rivals Newcastle United. But Keane ended up standing down from his role at the Black Cats in December 2008 after a difficult start to his third season in charge.",
      "Michael Carrick is currently in charge on an interim basis and is an option to take the job full-time(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "After spending a couple of months out, Keane returned to take over at Ipswich Town in April 2009. Once again, Keane solidified the Tractor Boys in the Championship but was axed in January 2011. His record at Portman Road stood at 28 wins, 25 draws and 28 losses from his 81 matches.",
      "While Keane has done some coaching as an assistant to Martin O'Neill in the Ireland national team and at Nottingham Forest, as well as working under Paul Lambert at Aston Villa, it has been 15 years since he last had the top job.",
      "\"He hasn’t managed in a while, but I feel like he has that same fire in him, and he loves Manchester United,\" Rossi added. \"I think we can all tell he’s saying things from a place of passion. He always wants the best for the club.",
      "\"If that day ever comes, that Roy Keane returns to United, you’re going to see him show more similarities to Sir Alex Ferguson rather than differences.",
      "\"He’s doing great with his media career and you know what, why not take advantage of it? God bless him for doing that. He’s done so tremendously well with his playing career, he deserves to do whatever he wants, whatever makes him happy. But I would love to see him at Manchester United.\"",

      "Harry Maguire's Manchester derby recall caught the eye(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United captain Harry Maguire was welcomed back into the starting XI by Michael Carrick for last weekend's derby. The England international impressed, as did all of his team-mates, as Carrick inspired the team to an impressive 2-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "It was the 32-year-old's first start since November after a thigh injury kept him out of action for the final few weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure. He looked like he'd never been away, smashing a trademark header against the crossbar and putting in the hard yards defensively.",
      "While it might have just been one game, the display has prompted former England centre-back John Terry to back Maguire for an international recall. However, pundit and former Liverpool defender Phil Thompson has a different view.",
      "\"Man United is such a better team with Harry Maguire in the squad today, back playing,\" Terry said after the derby. \"I’m not sure there’s a more difficult game to come into. A Manchester derby playing against the best striker in the world in [Erling] Haaland.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"He’s just so good in both boxes and so good on the ball as well. Saw him drive out with the ball and was so comfortable with it. In this form, Harry Maguire has to be on the plane for the World Cup.\"",
      "Terry's comments were raised on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, where Thompson was a guest. However, the former Soccer Saturday regular was less convinced.",
      "\"I love Harry Maguire, he is always committed, he's a very, very good professional,\" Thompson said. \"But... Man City have most possession in a game, so what you do, you defend the edge of your own box. Harry loves that, he loves the challenge and he loves to defend.",
      "\"What does Harry not like doing? He doesn't like running back. He's got no pace, he knows that and understands that. That was playing to his strengths with Man City having the ball.",
      "Phil Thompson isn't convinced Harry Maguire should get an England recall(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"Playing for England, you've got to adapt a little bit but you have to push up. Particularly in the opening games you're going to have most of the ball, you've got to play a high line, you do not want to get caught out. Harry's been a great servant for Manchester United and for England but I just can't see that.\"",
      "Maguire has won 64 senior caps for England, playing in every single match at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. He missed Euro 2024 after failing to fully recover from injury in time for the tournament, though, and hasn't featured at all under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "An instant recall at club level was a calculated gamble for Carrick, though, with the interim boss reflecting on the situation when he spoke to BBC Match of the Day. \"We were going into the game, and he's literally trained two days out of 45 or so, so it was a big ask,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"He came on the other day for a short period of time (against Brighton in the FA Cup) but again hasn't really trained a whole lot so we've got to manage him. It shows again how much it means to the boys to play, and the boys were going down with all sorts. He got through it he managed him well. He was a big presence at the back for us. he showed that immense experience.\"",

      "Marseille head coach Roberto De Zerbi has insisted he is unsure what the future holds for him when he was quizzed about a return to the Premier League, amid links to the Manchester United job. United appointed Michael Carrick as the interim head coach until the end of the season last week.",
      "Carrick has seen his popularity increase having led United to a stunning 2-0 victory over Manchester City in the derby. However, Ineos are still hunting for a permanent replacement for Ruben Amorim, who was sacked following the 1-1 draw with Leeds at the beginning of the month.",
      "De Zerbi is one of the names being linked to Old Trafford, having impressed at Brighton prior to his move to Marseille. The Seagulls' approach is one which has impressed Ineos previously and resulted in Sir Jim Ratcliffe hiring Dan Ashworth - albeit that appointment proved ill-fated.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I am very happy to stay here. I am working with passion and for the future, I don’t know.\" De Zerbi is just one of a few names to be mentioned among the candidates for the United job.",
      "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has been brought up recently, as has Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner. It is understood the Austrian would be interested in the vacancy at Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "Last week, Glasner confirmed he would be leaving Palace at the end of the season when his contract expires. He later went on to criticise the Palace board for agreeing Marc Guehi's exit from Selhurst Park, the day before a game.",
      "This led to crunch talks, where the decision was ultimately made to stick with Glasner. MEN Sport understands while Glasner has favoured a 3-4-2-1 formation at Selhurst Park, this would not play against him in the interview process.",
      "Amorim favoured the 3-4-2-1 system at United and one of the reasons for his departure was his refusal to deviate from the tactic despite the results not being good enough.",

      "Carrick put his arm around Sesko.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "After beating Manchester City, Michael Carrick was pictured with his arm around Benjamin Sesko. It was as if Carrick was saying 'don't worry, you're going to be an important part of my plans this season'.",
      "Sesko had scored three goals in his last two matches for Manchester United, but Carrick decided to name him on the bench in favour of playing with a striker-less front three against City.",
      "The Slovenia international would have been disappointed to lose his starting place and not even get off the bench in the Manchester derby, however, Carrick got every aspect of his team selection correct.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "It was heartening to see Carrick make a beeline for Sesko during the celebrations. The 44-year-old was a player himself and knows what it feels like to be dropped. Sesko would have appreciated the gesture from Carrick, who demonstrated his man-management skills in that brief moment.",
      "It felt like Sesko was coming to the boil just in time for the Manchester derby, and he will be desperate to continue his momentum when he receives the opportunity to feature again. His brace in the 2-2 draw against Burnley was brilliant and he followed that with a headed goal against Brighton in the FA Cup. Darren Fletcher was in charge as caretaker for both of those games, and he'd taken time to speak to Sesko individually before United's visit to Lancashire.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well. Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities.",
      "\"I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well. He had a few other opportunities there, another snapshot. It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive from the night really is his two goals.\"",
      "Sesko scored twice against Burnley.(Image: )",
      "When Fletcher subsequently spoke at Carrington, he played down his involvement in Sesko's brace, saying: \"He's the one who crossed the white line and did it for himself.",
      "\"I said we showed some video, but Ben has been working really, really hard. He's a really diligent lad, he trains well and he reviews his games meticulously, so he's been striving for that moment. I'm just fortunate that it came in the game I was in charge of, so I'm more than happy for him.\"",
      "United need an in-form Sesko to qualify for the Champions League this season, which must be the target, and Carrick will now try to coax further improvement from the 22-year-old.",
      "Speaking ahead of the Manchester derby, Carrick admitted he enjoys the challenge of improving players. \"Helping individuals is a big part of what I enjoy. I think if you improve the individuals, then you create a better team,\" he said, and helping Sesko wouldn't be a bad place to start.",
      "Carrick knew what he was doing by putting an arm around Sesko and having a quiet word in his ear last weekend. The centre-forward is hoping to end his first season at the club as strongly as possible.",

      "He said: \"I think it's a good debate to have. As good as he has been at times with Marseille - we mentioned some of the really good performances they've had against Newcastle, the game against PSG in the French Super Cup - at times, like tonight, and I know Liverpool are very good, I'm not really sure what he's trying to do.",

      "Having just got rid of one combustible head coach who rarely sticks to the script in public, Manchester United won't be rushing to appoint another. That's why Oliver Glasner's remarkable rant against his Crystal Palace bosses after defeat at Sunderland on Saturday was such a risk.",
      "Glasner's candidancy for the Old Trafford hotseat has dimmed a little in recent weeks, a downturn in results at Selhurst Park not helping him at a time when he needs his stock to be climbing. So getting the flamethrower out at the Stadium of Light on Saturday was an interesting strategy.",
      "Palace had just made it 10 games without a win when Glasner took studious aim at those above him for doing a deal with Manchester City for captain Marc Guehi on the eve of the game. Glasner had confirmed on Friday that he was leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season, and much like Ruben Amorim did in his final weekend at Old Trafford, the Austrian decided one public meltdown wasn't quite enough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"The players gave everything they could. We made no substitutions - look at the bench, there are just kids there,\" he said. \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",

      "This is a remarkable attack on the club employing him and the comparisons with Amorim's stunning broadside at United executives at Leeds earlier this month are obvious. Amorim's position became untenable after his remarks, but Palace seem determined to limp on with the manager who only eight months ago won them their first major trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim could be a loose cannon in press conferences at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "In truth, this has probably been coming all season. Glasner threatened to quit at the end of the summer transfer window if Guehi was sold to Liverpool. He won the battle that day, but he was never going to win the war. Palace's business model doesn't allow players of Guehi's quality to leave for free, so City's £20million offer was £20million they couldn't afford to turn down.",
      "None of this should really come as a surprise. Palace chairman Steve Parish has made the business plan clear often enough. Glasner referenced Eberechi Eze as well, but that was another transfer that looked a certainty all summer and is just what clubs like Palace have to do.",
      "It is depressing for Glasner, depressing for Palace, and depressing for most football fans that any club with the cheek to lay down a challenge to the elite soon finds the vultures circling overhead.",
      "This is what happens when a hungry and ambitious manager ends up taking charge at one of the Premier League's upwardly mobile, middle-class clubs. Andoni Iraola probably deserves more credit than he is getting for biting his tongue at Bournemouth when his players are sold from under him as well.",
      "Glasner and Iraola are two of the standout candidates for the Old Trafford vacancy, but are now balancing disappointing runs of form at the worst possible time, and both have lost their best player during January. You can understand the frustration.",

      "Granted, Glasner does have history here. He left Eintracht Frankfurt after disagreements with sporting director Markus Krosche over the strength of the squad, and at Wolfsburg, he clashed with Jorg Schmadtke over what he felt were broken promises to improve the squad.",
      "The common theme here is a manager pushing for more at clubs whose natural habitat is the middle ground. Is that enough to cast the 51-year-old as a loose cannon, or does a CV including a Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt and an FA Cup with Crystal Palace suggest he has earned a crack at the highest level?",
      "His ambitions would be easier to meet at an elite club, while he's hardly alone in being a manager or a head coach who sometimes disagrees with those above him. The challenge for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at United would be to manage that kind of personality rather than fall into the trap of a compliant yes-man.",
      "That's not to say Glasner is the outstanding candidate here. His CV does make him deserving of a crack at a bigger job, but there are concerns. Top of the list is that his best results have come with a back three, a system United will want to steer clear of. Recent results at Palace have also cost the club and Glasner momentum.",
      "Those are reasons for Berrada and Wilcox to think twice about approaching a manager who is on the market this summer and has Premier League experience. Worrying about what a boss with ambitions beyond the likes of Crystal Palace and Eintracht Frankfurt might say in public is not.",

      "Manchester United travel to Arsenal on Sunday looking to continue their good performance vs Manchester City(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may as well have been lauded as a tactical genius after Manchester United produced a performance which shocked the Premier League to beat Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford. On another day, had it not been for marginal offsides and some incredible reflex stops by Gianluigi Donnarumma, it could have been more.",
      "But United fans are not greedy, particularly after a performance that inspiring, and the hope is there that they can continue this form as they push for a spot in the top four. The game plan Carrick implemented against City was not expected considering how he liked his Middlesbrough team to dominate the ball in the Championship.",
      "However, he was pragmatic and had confidence his defence could keep out City's threats and hit them on the counter attack. This tactic worked to perfection. Senne Lammens made one ill-advised save for a shot that was going well off target but otherwise, had nothing to do.",
      "Meanwhile, at the other end, the Reds had ten shots, seven of which were on target. It was a case of quality over quantity and all of this came from just 32 per cent possession. The beauty of Carrick's game plan was how positive it was without the need to dominate the ball.",
      "United were patient, picked their moments and deserved the victory. While this game plan will need changing for matches against teams who the Reds, on paper, should be dominant over, they can copy and paste it for the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At Nottingham Forest this weekend, Arsenal had 60 per cent possession and tried their best to break down their opponents only to settle for a point. United sitting deep and then playing with pace on the break is arguably their best chance of stopping the runaway leaders.",
      "Mikel Arteta will be mindful of this but it is one thing knowing what is about to come, and another thing stopping it. However, what United need to be wary of, which they did not have to concern themselves with against City, is the Gunners' threat from set pieces.",
      "All the way back on the opening day of the season, United managed to hold their own against the north London club only to be caught out by a corner. There were suspicions of a foul which were waved away but Altay Bayindir was not strong enough and the goal was a poor one to concede.",
      "Last season, United were atrocious when it came to defending set pieces but they have managed to make some progress in the 2025/26 season. Lammens seems more commanding in the area and as a result, goals being conceded in this manner have dropped.",
      "But Arsenal are the specialists and you would expect this week, Carrick will be drilling in the importance of being alert at all times and how each set piece routine is a huge threat. The Gunners have the best squad in the Premier League and they are also a more physical side to most.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are wrecking balls at corners and United need to stand up and be counted. That is why you would expect Harry Maguire to start thanks to his aerial abilities.",
      "United have been accused of having a soft underbelly in the past but if they can replicate what they did against City at the Emirates Stadium, they will banish those criticisms.",

      "Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee has suffered a small injury. Zirkzee was absent from the squad to face Manchester City on Saturday afternoon due to the knock he picked up against Brighton.",
      "The Dutchman watched from the directors' box at Old Trafford as his team-mates secured a dominant 2-0 victory, which handed Michael Carrick a dream start to his interim role.",
      "United limited City to one shot on target and had three goals disallowed due to offside to seal the most impressive Manchester derby victory since the stunning win in the 2024 FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "When Patrick Dorgu scored with 14 minutes remaining, Zirkzee was pictured celebrating in the directors' box alongside Matthijs de Ligt, Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson and Shea Lacey.",
      "United sources have confirmed Zirkzee's absence was due to a knock he suffered against Brighton. The 24-year-old was captured telling a fan outside Old Trafford that he would be sidelined for \"two weeks\", and it remains to be seen whether the issue affects his future in the final two weeks of the January window.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Zirkzee was unhappy with his game time during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Amorim viewed him as an important squad member.",
      "Zirkzee has considered leaving United for the sake of minutes in January, and Italian club Roma have expressed an interest in signing him on loan for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "When asked about Roma's interest in Zirkzee, he responded: \"Man Utd said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago and they have not changed their minds.”",
      "The winter window closes on February 2, meaning Zirkzee should recover from his knock in time to leave United before the deadline, provided he is given the green light to depart, which is not guaranteed.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad and Zirkzee are the only senior forwards at United. Sesko was sidelined in November with a knee injury, while Cunha has missed three games this season.",

      "Casemiro and Diogo Dalot cel;ebrate Bryan Mbeumo's goal against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",
      "The Brazilian and Argentine arrived in the same summer and both fitted the bill for \"character\" and \"personality\". Nearly four years later, they keep delivering on that front.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is making a similar impact to Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "The debate over Manchester United's best signing since the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era is a short one. Bruno Fernandes stands head and shoulders above the rest in just about every category imaginable.",
      "The Portuguese is a big game player who has delivered time and again when it matters most. For quality, for impact, for longevity, he ticks every box. At the end of next week, he will celebrate six years at Old Trafford and he is still the best player at the club.",
      "United paid an initial £47million to sign Fernandes from Sporting and even if that fee rises to the potential £67million if every add-on is met, it will still be exceptional value. The 31-year-old could yet be approaching the endgame at Old Trafford, but if he does depart, it will leave a significant hole in the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes stands out for his quality, but also for his rarity. United's recruitment had been haphazard over the last 13 years and there haven't been anywhere near enough success stories to match Fernandes.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good free transfer, but his impact was short-term. Luke Shaw looks a good deal because of the length of time he has survived at the club. Ander Herrera was a solid acquisition, so too Casemiro, although his fee was big for a 30-year-old. Lisandro Martinez might be up there but for the bad luck he has suffered with injuries.",
      "It is early days, but United's summer spending spree looks like a better investment. Senne Lammens has been good, Matheus Cunha has flickered and Benjamin Sesko has shown promise for a young striker. But Bryan Mbeumo sticks out above them all.",
      "The 26-year-old produced another exceptional attacking display in Saturday's derby victory, taking his goal superbly and running himself into the ground in a centre-forward role that demanded he pull City's defenders out of position. Mbeumo forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into an excellent save and looked to be relishing the big occasion.",
      "He has made a habit of that since his initial £65million move from Brentford in the summer. The question for players when they make a step up of that size is how they will cope in the harsher spotlight. Mbeumo had Premier League experience, but a CV consisting of Troyes and Brentford couldn't prepare him for this.",
      "That he has hit the ground running is a positive sign. It is exactly what Fernandes did in the second half of the 2019/20 season, when he immediately looked like he belonged and took responsibility in a United shirt.",
      "Mbeumo's return of eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances for United is good, but just as encouraging is who he has made an impact against. There have now been goals against Liverpool, Tottenham and City. He is proving key in the biggest games and after his performance at the weekend, he will fancy a crack at Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "He has a long way to go to match the contribution Fernandes has made at United, but this has been an excellent start. For too long, United managers have had to rely solely on Fernandes as the big-game hunter. He has always been the player you turn to when the team needs a spark.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is showing evidence that he can be there as well. It was no surprise that the two of them teamed up to create the first goal against Pep Guardiola's side at the weekend.",
      "Recruitment has long been a major issue at United, but Mbeumo is shaping up to be a success story.",

      "Incredibly, after one of the most impressive Manchester United performances in some time, the main sub-plot coming out of the Manchester derby is a rift between Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Lisandro Martinez. In the build-up to the derby, the former United midfielders gave a scathing critique of the Argentine on their podcast - The Good, The Bad and The Football.",
      "\"Martinez against [Erling] Haaland,\" Scholes said before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” The legendary midfielder added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "It was an outburst which raised eyebrows among the United fanbase as their comments went beyond normal punditry criticism, towards, at best, immature teasing of a professional footballer. Fittingly, Martinez started and impressed at Old Trafford on Saturday as he helped keep the Norwegian quiet, including producing a timely block to stop the striker.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With a 2-0 victory under their belt, it seemed the matter had been put to rest until the Argentine spoke in the mixed zone afterwards. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Scholes was quick to respond. \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar please Lisandro Martinez.\" For now, that is where the back and forth ends but the whole saga has threatened to overshadow what was a brilliant victory in Michael Carrick's return fixture.",
      "Martinez had every right to respond to Scholes after the victory over City and that result obviously empowered him to speak out. Scholes is also no stranger to ruffling a few feathers with his takes.",
      "Back in December, he branded Ruben Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo as 'b*******' while Butt and Scholes agreed they would advise him to leave United if he to asked their opinion. Pundits should never be mere mouthpieces for the clubs they used to play for.",
      "But some pundits and ex United players are not holding back. Gary Neville was cited by Amorim over claims his criticism was influencing the club's decision makers while Roy Keane was scathing about the appointment of Jonny Evans to the backroom staff and took a pot-shot at Carrick's wife on the Stick to Football podcast after a social media spat during the midfielder's playing days.",
      "In an age where outrage sells, especially on social media, it is unsurprising to see punditry comments become a bit clos to the bone. Martinez and other United players should also be encouraged to respond to it, if they see fit.",
      "But, Martinez and his teammates are only in their right to respond if they are happy to hold their hands up when things are not going as well. It is telling when United win a match, social media is awash with posts from the squad celebrating and thanking the fans.",
      "Yet, when they lose, apologies are few and far between. Perhaps this is partly down to PRs advising their clients to keep quiet but it does come across as disingenuous to seemingly only comment after a win.",
      "Now that both men have had their say, it is time for a line to be drawn underneath this saga and for Martinez to continue doing his talking on the pitch. If he continues to perform well, the critics will have little reason to speak out.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",

      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "There are a couple of league tables that feel pretty significant this morning.",
      "The first is a Champions League table that has five Premier League teams camped inside the all-important top eight, and a non-zero chance that after the matchday-eight madness that number is actually six.",
      "And then there’s the newly published Deloitte Football Money League that has every member of the Premier League’s Big Six inside its top 10, with only the continental behemoths of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain ahead.",
      "Perhaps more striking still is that three more Premier League sides – Aston Villa, Newcastle and West Ham – all make the top 20. And it only gets more absurd the further down the list you go; half the top 30 are Premier League teams. Brentford had higher revenues in 24/25 than any South American club.",
      "It’s a reminder, along with the recent domestic struggles of your Tottenhams and Manchester Uniteds in an increasingly competitive division, of just how huge the Premier League’s baked-in advantage over the rest of Europe and therefore the world now is.",
      "There is no other country that could even conceive of having six teams cruising through the Champions League league stage as the English clubs have this season. A quick look at the worst-performing team from the other big leagues – none of whom, of course, have as many as six entrants to begin with – is stark.",
      "Villarreal sit second bottom with just a point to their name after seven games. Eintracht Frankfurt have fared little better and are also out of contention altogether before the final matchday of a league format specifically and deliberately designed to minimise jeopardy. Napoli currently sit outside the top 24.",
      "And even above them, any or all of Marseille, Leverkusen, Monaco and Athletic Club could yet tumble and miss even the play-off safety net.",
      "England’s worst-performing team is Manchester City, who even in the absolute worst-case scenario can now finish no lower than 18th.",
      "And this at a time when five of the Big Six would consider themselves to be, in general, underperforming this season. Even not in peak condition, these six teams remain among the very best in the Champions League, their superiority baked in yet further by the added advantage of being kept apart from each other throughout the league phase. Five Champions League places already feels inevitable for next season.",
      "Tottenham are the 14th best team in England but the fifth best in the entire continent. You’re tempted to say ‘make it make sense’ but it’s actually pretty depressingly easy to make it make sense. The bloated Champions League league stage is a lower overall standard than the Premier League.",
      "The only real surprise in Spurs’ lofty standing is the fact three Premier League teams sit below them.",
      "You could chuck plenty more Premier League teams into the Champions League and they would most likely also finish in the top 24 qualifying positions.",
      "Aston Villa and Manchester United most obviously, but really anyone currently above Spurs in the table has proof of concept.",
      "There are other factors of course. There’s little doubt that Spurs specifically are playing with far greater freedom with the pressure off to an extent in a Champions League where relatively little is expected of them and failure is legitimately hard to achieve; they are clearly less burdened and shackled by fear and tension on European nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where they haven’t lost any of their last 24 games, than on Premier League days.",
      "The fact Spurs have won as many Champions League games as Premier League games on their own patch since the start of 2025 is both hilarious and ridiculous, but also revealing.",
      "English clubs, in truth, underperformed in last season’s Champions League. Yet they still produced a semi-finalist, a quarter-finalist and a team that dominated the league stage only to find themselves unfortunate to come up against what was by the time of the first knockout round the best team in the competition.",
      "And it still took members of the tiny handful of European powerhouses who can still vaguely compete with any of the Premier League big guns on an even keel to eliminate them: Real Madrid knocked out Man City, and PSG took care of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – notably finding each of them far harder nuts to crack than finalists Inter.",
      "And the three members of the Premier League’s Big Six who found themselves outside the Big Cup just casually dominated the lesser trophies, with Spurs beating Man United in the Europa League final and Chelsea winning the Conference League while yawning and absent-mindedly scratching their arse throughout.",
      "But the Deloitte numbers also show why, even now as it feels like it’s disintegrating on the Premier League pitch, it is still correct to talk about the Big Six. Spurs’ revenues still dwarf those of Villa and Newcastle, never mind supposed European giants like Atletico Madrid or Juve or the Milan clubs.",
      "The fact Villa’s wage bill is significantly higher than Tottenham’s – and terrifyingly close to Manchester United’s – is a sign of a problem approaching rapidly over the hill for the midlands club rather than evidence they have compellingly displaced silly Spurs.",
      "And here too another reminder that while Villa’s frustration and anger at what they perceive as rules designed to protect that Big Six and force them to operate with one hand behind their back is understandable, their direction for that irritation is entirely misplaced.",
      "Villa should not look at Spurs and think ‘unfair’. They should look at Spurs as the example to follow. Not on the pitch, obviously. Don’t do that, whatever you do. But off the pitch.",
      "For all their myriad faults, their undeniable and unending banter-club status, the one thing Spurs have got impressively right over the last two decades is making that elite cabal a Big Six in the first place, and how they went about it. Say what you like about Spurs – and we do, frequently – but they did not bet the house on shortcutting their way in as Villa are currently attempting or follow Newcastle’s own dubious attempt at the Man City or Chelsea approach.",
      "And that’s why even now, as Spurs reel around on the fringes of a genuine relegation fight and Villa have at this time thoroughly and conspicuously overtaken them on the pitch, those Deloitte numbers and Champions League table still tell a tale of how and why the idea of the Big Six persists and prevails."

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage reaching the Christmas break, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results across all three competitions.",
      "All six of England’s Champions League representatives are now assured of play-off spots at worst. Arsenal will definitely finish in the top eight and go straight to the last 16, while it’s not inconceivable that all of the other five could do so. Remember, there are bonus points on offer based on your finishing positions and last-16 participation, so that will all help boost the pot.",
      "Villa and Forest are in good shape in the Europa League, while Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "Total points: 125.375\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nPlay-off round: Crystal Palace (UECL)\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL)",
      "",
      "Yes, it’s a surprise name currently in second place until you scratch the surface. First, with only four teams in European competition every individual win is worth half a point. Add in the fact that all four of Poland’s teams are in the Conference, where the league stage is over and the bonus points for finishing positions dished out, and it all starts to make sense.",
      "Will obviously fall off as the stagger unwinds, but they will still be picking up points here and there for a while yet.",

      "Alarm bells begin with the very first word of the sub-headline: ‘COMMENT.’",
      "Let’s linger for a minute on that Express piece, which is a wonderful piece of fan fiction…",
      "Given United finished 15th and didn’t qualify for Europe last season, attracting a player of Palmer’s calibre might seem a little fan fetched, but a gift could be about to fall into the palms of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Co. That’s because according to some reports, Palmer hasn’t properly settled into life down south and could look to move closer to his Manchester home.",
      "A ‘gift’! Do gifts usually cost the receiver over £100m?",
      "Oh and let’s gloss over the fact that those reports (in The Sun) actually claim that ‘the Blues No10 could well be tempted to return to his former club’ because boo, hiss, who cares about Chelsea and Manchester City when you can posit that Palmer could join This Is Manchester United We Are Talking About?",
      "And posit Amos Murphy does. At length.",
      "And if Palmer is feeling homesick, as certain reports have suggested, it narrows down the list of potential suitors to basically just United anyway. It’s difficult to imagine a world where Palmer is rocking up at Anfield as Mohamed Salah’s replacement, and while he did come through the City academy, that ship feels like it sailed a while ago.",

      "Adopting the opposite approach to Ruben Amorim, using Harry Maguire as a dressing-room influencer and ignoring loud-mouthed former players are among the keys to Michael Carrick’s nine-day revolution at Manchester United.",
      "The Red Devils couldn’t have got off to a better start on the pitch under the interim boss, as they tore Manchester City apart in a hugely impressive 2-0 victory on Saturday, in a display which drew parallels with the Sir Alex Ferguson era for the first time in a very long time at Old Trafford.",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Man Utd pair storm into top three",
      "And a report from Mirror has also detailed some of the changes Carrick has made behind the scenes to transform what was a downbeat mood under his predecessor.",
      "Upon interviewing Carrick, the report claims that both Joel and Avi Glazer, along with Sir Jim Ratcliffe, were ‘engrossed in the words which spilled from his lips’ before presumably going for a cold shower.",
      "He told them he was ‘invested in quality more than quantity’ in training and match preparation, insisting ‘being honest was just as valuable as having the ball at their feet on the training ground’. Club sources claim Ratcliffe was impressed with his “calm and intelligent demeanour” in those discussions.",
      "Recognising there would likely be a ‘step-up in enthusiasm and energy’ upon his arrival – a new-manager bounce – Carrick spoke to Steve Holland ahead of the first training session to ensure they ‘took full advantage of an improved mood’ before handing the assistant coach ‘free reign to plan and take sessions at Carrington’.",
      "According to the report, ‘the players have been impressed with the attention to detail’ in what have been ‘shorter and more intense’ sessions than they were used to under Amorim.",
      "Meanwhile, Maguire was enlisted to ‘make it clear to his teammates how United had re-hired someone with the club’s principles running through his blood’.",
      "Carrick has also encouraged the squad not to rush home after games as he ‘wants relationships to build and flourish’ and so that he can ‘see which ones work and which ones don’t’, while taking the time to speak to individual players, particularly those who feel they’re on the fringes of the squad.",
      "He’s also taking ‘the opposite attitude’ to Amorim when it comes to feedback. While the Portuguese boss would often send players home after games without talking to them, Carrick insists on ‘no-one leaving the home dressing room without feeling appreciated’.",
      "United will arrive for games later than they did under Amorim to avoid them ‘hanging around before kick-off’ and to ensure ‘his squad get the best greeting possible’ from the fans.",
      "The last week, while hugely positive in general for United, has also seen some toxic punditry – if we can even call it that – from Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt make headlines.",
      "Carrick has ‘refused to get involved’ and has ‘made it clear to his players and coaching staff that there are far more pressing – and important – problems to fix’.",
      "Cole Palmer might be surprised to wake up to news that he ‘wants’ a transfer to Manchester United.",
      "With Marc Guehi now off this list, it’s topped by two other centre-halves – only one of which is likely to sign a new contract.",
      "Gyokeres has dropped again but not as much as Eze, while the top three (unbelievably) features a Man Utd pair. Here’s the latest top 20 summer transfers ranking.",
      "January is an odd window and these five possible deals that could be done before the deadline feel more particularly peculiar…",
      "Mikel Arteta would be ‘absolutely bonkers’ to make one selection call against Manchester United, while a ‘theory’ has emerged that Pep Guardiola will resign.",
      "Tottenham ‘approached’ Michael Carrick over the possibility of replacing Thomas Frank before he was appointed Man Utd interim boss, according to reports."

      "Tottenham Hotspur are acutely aware of interest from Liverpool and Manchester United in centre-back Micky van de Ven, and they have responded by slapping a huge price tag on his head.",
      "We have previously revealed that Spurs’ ambition is to tie Van de Ven down to a new long-term deal, which would see his salary doubled so he would earn similar terms to the club’s highest earners: Conor Gallagher and Cristian Romero.",
      "We reported how Tottenham’s CEO, Vinai Venkatesham, opened initial talks with the Dutch international’s camp over the summer. He views a new deal for the defender as a top priority.",
      "However, Spurs are also aware that given their current struggles, there is little chance of persuading van de Ven to sign, so those talks are not progressing at any sort of pace.",
      "Sources indicate that Liverpool are fully aware of Van de Ven’s situation at Tottenham and very much like the 24-year-old as a long‑term defensive solution.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, are keeping pace, having tracked the centre-back since his Wolfsburg days and viewing him as an ideal profile for their rebuild.",
      "Both clubs admire his blend of recovery pace, composure, and left‑sided balance – attributes that are increasingly rare and, as it turns out, extremely expensive.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Given the interest gathering around Van de Ven, we understand from sources with knowledge of the situation that Tottenham have slapped the £100million price tag on him.",
      "Should Van de Ven leave for £100million, he would become the most expensive defender in football history, surpassing the £80million United spent on Harry Maguire in 2019.",
      "Sources suggest Spurs are fully aware that such a valuation will deter most suitors, but with their season faltering and uncertainty creeping in, they know they cannot afford to look weak in the market.",
      "Tottenham remain hopeful they tie Van de Ven down to an even bigger, long‑term contract, rewarding him for his rapid rise and cementing him as a cornerstone of their future.",
      "But given the club’s current trajectory, insiders admit there is little chance the Dutchman will commit to fresh terms.",
      "That leaves Spurs in a precarious position: a prized asset attracting heavyweight attention, a player reluctant to extend, and a valuation designed to keep the vultures at bay – at least for now.",
      "Liverpool and United will continue to monitor the situation closely, but so will others and we are told Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are fully aware of the situation, too.",
      "Meanwhile, my colleague, Dean Jones, has reported that Tottenham are still planning to make a ‘major’ signing before this month’s transfer window closes – and they are focusing on bringing in a new winger.",
      "With Yan Diomande unavailable and Antoine Semenyo joining Manchester City, they have switched their attention to West Ham star Crysencio Summerville.",
      "In other news, manager Thomas Frank remains under intense scrutiny, despite Spurs’ 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.",
      "Behind the scenes, the club’s hierarchy are doing their due diligence on potential replacements. However, reports suggest that former United manager Ruben Amorim, who has been linked with the role, is not an option for Spurs.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘in talks’ over re-signing Mason Greenwood, while an update has emerged regarding Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Greenwood progressed through the ranks at Man Utd and was expected to be a key player for his boyhood club for most of his career.",
      "However, Man Utd had no choice but to offload Greenwood after he faced charges relating to attempted rape and assault.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service eventually discontinued the case against Greenwood as the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction.",
      "Man Utd also conducted an internal investigation into the matter and they faced a PR disaster by keeping Greenwood, who was sent on loan to La Liga side Getafe in the 2023 summer transfer window.",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Man Utd pair storm into top three",
      "Greenwood impressed on the pitch for Getafe and joined Marseille in the 2024 summer transfer window for around £26m.",
      "Man Utd sold Greenwood below his market value, but they have a couple of clauses in their favour, including a 50% sell-on clause and a potential buy-back clause.",
      "The 24-year-old has 42 goals and 12 assists in his 63 appearances for Marseille over the past 18 months and has been heavily linked with moves elsewhere, with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid among those linked with him.",
      "These possibilities would benefit Man Utd financially as they would stand to receive an extra £25m+ with their sell-on clause, but a new report from Football Insider claims they are ‘in talks’ over ‘bringing Greenwood back’ to the club.",
      "Man Utd chiefs should hang their heads in shame if there is any truth to this report and it would still be a PR nightmare if they or another English side sanctions his return to the Premier League.",
      "The report from Football Insider adds: ‘Man United officials have internally discussed the idea of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club, sources have told Football Insider.",
      "‘The Red Devils included a buy-back clause when they sold the 24-year-old right winger to Marseille in the summer of 2024, where they can sign the attacker for a knockdown fee less than his worth in the current market.’",
      "This deal is surely unlikely, but Man Utd are far more likely to sign at least two midfielders in the summer and could sell captain Bruno Fernandes to raise funds for these moves.",
      "Fernandes has been heavily linked with a potential move to the Saudi Pro League over the past year, but a new report from ESPN claims the Red Devils are keen for him to remain at the club beyond this season.",
      "The report explains: ‘Manchester United are planning talks with captain Bruno Fernandes about his future ahead of the World Cup with club bosses poised to tell the midfielder they want to keep him at Old Trafford for at least one more year, sources have told ESPN.",
      "‘Fernandes came close to joining Al Hilal last summer and there is expected to be more interest in the Portugal international at the end of the current campaign. However, the club’s preference is to keep their captain in what will be another transitional summer with a new permanent manager set to arrive to replace Ruben Amorim.’",

United will decide whether to pursue an opportunity in January, possibly in midfield or attack, or to keep the current squad until the summer.",

      "The report claims: ‘They have already submitted a formal offer. The proposal is around 20 million pounds, just under 23 million euros. A significant sum considering the player’s contract expires in six months.",
      "‘At Old Trafford, they see it as a market opportunity. They prefer to pay now and secure the signing rather than enter a summer bidding war. Furthermore, Rúben Neves himself would be willing to facilitate the transfer.’",
      "Man Utd have now made a final decision to keep Kobbie Mainoo at Old Trafford after getting “instant trust” from Michael Carrick, says Fabrizio Romano.",

      "While one Arsenal player forces his way to the top a couple of his teammates are drifting and Viktor Gyokeres is still terrible. Meanwhile Manchester United’s trio are all trending upwards.",
      "We’ve now got all 20 of the Premier League’s most expensive summer transfers in the ranking following Yoane Wissa’s long-awaited return to fitness.",
      "Here’s where the players ranked three games into the Premier League season and after nine and then 15, with their previous positions included in brackets.",
      "",
      "All of his personal gripes with Newcastle and their ‘broken promises’ considered, along with the injustice surrounding the imbalance of power between clubs and players with regard to contracts, we can’t help but feel quite pleased he’s having an absolute mare at Liverpool.",
      "Any hope that the floodgates might open after his first Premier League goal against West Ham – a fine finish it was too – faded dramatically with arguably even worse performances to strengthen claims that Isak might just be the biggest flop in Premier League history before yet another injury.",
      "Here’s to his speedy recovery as a) injuries are sh*t and b) watching Isak play football is now brilliant no matter how he performs. Back to his best? Great, he’s a wonderful striker. Still terrible? Flopping excellent.",
      "",
      "We all nodded in agreement with Dave Tickner’s sage assertion that while Elanga might not be worth £55m to any other team, he was to Newcastle because of their excellence in transition on the counter-attack, but are now very much distancing ourselves from that fool of a journalist/man.",
      "In over 1000 minutes he has no goals, just two assists, has spent half the time watching Jacob Murphy from the bench and has forced Eddie Howe into fielding one of his two left wingers in his position on the right.",
      "This graph from football analysis experts Gradient Sports tells you what you need to know…",
      "",
      "A more than cheeky £30m offer from Fenerbahce for Wissa, six months after his protracted £55m transfer from Brentford and just 477 minutes into his Newcastle career gives a pretty clear indication as to how they view his time thus far on Tyneside.",
      "Having missed the first four months of the season either sulking to force the transfer, injured, or both, he’s scored three goals since returning to action at the start of December – though he was excellent v PSV – currently making him flop adjacent; full status is in the post.",
      "",
      "The abiding memories of Sesko’s contribution to English football so far are him stepping up 10th in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far, and getting injured when clean through against Tottenham.",
      "A brace against Burnley to double his United goals tally offered promise that was quickly and fairly comprehensively extinguished when he didn’t make it off the bench in Michael Carrick’s first game in charge against Manchester City, which was also The Best Manchester United Performance Since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "",
      "We were concerned for a while that Arsenal fans were becoming indestructible such was the way they brushed off perfectly valid criticism of Gyokeres on their seemingly inexorable path to the Premier League title.",
      "But the quite remarkable return of pessimism despite a seven-point lead in the league and a 100 per cent record in the Champions League. has granted us access once more to poke at the brittle Gunners psyche and Gyokeres’ frankly shocking form is the standout pressure point.",
      "His fine finish against Inter on Tuesday was overdue as his only goal since November 1 in the Premier League came from the penalty spot against Everton. But Gabriel Jesus scored a brace in that game and with Kai Havertz still waiting in the wings Gyokeres will surely soon find himself out of the starting line-up in games that matter if he puts in insipid displays as he did against Nottingham Forest.",
      "",
      "He’s done some good things – a stunner against Wolves in the League Cup, a nice assist in defeat at Leeds – but still feels nailed on to be the next young forward to drown in stagnant pool of attacking talent that Stamford Bridge has become in the BlueCo era.",
      "He’s not started a Premier League game since the start of December and although looked decent in Liam Rosenior’s first game in charge against Charlton, won’t be at all encouraged by the new head coach starting Pedro Neto on the left against Arsenal or by Alejandro Garnacho coming off the bench to score a brace.",
      "",
      "He’s taken to Liverpool like a duck to a frozen pond, expecting to swim but landing arse up with his face in the ice.",
      "For a the first few weeks of the campaign he was playing as though he was constantly trying to make up for mistakes he hadn’t made yet but then duly did make in desperation to impress. He didn’t know where to be or what to do so tried to be everywhere doing everything, and was therefore usually nowhere, doing nothing.",
      "Arne Slot’s move to a style of football some would call functional and others would see as the most turgid sh*te they’ve witnessed at Anfield for many a moon has minimised the space allowed for mistakes, from Kerkez and any of the other culprits.",
      "But signed largely on the basis of his raiding attacking quality the shift has rather cut Kerkez off at the knees. He has one goal and no assists in 29 appearances in his debut season.",
      "",
      "Clearly a hugely talented footballer and the obvious suggestion is that he would thrive under a different, less conservative, more forward-thinking manager. We’re not quite so sure.",
      "The football happens all-too frequently around rather than through him and we could list a dozen high-profile playmakers who have arrived in the Premier League and left soon after for whom that was the case.",
      "",
      "A couple of goals off the bench against Arsenal followed by a nothing display against Brentford is Garnacho in a nutshell. The jury’s out and frankly we don’t expect them back in session for the rest of what looks to be a predictably frustrating season of infrequent highs from a base of lows.",
      "",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves was followed by a whole lot of guff from Reijnders, who’s shown glimpses of his quality and scored a few goals of late, but has done nothing like what we expected after that opening-day clinic.",
      "Large periods in games go by in which you forget he’s playing, which is quite the feat for a midfielder in a Pep Guardiola team.",
      "",
      "His first Arsenal goal being the winner against his former club and his next three all coming against the Gunners’ bitter north London rivals whom he was days even hours away from joining instead of them all adds to what was an already pretty clear sense that Eze’s return to his boyhood club was meant to be.",
      "But those were his only four goals and his failure to displace a horribly out-of-form Martin Odegaard from the Premier League starting XI doesn’t bode at all well for Eze’s short-term Arsenal future or for his World Cup chances. He’s featured for just 23 minutes across the last six Premier League games, failing to make it off the bench in four of them.",
      "",
      "We may may never have been more invested in an Arsenal signing doing well after the #NOTOMADUEKE petition but have also struggled with the thought of those unthinkable tw*ts lacking any sort of human decency being allowed to enjoy the football he’s playing.",
      "Here’s hoping they hung their heads in shame as his piledriver against Club Brugge cannoned in off the underside of the crossbar in recognition that they are wholly underserving of nice things. We fear the I Told You So-ists will soon be crawling from the woodwork with Madueke struggling for end product of late.",
      "",
      "Wirtz has dropped down the growing list of Liverpool problems Arne Slot has to deal with, not least because he appears to be relatively low maintenance in comparison to others (or An Other).",
      "It’s not clear whether a slight uptick in his performances is down to Wirtz’s slow adaptation to the Premier League or if a guy with that much talent is bound to show some quality if afforded enough time on the pitch. We suspect the latter but it doesn’t really matter.",
      "There has been notable improvement but he still needs to do a helluva lot more to ease doubts over his suitability to be the face of the New Liverpool in a post-Mohamed Salah era.",
      "Nothing is quite at the elite yet but it’s all looking decent…",
      "",
      "Genuine hope that Chelsea may have found a fully-formed striker to lead their attack after two goals and three assists in his opening four Premier League games has since faded into questions as to whether the Brazilian would even be in a Blues XI looking to challenge for major honours in future after a further five goals and one assist in his last 18 top flight games.",
      "While Liam Delap has so far failed to prove he’s the answer as the furthest man forward, he looks more suited to that role than Pedro, who thrives in a more withdrawn position which is sure to be occupied by Cole Palmer assuming Pedro Neto or Estevao play on the right flank.",
      "He’s a fine footballer and has proven himself worthy of the step up from Brighton, but he’s not the top striker Chelsea needed and still need.",
      "",
      "We will forever have a soft spot for footballers who don’t look as though they should be good at football. Combine that with him being the cause of great mirth for naysayers in the summer having joined for a fee way above his market value as Newcastle’s fourth or fifth-choice striker and him having to replace £125m defector Isak and we were tucking into veritable jambalaya of joy at seeing Woltemade’s early goalscoring form at St James’ Park.",
      "But he’s failed to score in any of his last seven appearances and the brace against Chelsea just before Christmas were his only goals in his last 13 games.",
      "",
      "Started superbly with five goals and an assist in his first seven games to raise questions as to why Liverpool spent £125m on another striker, then endured a barren spell with no goals or assists in 12 games – largely off the bench – while Slot tried and failed to bed in his £125m striker, before he scored five goals in three games upon being reinstated to the starting XI to again raise questions as to why they signed an alternative £125m striker.",
      "Liverpool shouldn’t have signed the £125m striker.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham’ caveat have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs this term.",
      "He has ploughed a lone furrow as Spurs’ only real attacking outlet for much of the season under Thomas Frank and could very easily return from injury in April to play under a different manager.",
      "",
      "Four goals and two assists in 21 appearances isn’t enough but Cunha has this wonderful magnetic energy; stuff just happens around him on the football pitch.",
      "He’s one of our absolute favourite players to watch and has already proven beyond doubt – despite those relatively weak numbers – that he has the character required to avoid cowing under the pressure at Old Trafford as so many big-money signing have done before him.",
      "",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo looks to have bucked a very long trend in being a high-quality footballer who arrives at Old Trafford and continues being that very same high-quality footballer.",
      "Eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances is a very serviceable return and we can expect the hit-rate to increase should he continue to play in the No.9 position after his goal in the Manchester derby.",
      "",
      "As suckers for low stress, technically brilliant defensive midfielders we suspect we will be swooning over the Spaniard for a long time yet. While so many others struggle to come to terms with the pace and power of the Premier League, his transition has been seamless. His goal against Chelsea was sublime. Just a hugely impressive footballer.",
      "Cole Palmer might be surprised to wake up to news that he ‘wants’ a transfer to Manchester United.",
      "Adopting the opposite approach to Amorim, using Maguire as a dressing-room influencer and ignoring loud-mouthed former players. This is Carrick’s Man Utd.",
      "With Marc Guehi now off this list, it’s topped by two other centre-halves – only one of which is likely to sign a new contract.",
      "January is an odd window and these five possible deals that could be done before the deadline feel more particularly peculiar…",
      "Mikel Arteta would be ‘absolutely bonkers’ to make one selection call against Manchester United, while a ‘theory’ has emerged that Pep Guardiola will resign.",
      "We know Oliver Glasner will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the season (or sooner) but who is set to take over?"

      "In their brief time together as part of a podcast trio alongside Paddy McGuinness (who has been chosen to hold court on this Man Utd-centric podcast despite being a Bolton Wanderers supporter), it has become clear that they will stoop to embarrassing lows in the means of content to get eyes on their podcast, which is far inferior to others in the same bracket.",
      "READ: Are Butt and Scholes just ‘jealous’ as Man Utd fans turn on Class of 92?",
      "But they are sharing the stage with fellow prick and renowned pundit troll O’Hara.",
      "There is some good to be found on talkSPORT‘s website and radio stations, but some regular contributors, including O’Hara, are simply brought in to play up to their clown character and spout nonsense to garner angry reactions from their readers/listeners.",
      "There is endless evidence of O’Hara making brainless statements, i.e. suggesting Xabi Alonso could replace Thomas Frank at Spurs after Robbie Keane takes interim charge. But his assertion that he would be an “above average” Premier League footballer if he played today takes the biscuit.",
      "“I was an average footballer [when I played in the Premier League]. I think I would be above average now,” O’Hara said on talkSPORT.",

      "Carlton Cole responded: “Do you reckon?”",
      "O’Hara continued: “100%. Everyone are crabs mate, all they do is pass it sideways, backwards, keep the ball, [everyone’s] scared to take risks. I see crab football 24/7. I think the quality in the Premier League has gone downhill and people are turning away”.",
      "Then, Cole opted to gloss over O’Hara’s baffling claim about his own ability, or lackthereof, as a footballer and focused on current Premier League players often deciding against “taking risks” as they “rely more on the system to come through for them”.",
      "This did not stop O’Hara from doubling down, though. He added: “When were talking about the top, the highest level is still there. I’m talking about the average Premier League footballer and I think [they have] got worse. I genuinely do”.",
      "O’Hara has clumsily fallen en route to making a semi-agreeable point regarding the declining standards in the Premier League.",
      "However, he does so by egotistically making it all about him and being miles off the mark in the process, which is par for the course with O’Hara.",
      "For acknowledging and replying to O’Hara’s statements, we are feeding into what he and the outlets he works for want. But sometimes, a person’s prickery needs to be called out, and he is one of the biggest of them all in football today.",

Butt, with a season’s worth of Premier League appearances under his belt when Hansen made his quip in the summer of 1995, put on his big boy pants and eventually won six titles and the Champions League with United. Which makes him well placed to know what it takes and how hard the job is, even as part of a functional football club.",

Not that players of that era ever did because then they would have missed their rating out of 10 and that wasn’t the done thing, no matter how hard many might insist they didn’t read them.",
      "The internet was barely A Thing in 1995 when Hansen sent Butt spiralling. And he left Old Trafford in 2004 long before social media became the wall-to-wall, 24-hour scourge it now is for modern players.",
      "Of course, United are all too willing to capitalise on the exposure offered by the intensified spotlight. They sell themselves to players by offering a level of profile impossible to achieve anywhere but a handful of other clubs.",
      "But then United put these stars on the biggest of stages and set them up to fail, usually by failing to operate as a football club serious in achieving its stated aims.",
      "The players often don’t help themselves and, sure, some have been given such a platform only because of the falling standards at Old Trafford.

      "On Saturday evening I posted on BlueSky that I didn’t think Oliver Glasner would still be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season.",
      "However, I am not particularly surprised that the club’s response to his outbursts has been to keep him in post. This is, after all, a club that values its principles enough to stick to them even when straying from them would have brought more success, at least in the short term, according to an article I wrote for this site back in 2016. Jesus of Montreal I didn’t realise it was that long ago.",
      "I have some sympathy for Glasner, because the timing of the decision to sell Marc Guehi (and therefore withdraw him from selection for the Sunderland game) was about as bad as it could get. At the same time, it seems hugely unlikely that he would not have been aware of the negotiations taking place, and must have expected this would happen eventually, so there’s no real excuse for being caught out by it.",
      "Glasner’s main mistake, however, is not spinning the story his way. His previous comments have suggested he wants about 20 first team-calibre players but wants to pick the same starting XI when everyone is fit. The first of those is the preserve of the biggest clubs, and while it’s a nice ambition to have, there’s a reason clubs the size of Palace tend to fall into the second group.",
      "While his squad on Saturday was, as Harry Redknapp might say, down to the bare bones, it was almost the perfect opportunity to make his case to the board: “I used the players I had available but they’re not ready for the Premier League yet, we need reserves who are”. Instead, he made no substitutions, even with his team 2-1 down with 20 minutes to play, a move that came across as petulance bordering on unprofessionalism.",
      "This is where I have sympathy for the board: by their standards they did spend significant money (approximately £50m) in the summer on fleshing out the squad, something they likely did knowing they’d receive a big fee for Eberechi Eze. For Glasner’s talk of having his heart broken, Palace did make a good start to the season, even without Eze. If the timeline we’ve been told about is correct, then Glasner informed the board he was going to leave at the end of his contract. Despite knowing this, they still broke their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson, a player described as a perfect fit for Glasner’s system, in January. It’s not reasonable to expect a club to spend a fortune every time their manager has a fit of pique, even if there will always be the lingering suspicion that a couple of judicious signings in the summer might have avoided all of this.",
      "Where the board deserve some credit is in (at least as of 3pm on Monday) not being so fragile of ego as to sack Glasner for his insolence. I don’t expect they’re happy about what their manager has said, but it’s definitely the reaction of a grown-up to treat it for what it is, an outburst rooted in frustration and a situation that can be mediated, if not fully repaired. It’s fair to say that plenty of club directors would not have given Glasner this much leeway and you have to wonder if potential employers are having second thoughts about appointing him.",

To be in the top 6 every year? Champions League every year? Title race? Ok, but ahead of who? There are 7 other teams who want all that and can realistically achieve it – which of those should Spurs be displacing? Which of the midtable sides – Everton, Sunderland, Brentford, Brighton, Palace, etc – are Spurs entitled to be ahead of?",
      "The fact bears repeating: Spurs finished *17th* last year. Obviously their fans immediately spring into action when this is pointed out: ‘oh, we won a European trophy!’ Brilliant, let me know how following in West Ham’s footsteps is working out for you. ‘Oh we were concentrating on Europe, we could have finished higher in the league, we just didn’t want to.’ Yeah ok. Maybe you shouldn’t have sacked the manager who masterminded this false rubbishness in that case? And just told him, g’day, we want to finish higher in the league this year mate. Yeah, 1st would be lovely actually mate. Have a VB.",

Superclubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, etc feel they’re entitled to skip this part of the experience. Spurs are not these clubs. Their fans think they are long-suffering. They are not.",
      "Look at the defensive players Frank has got to work with: Paulinha has the brain of a dog; Udogie and Porro are complete disgracia; Spence acts like a child on Supernanny. Spurs fans won’t hear anything said against their centre backs, but they are objectively average: Van der Ven can run fast and Romero kicks people and complains a lot, wow. Maybe stop people from scoring occasionally? And Vicario.",
      "But Frank is getting a better tune out of his back 6/7 than anyone since the last time Spurs finished above Arsenal. They’ve conceded over 60 goals for the last 3 seasons in a row; this year they’re on course to concede 50. And aside from Arsenal, they have the best away record in the league – a sign that when they can keep games tight and put the onus on the opposition, they can be successful. It’s not hard to find signs that Frank is actually improving this team, if anyone has the patience to look. Granted, not relative to the imaginary version of Tottenham that their mad fans have in their heads; but relative to the one in the real world that, apart from the worst set of promoted sides since the competition started, was the *worst team* in the premier league last season. Pretend this wasn’t true if it makes you feel better, knock yourself out.",
      "Obviously, Spurs’ problem in translating this quiet improvement into more points and better home form is, constructing coherent attacks and scoring a lot more goals. But how does a new manager fix this? Richarlison is their best attacking player. *Richarlison*. Unless Ryan Mason CDXXVII can give Maddison new legs and find a 20 goal a year striker down the back of the sofa, where do the goals come from? Tel? Simons? I mean, we’re immediately talking the transfer market aren’t we?",
      "Unless the plan is to hire a new manager and tell them, you can’t sign any new players because actually we already have one of the best 4 squads in the country. If so, I have some bad news. But if it is time to sound the warchest klaxon, then it’s implicit that the current squad is not good enough for what is apparently desired.

But when the required quality is lacking, you can’t expect a sub-standard striker to produce those flashes more regularly. Sometimes, your expensive frontman is only able to impact games sporadically because that’s his ceiling.",
      "Rob’s argument for Gyokeres doing fine doesn’t really touch on his ability though – it seems entirely based around Arsenal sitting pretty in mid-January with him in the team. Arteta picks him for the team top of the league, and he’s an actual football manager, so if you think he’s crap, you are clearly wrong sir. But it doesn’t work that way does it? Anyone who’s watched a middling amount of Arsenal this season will tell you that he’s struggled badly.",
      "Isn’t it possible, or even probable, that Arsenal would be in an even stronger position if they’d invested in a striker who was at a level consistent with the rest of their team? 10-15 points clear with no lingering doubts over their goal threat maybe? Gyokeres really doesn’t pass the eye test – poor goal return, minimal contribution, looks laboured and out of sync when he does get involved. The frequent rush to highlight his effort and attitude has been a giveaway to be honest – it’s a classic case of damning with faint praise. Hojlund often got the same sympathetic treatment when charging after a pass down a channel only for it to bounce off his knee out of play.",
      "You can be top of the league, top of the Champions League etc., but still have some weak links Rob. And it’s hard to term Gyokeres as anything other than that up to this point. You’re rightly happy with a season that’s well on track in spite of his struggles. But if it ends with a trophy (or more than one), it might be fairer to laud the strength of the squad around him than trying to say that he must be good just because Arteta made him part of it.\nKeith Reilly",

      "I agree with much of what Gofezo says and I enjoyed your mail Sir/Ma’am. Apart from one thing: “Secondly, too much change and too many injuries means the team isn’t playing anywhere near its potential – yes yes every team has these, but how many times has changing the manager miraculously fixed everything? ”",
      "My problem with this is the way he has set up the team; it’s just so f**king boring to watch. My belief is it’s the system not the injuries or the bedding in. I’d honestly relinquish a few places in the table in exchange for some excitement. The infinite horseshoe tactic is the worst thing I’ve seen in all the years I’ve watched them play (mid 80s – god I’m old). A new manager coming in may actually release the shackles and let them play with expression and freedom we so desperately lack at the moment. Point taken though, let’s ride the season out. Nagelsmann, Alonso, hell even Alan bloody Pardew might be a more exciting shout.",

      "During the match, Pickford’s towel is repeatedly filched by Spanish ball boys and staff members. You might normally say it was a bit of a prank. Quite unprofessional, but ball boys can sometimes be a bit cheeky… However Spain pulled the same trick in the semi-final and got away with it. Noting that match officials seem utterly non-plussed to these anticss and that Pickford needs to stay focused on the game, Dean Henderson comes over to keep the towel safe personally. Unpeturbed by this the ball boys and staff continue to play capture the flag with this towel and then, Spain’s subs start going tying in on the act.",
      "Then things get very surreal indeed as the balboys chase Henderson onto the pitch and basically attempt to mug him of this towel, resorting to dragging him by his ankles along the grass.",
      "The referees and tournament officials shrug and ignore what is now basically an assault on the goalkeeper.",
      "Of course you can’t imagine this because it simply would never have been allowed. Spain would never have contemplated going so far over the line, and no matter how corrupt UEFA are, they would have no choice but to end the game and throw the boom at Spain team and it’s FA.",
      "So you can imagine the feeling among the England camp and fans as the ref appears to be acting, let’s say, rather generous to the Spanish team in chalking off an England goal for the softest of not quite fouls expertly preventing VAR intervention, and then giving the Spanish team a soft penalty at the other end moments later?",
      "Could you at this point really feel too shocked and appalled when, let’s say Southgate calls his players off down the tunnel in disgust, eventuality giving in to Harry Kane’s insistence that we have to be professional? Would you still really not be at the point of cheering when Pickford, bullied all match, decides to put off Ferran Torres before the spot kick?",
      "And when somehow England win the match and lift the trophy against all odds and apparently the will of literally everyone else involved in this sham of a match, and as Southgate brings his daughter out to the presser, to be greeted by heckling Spanish reporters, could you truly blame him for adjusting the medal around his neck then walking off and giving two digits to all involved?",
      "What can you say about AFCON organisers when they allow a tournament to end with a match so farcical, you’d think it was the script for a WWE title match, with the only thing missing being the Moroccan manager distracting the ref whilst Hakimi delivers a steel chair to Mendy’s back?",

These were funny to read due to the absolute cringe and embarrassment that someone would write these actions in, with some worse than the fedora one talking about blushing and smiling nervously and saying “m’lady” when talking to a girl.",

      "There is a battle going on for several top strikers across Europe.",
      "Centre-forwards are wanted in every transfer window and always come at a premium, but this month several very good ones are on the market and some big clubs are circling.",
      "But do not rule out other clubs emerging either as it gets closer to the deadline, which is just 11 days away.",
      "Clubs interested: Juventus, Aston Villa",
      "Mateta has told Crystal Palace he wants to leave the club this month. He has wanted to leave since last summer when multiple clubs tried to sign him and he did not agree a new contract with Palace.",
      "The strongest team on him has been Juventus, but they have other options too such as Youssef En Nesyri. Aston Villa are also interested in Mateta but appear to be prioritising Tammy Abraham at Besiktas. Those two are not the only clubs.",
      "However, Crystal Palace are not actively trying to sell Mateta and it would require a significant offer for the club to be tempted to sell.",
      "They still value Mateta around £35m and, as things stand, an exit is not close. In the background is uncertainty around head coach Oliver Glasner and the club are trying to stabilise a rocky point in their season.",
      "So far, Juventus are prepared to pay around £26m (€30m) to sign him in a proposal that would involve an initial loan for £1.7m and then a £24.3m obligation to buy in the summer.",
      "Sky in Italy's Gianluca Di Marzio has reported Palace have rejected an initial offer from Juventus. The Serie A club are willing to offer Mateta a four-year deal too with a significant pay rise.",
      "Palace turned down bids for Mateta from Champions League clubs in the summer and there was also a late enquiry - but no bid - from Tottenham Hotspur before they signed Randal Kolo Muani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain on Deadline Day.",
      "Atalanta, AC Milan and several Premier League clubs were also interested in Mateta in the summer but a move did not happen.",
      "Since Glasner's first Premier League game in charge of Palace in February 2024, only Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah have scored more league goals than Mateta (35).",
      "At 28, he wants to play for a Champions League club or for a club who have a good chance of playing in the competition next season.",
      "He also wants to play for France in the World Cup after he was called up for the first time in October and he scored his first goal away at Iceland. But he faces tough competition for a place in a highly talented squad.",
      "Palace executive chairman Steve Parish is a notoriously tough negotiator, and he has always been reluctant to let any players leave on the cheap. And Palace want to strengthen their squad this month after selling Marc Guehi to Manchester City.",
      "They want to try and win the Conference League and finish as high as possible in the Premier League, keeping Glasner for the rest of his contract in the process.",
      "Club interested: Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa have been stepping up their efforts to sign Tammy Abraham after Villa officials and the player's representatives watched him play for Besiktas in Istanbul on Monday night. The club are currently in Turkey to play Fenerbahce on Thursday night.",
      "Villa want to strengthen their squad after selling Donyell Malen to Roma on January 16 but money remains tight at the club and they are conscious of ensuring they meet their PSR obligations.",
      "Villa's high wage bill relative to their revenue means they have to be careful when it comes to spending in the transfer market. UEFA fined Villa £9.5m in July last year for breaking their financial rules.",
      "It is believed Besiktas now own Abraham's registration after he met the criteria to join them permanently amid an initial loan deal from Roma - and he is believed to keen to return to Villa, whom he spent time on loan at from Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Abraham spent a hugely successful 2018-19 season on loan at Villa from Chelsea. He scored 26 times to help Villa win promotion back to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Other clubs - in the Premier League and in Europe - are also interested in Abraham this month and Villa now have injury problems in midfield, with John McGinn joining Boubakar Kamara on the sidelines.",
      "Villa have already been in for midfielders this month, missing out on signing Conor Gallagher to Tottenham Hotspur. They are also trying to find a solution for Harvey Elliott, whom they do not want to play any further to avoid having to sign him permanently from Liverpool for £35m.",
      "Clubs interested: Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham",
      "Leeds United are the latest of multiple clubs to make enquiries to Wolves for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "The 25-year-old, who is valued at £40m by the struggling bottom side, is also attracting interest from West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.",
      "Leeds are aware of the competition for Strand Larsen and have to be cautious with PSR in this transfer window. As things stand, they have simply expressed their interest in the player with Wolves.",
      "Departures could help Leeds to make room for incomings, and Jack Harrison has now joined Fiorentina. Joel Piroe could also leave in the next days. However, as things stand Leeds believe he wants to stay and fight for his place and the club will not push him out the door.",
      "Crystal Palace are believed to have made an enquiry too, and that is one to watch considering the growing uncertainty around Mateta's future at the club.",
      "Since their own Strand Larsen enquiry, West Ham have signed two new forwards in Pablo and Taty Castellanos, with Callum Wilson also increasingly likely to stay.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the other club to be keen on Strand Larsen but they appear to be focussing on Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli.",
      "Norway international Strand Larsen was the subject of intense interest from Newcastle in the summer, and since he has scored only three times for struggling Wolves this season, in 13 appearances, his value has depreciate somewhat.",
      "Wolves are weighing up what they can do in the market to make themselves more competitive but also protect the long-term, which may include a period in the Championship.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest",
      "Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired about Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor.",
      "No concrete approach has been made yet as both clubs are also considering or waiting on other targets, whom are on this list.",
      "The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and he is one to watch with 11 days left of this window.",
      "The 25-year-old's contract is up in 2028 and he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland behind Brian Brobbey and sometimes Eleizer Mayenda.",
      "Isidor has not been in a Premier League squad since New Year's Day and has not started two games in a row since November.",
      "Isidor has scored only four Premier League goals this season, and none since October.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Napoli, Sevilla",
      "Youssef En Nesyri impressed as Morocco reached the AFCON final and it has ramped up interest in him from a number of clubs across Europe.",
      "The Fenerbahce striker, known to Premier League clubs for some time after his impressive stint at Sevilla in Spain, is firmly on the radar of Nottingham Forest and Everton this month.",
      "There is competition from two Italian giants, however, in Juventus - exploring him as an alternative to Mateta - and Antonio Conte's Napoli, who are preparing to lose Lorenzo Lucca to Forest or elsewhere on loan.",
      "According to Sky in Italy, even former club Sevilla have made an inquiry about getting En Nesyri back to the club.",
      "Aston Villa play against Fenerbahce on Thursday night in the Europa League and although it is not clear how much they like En Nesyri themselves, a match-winning performance for the Turkish club would be hard to ignore if that is what he produces.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Besiktas, Benfica",
      "Nottingham Forest have agreed loan terms with Napoli for Lorenzo Lucca, according to Sky in Italy, but the striker has not given a final decision over his future and discussions continue.",
      "Pisa - his former club - are also interested in Lucca and have offered him a chance to stay in Italy so the situation remains in the balance and down to the player.",
      "Forest are therefore also working on other options, some mentioned above, and also including Evan Ferguson.",
      "Forest have made signing a striker a priority following an injury to Chris Wood and uncertainty over the progress of Arnaud Kalimuendo, who has gone to Germany on loan for his development.",
      "Lucca is a 25-year-old Italy international who is technically on loan at Napoli from Udinese. However, Napoli hold an obligation to buy him and so would execute that obligation before he would be able to move anywhere else.",
      "Therefore, if Forest do indeed loan him, it would be from Napoli and not Udinese.",
      "Club interested: Roma",
      "Roma will begin preparing a proposal for Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They have been waiting in the wings to move for the forward while United had Bryan Mbeumo away at AFCON and the change of head coach at Old Trafford needed time to conclude.",
      "However, against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge, Zirkzee was not even in the matchday squad. It was said he had a minor injury.",
      "A strong Roma advance will almost certainly test the resolve of both player and club if it comes.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Fulham",
      "With Roma aiming to make changes to their forward line, including potentially bringing in Zirkee from United, Evan Ferguson's situation on loan there is in doubt.",
      "Napoli and Forest are keeping an eye on the situation and the decision is down to Roma, with Brighton deputy chair Paul Barber confirming earlier in the window that they do not have the option to recall him.",
      "\"It's very unlikely, I would say (that he returns to Brighton),\" Barber said. \"We don't have that option, so if he were to come back it would be because the club that has him at the moment doesn't need him in the second half of the season.",
      "\"At the moment it seems very unlikely - he's playing well and scoring goals, it's not really one that is in our gift.\"",
      "Fulham have also long looked at Ferguson as a way of strengthening at centre-forward but their priority remains to sign PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi.",
      "If Ferguson's loan is terminated and he arrives back at Brighton, there is expected to be increased interest from other clubs in taking him on loan for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Although Roma are exploring changes, Ferguson has impressed there. He has scored five goals in 21 appearances including two in five games in the Europa League. It has been a positive step in his development so far, playing in Italy.",
      "Callum Wilson (West Ham), Joel Piroe (Leeds), David Datro Fofana (Chelsea/Fatih Karagümrük), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Artem Dovbyk (Roma)"

      "United's first goal against City on Saturday evoked something for those present at Old Trafford. You could not help but feel something.",
      "Instantly my mind went back to iconic goals scored against Arsenal. Whether that was in the Champions League second-leg in 2009 - led by Cristiano Ronaldo, Park-ji Sung and Wayne Rooney - or a year later in the Premier League where Nani and Rooney (again) led their own devastating counter-attacking display against the Gunners.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener was not just a classic counter-attacking goal. If you look at that second goal I just mentioned - it mirrored Rooney's lung-bursting run among five Arsenal players to receive the ball from Nani to score. Amad Diallo and Mbeumo showed the same urgency when Bruno Fernandes found himself in the perfect position to lead the counter.",
      "Context is then required. The weeks of tension and impatience building from the Old Trafford crowd after dour and frustrating performances against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month had led to most thinking: where was their next win going to come from?",
      "The Manchester derby was an impressive victory for Michael Carrick and his backroom staff, but there is also a hesitance to get too carried away. Despite that being the best 90 minute performance in years, this United team have shown they can deliver in one-off games.",
      "But I am already more curious as to how this team will perform in the games after Arsenal when Carrick's side face Fulham, Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "This is where we will find out whether they are in serious contention for a Champions League place.",
      "I said similar in November and December when they had a run of games against 'lower' positioned opposition and they failed to capitalise during that time which eventually led to Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "This is a second chance.",
      "It was quite clear watching some of United's training session this week and speaking to those around the club as they prepared for Arsenal that there have been some subtle changes.",
      "Carrick addressed the players at the start of the session, as Amorim would, but it was still intriguing to see how hands on Carrick was in his role as head coach as they began their drills. This was the first time we had a glimpse of training with our Sky cameras in attendance.",
      "From the open section we saw, watching Carrick, Jonathan Woodgate and Steve Holland run the session in unison was fascinating.",
      "Holland, in particular, made an impression - pushing and encouraging the players to maintain a high level. It sounds obvious but Holland's experience carried a certain authority that was notable from where we were standing.",
      "One change under Carrick and his backroom staff has been shortening the sessions while increasing the intensity within them. There has been a notable and positive reaction among the first team in response.",
      "Although we were not able to see this in the open part of the session, from what I understand another positive change has been the increase in individual work with different players in the squad.",
      "It was widely understood under Amorim, the team would spend a lot of time on the training ground walking through systems and formations they would set up in.",
      "Despite Amorim saying this time on the training ground would yield more positive results the more this side trained on the pitch, that did not happen. This is not a criticism of the Portuguese coach but whatever the team worked on, it did not lead to the consistency needed for him to succeed.",
      "The shorter but intense sessions coupled with an increased amount of time spent on individual work has led (albeit one game in) to a positive atmosphere being created under Carrick.",
      "But there is also important messaging from Carrick and his staff.",
      "As mentioned before, no one inside or outside Carrington will get carried away with one win against Manchester City because of the false starts under previous coaches.",
      "But as Carrick announced to the media during his first week in charge, he has told his players they should enjoy playing for the club and while not getting carried away, embrace the responsibility and privilege that comes with the shirt.",
      "Time will tell whether these changes will have a short-lived impact on the team or whether they will be the foundations of a successful second-half of the season for United.",
      "What is clear is that this coaching staff have made an impression on this group of players and after such a challenging 14 months under Amorim if they can start enjoying their football again then they may just find themselves in the Champions League next season.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 07:17, UK",
      "Manchester United have fallen to their lowest position in the Deloitte Football Money League, with Liverpool the highest-earning English club for the first time.",
      "The Red Devils were once regarded as the blueprint for commercial success in football and have topped the Money League in 10 of its 29 editions, most recently in 2017.",
      "However, United are down in eighth in the 2026 table, in part due to broadcast revenue dropping from €258m [£216.72m] to €206m [£172.9m] because of their absence from the Champions League in 2024-25.",
      "The club are set to generate even less matchday revenue in the current season due to their total absence from European competition, and their failure to go past the first hurdle in either domestic cup means they will play only 20 competitive fixtures at Old Trafford in 2025-26.",
      "\"The clubs with the biggest football club brands and position in the market have an opportunity to broaden their reach and offer more to fans on a matchday, offer more to fans on a non-matchday, and become a more 365-days-a-year touch point,\" said Tim Bridge, the Sports Business Group Leader at Deloitte. \"United are probably only just starting that journey now, because of the reported stadium development.",
      "\"If you went back 10 or 15 years, and you looked at Manchester United's matchday revenue it was the industry leader. If you looked at their ability to generate commercial revenue, it was the benchmark by which everybody then went to market and set their strategy. I don't think that remains the case.",
      "\"The opportunity remains for Manchester United. They are arguably still the biggest global football club brand, and therefore they have the opportunity to maximise that in a way that is only possible for a select few.",
      "\"But to do that requires fit-for-purpose facilities. As the industry evolves, clubs should ask themselves whether there is a need to rethink how they engage with fans and how that relationship works. With reports of the new stadium, it is clear they have started to do some of that, so it's very clear they're thinking in that way. Their timing of making that change is behind Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the opportunity remains.\"",
      "United are the fourth-placed English club in the 2026 Money League behind Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal, with Real Madrid top as they became the first team to record revenue over €1bn - €1.161bn or £975.2m.",
      "Liverpool sit fifth after their return to the Champions League in 2024-25 and a seven per cent increase in commercial revenue from non-matchday events at Anfield.",
      "It is the first time there has not been an English team in the Money League top four, with Real, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain all benefiting from going deep in the newly expanded Champions League and the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the summer.",
      "Deloitte said that the Club World Cup had resulted in a 17 per cent average uplift in broadcast revenues for the 10 Money League clubs who had been involved.",
      "Premier League teams may expect to fare better generally in the 2027 Money League, which will be the first to reflect the new broadcast deal which runs to 2029, but Bridge said the best-performing clubs would continue to be those who match on-field success with diversification off it.",
      "\"The trick to staying [in the top five] is maintaining both of those. It used to be you only had to maintain one of them. Now, in 2026, we're at a point where the highest revenue generating clubs are probably broader than football,\" he said.",
      "Manchester City's sixth place was their lowest since the Covid-19-impacted season of 2019-20.",
      "In all, nine Premier League clubs made it into the top 20 of the Money League, with Tottenham [ninth], Chelsea [10th], Aston Villa [14th], Newcastle [17th] and West Ham [20th].",
      "For a fourth year, the Deloitte Football Money League profiles 15 of the top revenue generating women's clubs globally. In another record-breaking year, these clubs reported average revenues in excess of €10m [£8.4m] for the first time, with cumulative revenues of €158m [£132.72m], marking an increase of 35 per cent on last year's total.",
      "Arsenal Women tops the list this year, dethroning FC Barcelona Femení for the first time, with revenues of €25.6m [£21.5m], an increase of 43 per cent from the previous season. Significant investment into fan data and activation helped garner attendances exceeding 35,000 on five separate occasions across the 2024/25 season.",
      "Chelsea Women ranks in a close second [£21.3m] while generating the highest commercial revenue among the top 15 [£16m]. FC Barcelona Femení [£18.5m] completes the top three after another successful domestic season.",
      "\"While growth has developed significantly in women's football in recent years, the shift from the start up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment, and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner,\" said Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in the Deloitte Sports Business Group.",
      "\"As further milestones are hit, including new and expanded competitions on the biggest stages, industry leaders must continue to innovate, while also protecting the wants and needs of fans and players to foster a more sustainable future for the game.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in Manchester derby was worthy of a red card according to PGMOL chief Howard Webb; But VAR was right not to intervene in 10th-minute incident that saw the Man Utd defender only shown a yellow",
      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 15:48, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb is unconvinced that Diogo Dalot’s challenge on Jeremy Doku in Man Utd’s 2-0 win over Man City was worthy of a red card - but is convinced that VAR was right not to intervene.",
      "Dalot escaped a red card for a 10th-minute tackle on Doku, which ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean believed was \"100 per cent\" a sending off.",
      "The Man Utd defender was only shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor, with VAR Craig Pawson backing the on-field decision.",
      "Analysing the decision on Mic'd Up, Webb said: \"Is there excessive force? Some will say, yes. I'm not quite there, but I can see that there could be.",
      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's one where the referee's call should stand on the field. That's what we've said we'll do where there's a mix of considerations.",
      "\"I think there is a mix, and therefore in this situation, it was right to leave it as the referee's call.",
      "\"If a red had been given, I would have expected the red card to stand as well, in the same way.\"",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola felt Dalot should have been sent off after an early foul on Jeremy Doku.",
      "But VAR Pawson stood by Taylor's on-field decision, believing the contact was \"glancing and not with force\".",
      "Webb said: \"At full speed, when you play it in real time, you can see there's not a great deal of speed in the action, not a lot of intensity.",
      "\"We were heavily criticised a few years ago for using slow motion and freeze frames because people said, this is not reality. It's not how the game is played. When you slow it down, it can look a lot worse - and it does. When you freeze frame it, you can make a lot of situations look like red card offences.",
      "\"So it's difficult for me to hear people make a judgment on this just by analysing freeze frame and slow motion, coming to the consideration that it's red on that basis.",
      "\"Yes, it could be red, but you have to think about the need to look at it at full speed. We've done that for some time now. We thought it was a fair criticism some time ago when people said, 'Stop using slow-mos as the main way of analysing these situations'. And we've listened, and we agree. And we play it at full speed. Then we slow it down a little bit to see the exact point of contact to factor that in as well.",
      "\"But without speed and force and intensity, it's unlikely to be a red card.\"",
      "Speaking at half-time at Old Trafford, Keane said: \"Doku definitely helps him [by not staying down]. I'm no expert on red cards, but I think it's a red.\"",
      "Richards said: \"He [Dalot] is on top of his knee. That is as clear a red card as you are going to see. What more do you want?!\"",
      "Ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher speaking on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I thought it was a red card.",
      "\"He's gone in high and with a straight leg. He's hit him with his studs on the knee. The ball is not there, it's gone, so for me, it's a red card but for others, it is not.\"",
      "Former Cardiff and England striker Jay Bothroyd agreed with Gallafger on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I can't believe Dalot has tried to appeal the yellow card. It's a terrible challenge.",
      "\"The priority for the referees is player safety. When you see challenges like that, Doku could have ended up really hurt.",
      "\"To me, it wasn't a glancing blow. His studs are up and it is above the ankle. I don't understand how it is not a red card.",
      "\"It's a terrible decision. That's going to be one of the worst decisions of the season.\"",
      "On Mic'd Up, the full transcript between referee Taylor, VAR Pawson and assistant VAR, Adrian Holmes, was released and showed how the officials concluded staying with Taylor's on-field yellow card decision...",
      "Ref: \"I'm going yellow card, it's a glance.\"",
      "VAR: \"Yeah, he does, he's glancing contact on the knee. There's no force, but there is glancing contact. He's tried to play the ball, and he catches it with glancing contact. Glancing contact, there's no force. He's tried to play the ball, he flicks, he misses the ball, he catches him with a follow-through. I'm happy to confirm the on-field decision.\"",
      "AVAR: \"How fast does he come in?\"",
      "VAR: \"He doesn't, he kind of slows into it.\"",
      "AVAR: \"He checks his step, doesn't he?\"",
      "VAR: \"Yeah. Tayls [Anthony Taylor] confirming the yellow card for Manchester United 2 [Diogo Dalot]. He tries to play the ball, he misses it, and then he makes glancing contact onto the knee. There's no force or intensity, but he does catch him with a follow-through.\"",

      "\"He's gone into the England squad, and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him.",
      "\"He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "Current role: Paris Saint-Germain",
      "What Carragher said: \"You would absolutely have him all day. Now we see him as the best manager in Europe. He didn't have a good time at Celta Vigo, he didn't have a good time at Roma, but Barcelona still appointed him.\"",
      "Current role: Newcastle United",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",
      "Current role: Germany",
      "What Carragher said: \"I don't know everything about him but I do look at a coach with a big reputation, with a lot to prove in some ways.\"",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm crossing out Michael Carrick. I go back to this question - do I believe this guy can win the league? I have to believe he can. I don't believe Man Utd will win the league with Carrick, or Chelsea will with Liam Rosenior. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you have to be special. I might be proven wrong.\"",
      "Carragher also highlighted why other candidates, such as Xabi Alonso, Diego Simeone and Oliver Glasner, aren't suitable for the role.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp will not be managing Manchester United. That is out. Xabi Alonso - he cannot do that. He can't, his affiliation with Liverpool. That can't happen.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti, for me, wouldn't have the energy or drive to get Man Utd back. Zinedine Zidane is a younger version of [Carlo] Ancelotti, but maybe I am wrong. Enzo Maresca is a no, but he is a really good coach.",
      "\"Xavi is one, at Barcelona, he won the league but enough experience for Manchester United? He only has a couple of years of experience as a manager.",
      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",
      "\"He'd have to do something really special. Mauricio Pochettino is the same as Ancelotti. Chelsea went with Enzo Maresca as they wanted a young and energetic coach.",
      "Oliver Glasner, straight away, I'd say no because of the system. Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job and is linked with top jobs but Bournemouth to Man Utd is a big jump.",
      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",

      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at Paul Scholes and invited him to his house for talks after the former Man Utd midfielder criticised the defender ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see [them] here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "\"So I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.\"",
      "Asked if such comments give him extra motivation, Martinez said: \"No, no, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Scholes, having seen the interview from Martinez, posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you. Tea, no sugar please…@lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Martinez said things at United were \"so different\" in the build-up to the win against City, with Michael Carrick taking charge of the team until the end of the season, following Darren Fletcher's brief interim spell in the hotseat after Ruben Amorim's exit.",
      "Asked if much had changed since Carrick took over on Wednesday, Martinez said: \"So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy.",
      "\"He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.\"",
      "Martinez said \"the team today was different\", pointedly adding: \"When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "The 28-year-old highlighted the new head coach's quiet confidence and the relentless backing from supporters.",
      "\"I feel amazing,\" Martinez said. \"I think we deserve to win this game.",
      "\"We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy today.",
      "\"It's about the connection [with the fans], it's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",
      "\"But if sometimes our performance wasn't the best because they expect from us good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United.",
      "\"And I can really understand because sometimes it's like 'what are we doing here?' And today, that is the standard for this club.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "\"Let's judge it over the next few months. The key for him is trying to get momentum in the team. He is an English coach, the English media will be pushing for him. He has done well today, but let's see how he does.",
      "\"They've won one game! The last manager won one game. He's only been there three days.",
      "\"Darren Fletcher changed the formation, but there were players missing. Michael Carrick has come in to the dream scenario. Everyone is available, City at home, they've been a little bit off it, he could have had a man sent off.",
      "\"Timing and a bit of luck, they have made the most of it. Take nothing away from him - but everyone just calm down.\"",

      "Nicky Butt on Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez's reaction to criticism ahead of the Manchester derby: \"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house'... grow up\"",
      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 01:14, UK",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have continued their war of words with Manchester United's Lisandro Martinez, with Butt telling the Argentine to \"grow up\" over his response to criticism.",
      "After playing his part in United's 2-0 win over City at Old Trafford, Martinez challenged Scholes to speak to him face-to-face after he and Nicky Butt had mocked the defender's size before his battle with Erling Haaland, suggesting the Norwegian would \"pick him up and run with him\".",
      "Scholes said he had previously exchanged messages with Martinez on social media and given the player his phone number but had \"not heard anything\".",
      "But responding directly to Martinez's comments on the latest edition of his The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Scholes' joint-host and former team-mate Butt said: \"It's tongue-in-cheek, it's obvious Haaland isn't actually going to pick him up and run with him, it's a figure of speech,\" he said.",
      "\"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house', f****** grow up.",
      "\"Literally, if you're going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you, you shouldn't be at a big football club because you'll get that for the rest of your career at Man United.",
      "\"I got so much crap when I played at United and Newcastle, but the next week you get plaudits and clapped at. There's no personal issue with us and Martinez, none.\"",
      "Scholes praised Martinez's display but said he still has some doubts about the 28-year-old.",
      "\"It fuels people,\" he said of criticism. \"I think we have to take a bit of the credit for Martinez's performance on Saturday!\"",
      "But he then warned: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.",
      "\"I haven't changed my opinion yet. I'm still not sure you can win a league with him. He's got to do it over a period of time. What he did on Saturday, brilliant, but you've got to do it over a period of time.\"",
      "Butt said Martinez's reaction to their comments raised questions about his mentality.",
      "Butt pointed to the experience that he and the rest of United's 'Class of 92' had when Alan Hansen famously said on Match of the Day \"you can't win anything with kids\". A teenager at the time, Butt said that taught him to deal with criticism.",
      "\"I was 18, not 26 or 27,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go out of the house for weeks, but you man up and go and prove people wrong.\"",

      "With Bruno Fernandes the first man to create so many big chances against Pep Guardiola's Man City, Adam Bate looks at why Man Utd's playmaker needs to be in his best position. Also in The Debrief: Florentino's tackling and Newcastle's predictability",
      "Monday 19 January 2026 09:25, UK",
      "",
      "Manchester United's thrilling performance in their derby win over Manchester City on Saturday has naturally sparked talk of them being back, a restoration of sorts after Ruben Amorim's exit. That remains to be seen but for Bruno Fernandes it seems clearer.",
      "Back in his best position, restored to that No 10 role, he produced some performance at Old Trafford. Having been denied a goal and an assist by the offside flag in the first half, he eventually set up the opener - and made history against Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "In his decade in charge, no player had ever created four big chances in a Premier League game against them. In fact, Fernandes is the only player to do it against any team this season. And he has done it twice, having also achieved it in beating Wolves last month.",
      "Fernandes is responsible for three of the four occasions that a player has created four big chances in a Premier League game in the past three seasons, a reminder that while sometimes cast as part of the problem, he is surely among the victims of United's malaise.",
      "His efforts against City saw him bring up 600 chances created in his Premier League career, which is 168 more than Kevin De Bruyne, who is the next person on the list, since Fernandes' debut in the competition. Astonishing in what has often been an underwhelming side.",
      "Those numbers also indicate that he has not exactly been stifled under Amorim. In fact, he tops the charts for chances created this season too. Even so, it must make sense to get Fernandes closer to the opposition goal where he can do more damage from open play.",
      "The heatmaps from his Premier League career at United show that he was doing more of his work in his own half under Amorim, whose preferred formation does not have a natural role for a true No 10. Michael Carrick must be tempted to unleash him from there now.",
      "Because he can still make the difference. United's owners will look to Fernandes' age and the potential money that is on offer from Saudi Arabia and make their calculations. But there is also Champions League money to consider. And this Fernandes can deliver that.",
      "Florentino's performance in Burnley's surprise 1-1 draw at Liverpool did not showcase the same levels of creativity but he deserves huge credit for his attempts to shut down the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield. The midfielder made nine tackles.",
      "It is only the fifth time that a player has made nine tackles in a Premier League game this season - and Florentino has been responsible for two of them, having also done so against West Ham in November. This was perhaps his best game in a Burnley shirt.",
      "It was not perfect. He gave away a penalty that Dominik Szoboszlai missed. And some fans have been a little frustrated by his lack of care in possession. But his combative qualities were ideally suited to this particular challenge against Arne Slot's side.",
      "Perhaps Newcastle's goalless draw at Wolves should not have come as a surprise given that they started the season with three stalemates in their first three Premier League matches on the road. But it is just another example of their lack of cutting edge.",
      "Eddie Howe's side have now failed to score in three of their last four away from home. In fact, their only two Premier League victories on their travels have come after taking the lead inside two minutes. When charged with breaking teams down, they often struggle.",
      "Nick Woltemade has become something of a scapegoat for that, having not scored in his last seven appearances. But Newcastle's creativity problems run deeper. They are too passive in attack for a team that is at his best when showing real intensity in their play.",
      "Indeed, at Molineux they became the team to have registered the highest passing accuracy without a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta began collecting such records. Wolves dropped deep. All Newcastle could do was cross the ball.",
      "Where was the movement inside, the movement around Woltemade? Wolves were happy to let Newcastle have the ball wide. Better chances might have come with some cute play in the half spaces. Without it, Howe's team can look a little one-dimensional.",

      "\"It has always been about the same thing, the love of it, just that feeling of being a football player, on the pitch, running after a ball. Obviously, you want to win and play in the best possible teams you can. But I think that love of football never leaves you.\"",
      "His new team Wolfsburg are not exactly flying in the Bundesliga. Earlier this month, they lost 8-1 to Bayern Munich. \"Not nice at all.\" But Eriksen scored as they bounced back with a win over St Pauli. \"We had a lot of stuff we had to prove to ourselves,\" he says.",
      "He also provided the cross for the late equaliser against Heidenheim at the weekend. Watching him up close on a bitterly cold day at the Volkswagen Arena, fans of the midfield maestro can rest assured that, even at the age of 33, the old Eriksen magic remains.",
      "His five chances created in the game were as many as his team-mates managed between them and included one lovely ball over the top that should have brought the opening goal. Playing off the right, he drops deep, floats around, has freedom to roam.",
      "In his pomp at Tottenham, Eriksen did all that and more and was arguably the Premier League's outstanding creative force. A big claim but the numbers support that. During his Spurs career nobody provided more assists or created more chances than the Dane.",
      "He also scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player in that time. Wolfsburg fans have not seen one yet but this Rolls-Royce of a player feels at home in Volkswagen country. \"I just had a gut feeling it would suit me,\" he explains.",
      "\"I could see myself playing for Wolfsburg, trying the Bundesliga. It is a very open league. One team can be 3-0 up in the last 10 minutes and it can still end up 3-3. There is a lot going on and every team wants to play a little bit. It is an exciting league to watch and to play in.\"",
      "Remarkably, the Heidenheim game came 16 years to the day since Eriksen made his professional debut for Ajax. \"Has it been 16 years since my debut? I have had a fun 16 years,\" he says. \"It is still fun.\" But the hair is thinning and those team-mates are getting younger.",
      "\"All the new players coming up, they are born in the 2000s, even the late 2000s. That is weird,\" he says, smiling a little, amusing himself at the thought. \"I am around such young kids. At the same time, although in football terms I am obviously very old, I do not feel old.\"",
      "So, how exactly has football changed over these past 16 years, then? Where to begin. \"It has gone through different stages in terms of possession, then a bit of tactical work, then about possession again, then a lot of pressing, then a lot of athleticism,\" he explains.",
      "\"Now, there are a lot of stats going around, a lot of numbers you have got to hit, so there is a lot more time spent looking at the computer. You have to hit a certain amount of kilometres in training just to make sure you are in the right place for the next game.",
      "\"Years ago, that was not there. It was just on a hunch. Do you feel good? Okay, you are ready to go. Now, everything else is taken into consideration. What is your load? How many high-speed runs do you need to do? How many extra sprints do you need to do?\"",
      "He sounds a little bemused. \"Even strikers now are the first guys to press. Double runs, triple runs.\" But he has been able to adapt. And he has done so having come through that moment nobody will ever be able to forget at the European Championship in 2021.",
      "He almost lost more than his career that day in Copenhagen but recovered to add more chapters to his football story. Brentford offered a route back before he spent three seasons at Manchester United. But there was no role for him under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"As a player, I did not feel he was going to look my way, in every sense. Of course, then you struggle a bit football-wise. But person-wise, we had a decent relationship, nothing wrong there. He has one idea. Maybe I was a style of player not really suited for him.\"",
      "He insists that he wants the best for the club and believes \"a new manager brings new ideas\" and sees it as a \"chance for everyone\" again. Kobbie Mainoo, especially? \"I hope for anyone, it does not matter if it is Kobbie or someone else. I hope the club has success.\"",
      "Eriksen is well placed to assess the issues at Spurs too, having played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Is he surprised to see Frank's struggles? \"Yes and no,\" he says. \"I mean, the pressure is bigger. Of course, Brentford for a long time was a safe place.\"",
      "He adds: \"Now, he is in a new place with new eyes and people want something else. I hope he gets the time to change it and see what he can do. But I know football moves quickly and there are a lot of new ideas this week and then next week it will be another idea.\"",
      "If Eriksen sounds like he has seen it all in football, one wonders what is left for him. The World Cup playoffs in March are on his mind. \"The chance to play at the World Cup would be special. That is the first aim and to hopefully have a big tournament after,\" he says.",
      "His contract at Wolfsburg has another season to run after this and he is determined to see an improvement. \"We have lost way too many games this season. But we are on a better run now than we were before.\" As for the personal goals, well, they never change.",
      "\"Just to keep improving and just to have fun on a football pitch. I mean, that is what I have been doing for so many years,\" But does he cherish all this a bit more after what he has been through? \"I think I am just enjoying the moment, as I was before,\" he adds.",
      "\"But at the same time, I know what you can lose. So, I am happy with what I have. Maybe I am not cherishing it more but I am just enjoying what is ahead.\" What is certain is that we should cherish every opportunity we get to see Christian Eriksen playing football.",
