      "Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey has branded the statement explaining the decision to not send off Nathan Collins as ‘absolute nonsense’.",
      "The Brentford defender avoided getting his marching orders after conceding a penalty during their 3-1 win over Manchester United. With the Bees leading 2-1, Collins was penalised for pulling back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to connect with the ball.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot, but decided against showing Collins a red card. That was despite the United striker being poised to fire a shot at goal from close distance.",
      "The VAR on duty backed up Pawson’s decision, with Bruno Fernandes missing from the spot to add further insult to injury. A statement from the Premier League Match Centre explained the decision with a statement released swiftly after the penalty was awarded.",
      "That statement read: \"The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to have pulled Mbeumo back.",
      "\"VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",
      "However, Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for more than 10 years, slammed the decision - and subsequent explanation, suggesting the correct call was cut and dry.",
      "Halsey told the Sun: “The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball.It doesn’t say in law about having the ball under control.",
      "“It’s about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball. “In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "“Manchester United will be very disappointed with that decision. A red card should have been shown to the Brentford player.”",
      "Defeat at the GTech was United’s third in just six league matches, leaving them marooned in the bottom half. It also continued Ruben Amorim’s long run of being unable to win back to back Premier League matches.",
      "Amorim refused to openly criticise the decision, instead lamenting his side’s inability to control the game. “We have the ability and the capacity to control the game, to calm down the game. We didn't do that today,” he explained.",
      "“You guys have the ability to make your decision with your opinion of the decision. The referee told me that Bryan [Mbeumo] was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled. So that was the decision.",
      "“Again, I want - especially in these kind of moments - not to focus on the referee. What we should have done this afternoon is play better, and we need to play better.\"",
      "Despite another chastening defeat, the Portuguese boss remains confident that he will be able to turn it around He added: \"It’s like ups and downs. When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum is there.",
      "“When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "“Guys, I'm always doing my job. If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal. I'm always confident because I know what to do.\"",

      "Ex-France star Emmanuel Petit has previously suggested that Zinedine Zidane would require certain conditions to be fulfilled before he'd consider taking the reins at Manchester United. The Champions League-winning gaffer's name has been thrown into the hat as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim, as the pressure continues to mount.",
      "United were unable to secure consecutive victories, failing to capitalise on their recent win over Chelsea, with Brentford emerging as 3-1 victors on Saturday. A brace from Igor Thiago in the first half left the visitors with a steep hill to climb after a sluggish start in west London.",
      "Benjamin Sesko managed to claw one back, scoring his debut goal for the club, before Bruno Fernandes missed a prime chance to equalise from the penalty spot with just 15 minutes remaining.",
      "Mathias Jensen sealed the deal deep into injury time, adding to the woes of the travelling United fans.",
      "The defeat leaves United languishing in 14th place with seven points, as Keith Andrews' squad leapfrogged them following their victory.",
      "Amorim is still facing rumours about his future at the club after failing to rectify their inconsistent and subpar performances. This has led to speculation linking Zidane to the role, but if a decision is made, they'll need to lure the former Real Madrid boss out of his hiatus.",
      "Zidane hasn't been seen in the dugout since 2021 after parting ways with Los Blancos for the second time. According to Petit, one of his ex-teammates, certain demands will need to be met for this to happen.",
      "\"At the moment, the environment at Manchester United for years has not been good. The stability of the bench, the level of the players as well, the expectation of the club is not the same that it used to be.",
      "\"United is still a huge club, but not on the pitch anymore. And Zizou is very conscious and very careful about that, the quality of the players.\"",
      "He added: \"Could he manage to overturn the situation over there? I think the only answer is yes. But at the moment, when you look at the team, I'm not convinced at all about the level of some players.",
      "Who'll win the Premier League title? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"So if I am Zizou, I think it will be very easy, actually, to answer this question [of joining United]. If I don't speak English on top of it, that will be more problems in terms of communication in the dressing room.",
      "\"If he takes the job at Manchester United, that means he's got solutions. At the moment, I'm not sure a lot of people have the solution to turn the situation at Manchester United.",
      "\"Does he want to leave the sunny days of Madrid? His life is in Madrid, he is dedicated to Madrid.",
      "\"I'm not sure that he speaks very good English as well. And communication is very important in the dressing room.\"",

      "A Wrexham legend once found himself struggling with debt until Gary Speed came to his aid. Former Welsh winger Mickey Thomas graced some of football's biggest stages during his prime, turning out for Manchester United and Chelsea alongside two stints with the North Wales club.",
      "But he plunged into serious financial trouble after squandering an estimated £500,000 through gambling. Thomas, who was raised in Mochdre, North Wales, previously revealed how he battled a severe gambling addiction that began after departing Wrexham for United in 1978.",
      "He confessed he had \"lost a fortune\" due to his compulsion, which persisted long after hanging up his boots in the mid-1990s.",
      "In his autobiography, published in 2008, he reflected on his addiction, saying: \"Most of the time it's boredom. More often than not it's a release of pressure. In extreme gambling cases like mine you always think you are in control – you never are.",
      "\"I've lost a fortune over the years. Maybe it's £250,000. Maybe it's more like £500,000. Thinking back, that's probably nearer the mark and I'm not proud to admit that. It was easy money. Easy to blow £10,000 on a spin of a roulette ball or the flick of a card.",
      "\"It's an addiction which grabbed me at United but it's one that has grabbed me more in my later years when I retired.\"",
      "Fortunately, the Red Dragons legend, who netted a memorable free-kick that helped Wrexham eliminate Arsenal from the FA Cup in 1992, managed to rebuild his life afterwards. Thomas, who represented Wales 51 times throughout his playing days, revealed it was partly down to his former Leeds colleague Speed's kindness that enabled him to begin settling the substantial debts he had accumulated.",
      "Reflecting several years following the ex-Wales boss's passing in 2011, he said: \"He was such a great bloke. After I hit hard times financially later in life, if he saw me he would always ask if I was all right for money. One day, I went to his house when he was with Newcastle United and he asked me if I wanted any boots.",
      "\"It was up to me what I did with them, maybe sell them to make a few quid to ease the debts. I ended up coming out of his garage with around 30 pairs. That's how generous he was. I will never forget his kindness.\"",
      "Thomas subsequently faced another ordeal following his cancer diagnosis in February 2019 when medics discovered a substantial tumour in his oesophagus. The growth was surgically removed in May that year, though he initially found the follow-up chemotherapy treatment challenging.",
      "He revealed he had received the cancer all-clear in November 2021 and has since campaigned to raise money for the department at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where NHS medics carried out life-saving treatment on him. The 71-year-old remains a familiar face at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground where supporters continue to adore him.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Wrexham's Hollywood owners, Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, also honoured Thomas after the club's promotion from League One in April this year. The pair invited him to their box to witness Wrexham secure their third consecutive promotion in style with a resounding 3-0 victory over Charlton Athletic.",
      "Post-match, Deadpool actor Reynolds shared his ambitions for the club: \"Our goal is to make it to the Premier League. It just seemed like an impossible dream, but as storytellers, you look as much as you can at the macro view of history.",
      "\"Without it I would not be here. You can go all the way back from the Gresford Disaster to Mickey Thomas, who is a huge point of aspiration for this club. And the goal was to reach that feeling – and it is a feeling.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",

      "Ben Foster has revealed the moment Sir Alex Ferguson delivered the crushing news that his Manchester United career was over. But he also explained why he still has nothing but admiration for his former boss despite the heartbreak.",
      "The shot-stopper arrived at United from Stoke City in 2005 after catching the eye of the legendary Scottish manager during a loan spell at Wrexham. He found it tough to establish himself in the first team throughout his Old Trafford tenure, with the reliable Edwin van der Sar firmly established as the club's number one.",
      "The former England goalkeeper went on to claim the League Cup on two occasions with United, though his Premier League outings remained limited. It was an unconvincing display during a heated Manchester derby clash in the top flight in September 2009 that marked the start of his downfall at the club.",
      "Foster was selected by Sir Alex to deputise for the injured Van der Sar in an enthralling 4-3 triumph over Man City, with Michael Owen netting a sensational stoppage-time winner at Old Trafford.",
      "However, a crucial error from the keeper resulted in him facing his manager's notorious \"hairdryer\" treatment once the final whistle had blown. Reflecting on the incident during the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, Foster revealed: \"I had an absolute stinker and I knew the writing was on the wall. I heard the manager saying something, because they had a telly in the changing rooms at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He was watching the replays, and I'm next to him thinking, 'Oh god, someone turn this telly off. This is s***.' He's watching it, and he's said to somebody, 'God, he needs to come out.' I knew he was talking about me and lo and behold, I was out the next week.",
      "\"He would tell you exactly where you stood, but I loved that about him. He was like, 'Listen, I can see that your confidence has gone so I'm taking you out of the team. I'm going to put Tomasz Kuszczak in for a bit, and then Edwin's back in a couple of weeks anyway.'\".",
      "Despite his blunder, Foster found himself back between the sticks for United's Premier League encounter with Sunderland at Old Trafford the following month. Another howler from the goalkeeper allowed Kenwyne Jones to find the net during the 2-2 stalemate.",
      "That crucial moment didn't merely cost him his spot in the squad - it effectively sealed his final top-flight outing for United. Yet reflecting on those dark days, Foster admitted he valued Sir Alex's brutal honesty, whilst departing the club actually kickstarted his career properly.",
      "He explained: \"Big Kenwyne Jones was up front for them, and the ball came into the box. I'd gone to punch it, but he headed it first and scored, and he left me on the floor in a heap. I'm like, 'Oh God'.",
      "\"Again, Patrice Evra scored a last minute goal which rescued me a bit, but the manager was fuming. I remember going into the changing rooms at full-time and then that was the hair dryer.",
      "\"He said, 'You're never playing for this club again', but it was in front of all the lads as well. I just remember thinking, 'Oh, this is horrible. I don't need this.' That was it in my head that I was done, and I was.",
      "\"At the time, it was horrible but I left at the end of that season and signed for Birmingham. That, for me, is when my career really started.\"",
      "Following his departure from Old Trafford at the conclusion of the 2009-10 campaign, Foster moved to Birmingham City, where he established himself as the club's number one keeper, securing a third League Cup triumph with the Blues in 2011.",
      "His stellar displays earned him a switch to West Bromwich Albion in 2012, where he continued his excellent form. Foster, who earned eight England caps throughout his career, subsequently enjoyed a four-year stint at Watford before concluding his playing days back at Wrexham, helping them secure National League glory in 2023.",
      "He now presents his own podcast, dubbed Fozcast, where he chats about football with various guests.",

      "Former Manchester United right-back Richard Eckersley will always remember January 24, 2009.",
      "It was the day he fulfilled his childhood dream of making his first-team debut for the club he joined at just nine years old. Coming off the bench at Old Trafford, Eckersley replaced Fabio in a thrilling FA Cup fourth round tie against Tottenham Hotspur, with United leading 2-1.",
      "At a time when the squad was brimming with big names, Eckersley was pushing for a spot in the first team. He drew inspiration from the commitment, dedication and desire of the club's leading stars.",
      "He recalled: \"You hear stories about them when you're growing up and coming through the academy. You heard about Roy Keane, Giggs, Scholes and their professionalism. You hear in the academy that this is what these players are like and how they got to that stage. It was really inspiring and, for the most part, all the things that I learnt there I have taken into my life now.\"",
      "Eckersley, now 36, made just four first-team outings but does possess a League Cup winners' medal from his Old Trafford days. Despite failing to feature for a single minute during the Reds' march to the 2009 final, he was among the substitutes at Wembley after impressing Sir Alex Ferguson in a reserve clash against Manchester City a few days earlier.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson used to watch all the reserve games and obviously contacted all the coaches,\" said Eckersley. \"I was playing really well in the reserves, and I think we played Manchester City in a reserve game a few days before the League Cup final, and I played really well.",
      "\"I think he just put me on the bench almost as a reward. I guess he was seeing it as an opportunity for me to get some time with the first team and potentially win something.",
      "\"Also, the confidence in me after seeing me play and the confidence in me to say, 'I can put you on the bench.' It was a surreal moment, and I do have a League Cup medal; I think it is in the loft at the minute. Actually, I have not looked at it for a while!\"",
      "Despite remaining an unused substitute, it represented the high point of Eckersley's United journey. Later that year, he chose to leave Old Trafford for newly-promoted Burnley.",
      "It was a choice he would come to rue, as he featured just twice for the Clarets and was sent out on various loan moves. He reflected: \"I think the decision to leave United was probably too early for me.",
      "\"I think I probably should have stayed on and developed at Carrington under the coaches that I was already working with, because I was making steady progress.",
      "\"I think the jump from the cusp of one of the world's greatest teams, you could say at that time, to Burnley, who had just got promoted but were going to be a struggling team in the Premier League, was a massive jump and a massive education for me, in terms of what is men's football and what is it like to play with players that haven't had the pedigree that people at United had.",
      "\"It was a huge shift from where I was at United and the standards that we were setting with professionalism, the facilities and all the kinds of things that we had. You were basically looked after to the nth degree. Then going somewhere like Burnley - and no disrespect to Burnley - they were just in a different headspace.",
      "\"It was just a completely different experience and, in hindsight, I think it would have been sensible for me to stay on [at United].\"",
      "Following loan spells at Plymouth Argyle, Bradford City and Bury, Eckersley headed to the MLS in April 2011, signing for Toronto FC. He said: \"I was desperate just to play and desperate to enjoy football, because at the time I wasn't enjoying football. I was playing in League Two, going on loan to Bradford, Bury, places like that.",
      "\"I went on loan to Plymouth and we were in a bit of a relegation battle. I played under a manager called Paul Mariner, who really liked me and really liked how I played. He got the general manager's job at Toronto, and that is how the move came about to North America.",
      "\"He said come over to the MLS, play for six or seven months on loan and enjoy the football. That is exactly what I did. He took me over and I loved it.",
      "\"I loved living by myself, I loved the culture, I loved the relaxation around football and people just enjoying the football. Don't get me wrong, the football was a very physical league, going here, there and everywhere, but I just felt that it was such an enjoyable time for me as a player, to enjoy just focusing on football and also off the pitch as well, learning to live by myself and on my own.",
      "\"I had a close-knit bond with my team-mates and it was a really enjoyable time. From there, I just wanted to stay and that was how it triggered.\"",
      "Eckersley stayed at Toronto for just under three years, featuring 92 times for the club. His next move kept him in the MLS, with New York Red Bulls snapping him up in January 2014, although he left less than a year later.",
      "He was keen to reignite his career back in England and had trials with Swindon Town and Southend United before signing for Oldham Athletic. Looking back on that spell, he said: \"I came back [to England] in January [2015] and for the first few weeks, nothing came about. I was waiting, waiting and waiting and nothing was available.",
      "\"I ended up signing for Oldham but I didn't enjoy my time there. By that time, I think I realised that I didn't really want to play football anymore. I was on the way out and I wasn't enjoying playing.\"",
      "At 26, while crossing the Irish Sea on a ferry from the Isle of Man, Eckersley decided to hang up his boots for good. He wanted to discover what else life could offer that would bring him even closer to his family.",
      "\"My daughter was born in the June and I literally stopped playing,\" he said. \"I wasn't interested in making any calls to my agent and I wasn't interested in football.",
      "\"We went to this wedding on the Isle of Man, we were hanging out as a family, just the three of us, and on the way back I was like, 'I really enjoyed that, I want to do it more often. I don't just want to keep being moved to here, there and everywhere, trying to find a career in football.'",
      "\"I felt that it was telling me something and that I needed to do something different. That was the reason that I said to my wife on the way back, 'I'm done, I'm not going to continue with this, I'm going to do something different'.\"",
      "What followed wasn't your typical ex-footballer tale. Determined to start afresh for himself and his family, Eckersley, alongside his wife and daughter, journeyed to Totnes in Devon in a camper van.",
      "They immediately fell in love with the town, so much so that they chose to relocate there for good. Eckersley was determined to contribute something meaningful to the local community and launched a shop. With a deep passion for vegan and organic produce, Eckersley and his wife established Earth.Food.Love, pioneering zero-waste retail outlet.",
      "He said: \"We wanted to find somewhere where we wanted to live; it wasn't the zero-waste shop that came first, it was where we wanted to live.",
      "\"We were living in a city centre apartment near Spinningfields [in Manchester] and we wanted to move somewhere where there was nature, vegan alternatives and all these kinds of things that we had picked up on our road leading up to this point.",
      "\"Obviously, having lived in Toronto and New York, you get access to these alternatives. Living in Manchester, there are alternatives, of course, but I felt to choose a place where we wanted to live was the cornerstone.",
      "\"We sat on the beach [near Totnes] and said that we wanted to make this our home. Obviously, we need to do something while we're here. We wanted to invest back into the community. The idea of a shop came about and, initially, the idea was that it was going to be a whole foods shop.",
      "\"There was already a whole foods shop in Totnes. We thought about what else we could do that makes us unique. The idea of a zero-waste aspect whole foods shop was unique and would draw people in. That was how it started.\"",
      "Besides operating Earth.Food.Love, Eckersley also runs ReRooted, which produces plant milks that are now distributed across the UK. Despite how hectic managing two distinct enterprises can be, Eckersley is enjoying life.",
      "\"I don't finish at 2pm anymore,\" he quipped, referring back to his football days. \"Those days are pretty much gone. But there is flexibility.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like I am getting pulled from pillar to post. But it is a joy because it is something that I am enjoying doing. It doesn't feel like a chore and it doesn't feel like I am working a 9-5 job.\"",
      "Despite only making a few appearances for United, Eckersley reveals he's often recognised by customers in the shop, leading to requests for him to participate in charity matches.",
      "\"I am just like, after a long day in the shop or at my other company, I am a little bit knackered,\" he said. \"I just want to go home, put my kids to bed, and then probably go to bed myself.",
      "\"I don't really want to play football afterwards. I do play every now and again down on the astroturf at the local school, but it is very fleeting.\"",

      "The right-back was signed for around £12million, having previously enjoyed a successful period at Lille where he clinched the Ligue 1 title in 2011. In his debut season with the Gunners, Debuchy was restricted to just 15 appearances across all competitions due to injuries.",
      "Upon regaining full fitness, he found it difficult to replace Hector Bellerin as the first-choice right-back. In the 2015/16 season, he only played twice before securing a loan move to Bordeaux in the January transfer window, hoping to secure a spot in France's Euro 2016 squad.",
      "Despite returning to his home country, Debuchy expressed frustration over how he was treated at Arsenal. He claimed that the Gunners had stopped a possible move to Premier League rivals United a year earlier and admitted that he barely spoke with Wenger.",
      "Reflecting on his proposed move to Old Trafford, Debuchy told L’Equipe, as per ESPN: \"I wasn't playing a lot, it was United, there's nothing else to say.",
      "\"For me, it was almost unexpected, but the coach said no. It's something I did not appreciate. He wasn't using me, so I didn't see his interest in doing that.\"",
      "When asked about his relationship with veteran Arsenal boss Wenger, Debuchy revealed he barely communicated with his fellow Frenchman. \"We acknowledge each other, we say hello, nothing more,\" he added.",
      "Debuchy claimed that Arsenal had blocked his transfer to Old Trafford, forcing him to join Bordeaux, where he featured nine times. Despite rumoured interest from clubs including Espanyol and Fiorentina, he couldn't secure a permanent switch and encountered a similar scenario once more in December 2016, though fitness issues prevented him from securing a fresh start.",
      "\"My situation doesn't meet what I had been hoping for, but that's football,\" he said. \"There have been things, injuries and the coach's choices that have meant that I haven't played. Even if I don't understand, I'm not surprised, I know how it works. [I want] a way out. I want to take on a new challenge, to get back into it, to simply do my job properly.\"",
      "However, Debuchy's accusations didn't go unanswered. Arsenal manager Wenger rejected the notion that Arsenal had prevented a potential switch to United and also addressed other transfer speculation concerning the defender.",
      "\"They have never made an offer for him,\" Wenger said, as per the Guardian. \"It's completely untrue. It's sometimes surprising to hear things like that.",
      "\"When he had the opportunities to play when Bellerín was injured, he was injured [too]. So I cannot do anything about that. I gave him last year the opportunity to go to Bordeaux on loan, but we had nobody coming in for him over the summer period and there are some things that are not true in this article.",
      "\"We never blocked him to go to Fiorentina, nor Espanyol. They had no interest in him at all because we checked that, so you have to take this [L'Equipe] article with a little distance.\"",
      "Debuchy eventually got his wish to leave Arsenal in January 2018, six months before his Gunners contract expired. He moved to Saint Etienne without a transfer fee and remained there for three and a half years. He then enjoyed a two-year stint with Valenciennes before retiring in 2023.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's 3-1 defeat to Brentford was dubbed \"a joke\" by Usain Bolt. Exiled defender Tyrell Malacia also sent the Red Devils' head coach a telling message.",
      "Amorim's men suffered their third loss of the new Premier League season on Saturday when they travelled to the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees striker Igor Thiago fired in a first-half double before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back, and although United were given a penalty on 76 minutes, Bruno Fernandes failed to convert.",
      "Brentford bagged a third goal to seal United's fate deep in added time, and during a calamitous first half, one of the club's more high-profile fans, 100m and 200m world record holder Bolt, branded the performance a \"joke.\"",
      "Brentford's first goal on Saturday saw Harry Maguire play striker Thiago onside before he slotted home past Altay Bayindir after just nine minutes. Less than 10 minutes later, and it was 2-0, the Brazilian bagging his second, with United's goalkeeper parrying a cross into his path.",
      "This disastrous opening 20 minutes had some fans up in arms, and even Bolt couldn't help but voice his frustrations. He took to social media and posted to X: \"This must be a joke.\"",
      "Fans in the comments of this post were equally as frustrated, with one writing: \"United are a joke. Have been for a decade.\" Another added: \"Even Bolt cannot believe how useless this club is.\"",
      "Although Sesko pulled one back for the visitors, his first goal for the club, Amorim's side were yet again defeated. The Portuguese head coach is yet to win two consecutive Premier League matches in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Away from the Brentford clash, outcast Malacia has proven to potential suitors and Amorim that he is ready to play. Failing to secure a move away this summer was another blow for the Dutchman, who has endured a torrid spell in Manchester after being brought to the club under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Though he arrived as a potential starting full-back, Malacia has found minutes tough to come by. He was sidelined for over 500 days after suffering a knee injury in 2023, which hasn't helped his cause.",
      "Moves to Elche in Spain and Turkey didn't materialise over the summer, after he spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV. Now, Malacia finds himself in exile, not suited to Amorim's wing-backed formation.",
      "However, the 26-year-old has indicated that he is ready to lace up his boots again, posting to Instagram videos of himself training at non-league side Trafford FC. He has shown both Amorim and any coaches of clubs who could look to take him on in January that he is keeping match-fit.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was introduced after 66 minutes against Brentford, and while he failed to make too much of an impact, he has shown glimpses of promise in recent weeks. Amorim continues to play Manuel Ugarte at the base of his midfield, however.",
      "Red Devils icon Ferdinand thinks the head coach must do all he can to get Mainoo more minutes, and he told the MEN: \"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it, being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself.",
      "\"But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.\"",

Strikes from Igor Thiago (x2) and substitute Mathias Jensen secured triumph for the Bees in the Premier League on Saturday, with Benjamin Sesko's maiden goal for United serving as nothing more than a consolation to the final outcome.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side found themselves trailing by two goals at the Gtech Community Stadium within 20 minutes as Thiago wreaked havoc. Sesko dragged United back into contention just before half-time from close quarters at the third attempt.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was presented with the opportunity to level from the penalty spot midway through the second period when Nathan Collins brought down Bryan Mbeumo, but his feeble attempt was kept out by Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Brentford stood firm for the remaining minutes and clinched a third during added time when Jensen unleashed a brilliant strike that rocketed past Altay Bayindir.",
      "A third loss from six league fixtures leaves United languishing in the bottom half of the standings with last weekend's triumph over Chelsea providing only modest respite for Amorim.",
      "The setback against Brentford has prompted fresh scrutiny, but when the Portuguese boss was confronted with such queries he delivered a straightforward reply.",

      "American referee David Gerson reckons Brentford should have been reduced to 10 men during Manchester United's crushing 3-1 defeat at the G-Tech Community Stadium. Brentford defender Nathan Collins escaped a red card after hauling down Bryan Mbeumo in the second half. The Bees defender pulled back his former teammate inside the box.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson brandished a yellow card whilst Video Assistant Referee Andy Madley, working alongside assistant Nicholas Hopton, reviewed the incident at Stockley Park and ruled it wasn't worthy of a dismissal. Bruno Fernandes stepped up to take the penalty with Brentford leading 2-1, but his strike was kept out.",
      "Justifying the call, the Premier League Match Centre posted on X: \"The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back. VAR also checked the referee's call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.\"",
      "Yet Gerson, who shared his thoughts on Instagram, took issue with the Premier League's stance.",
      "\"This is absolutely a red card for denial of obvious goalscoring opportunity,\" he declared. \"How this was only a yellow card and penalty, I don't understand. Let me go ahead and dispel some myths, double jeopardy, you can't give a red card in a penalty kick. Absolutely, you can. The laws have changed over the years, it used to be the case you couldn't, now you can.",
      "\"The second thing, what are DOGSO (Denial of Goal Scoring Opportunity) conditions, so distance, absolutely met, number of defenders, there's no one between the foul and the goal, and then you got direction, he's right in the middle of the field, he's going towards goal and then, likely to control.",
      "\"That's right, you don't need to have control of the ball for it to be a red card, for DOGSO opportunity. This ball has not come across him yet and he's being pulled back so the foul has occurred, he's being pulled away from the ball, he absolutely has likelihood of control - a slow rolling ball for a Premier League or running onto the ball, that is absolute likelihood of control.",
      "\"So the correct decision should be a red card and a penalty kick. How they did not award this, I don't understand because it makes a difference, right. We got 15 minutes left in the game, player gets sent off and obviously they missed the penalty kick, but still, now you're playing 11 vs 10 men.",
      "\"I am really interested to hear PGMOL's explanation of this one.\" United endured their third league defeat of the campaign, sparking fresh doubts about Ruben Amorim's tenure.",

Despite Benjamin Sesko netting his maiden goal for United, a first-half brace from Igor Thiago and Mathias Jensen's late strike condemned the visitors to another disappointing result in West London.",
      "The setback has intensified scrutiny on Amorim after last campaign's dismal 15th-place finish - United's worst in Premier League history. Former Arsenal defender Keown has now delivered a scathing assessment of Amorim's reign, drawing parallels with the pressure Graham Potter faced at West Ham before his dismissal on Saturday.",

      "\"Is it because we're now the ninth manager in 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson left? This stubbornness to play the same way - they look very ordinary.",
      "\"Mbeumo playing against his old team must be wondering 'what on earth have I signed for?' because the team he plays against, his old team, was way better than them today. This is Manchester United in dire trouble right now. Decisions need to be made.\"",

United were 2-0 down after 20 minutes, with Brentford forward Igor Thiago scoring twice, before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back with his first goal since his £74million summer move.",
      "Skipper Bruno Fernandes missed a penalty to make it 2-2, with Brentford sub Mathias Jensen scoring with a fine strike in added time to compound United's miserable afternoon. Despite this latest setback, Amorim said he remains confident he can turn United around – despite their shambolic run of results under him suggesting otherwise.",
      "“I'm always doing my job,” said Amorim. “If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal, but I'm always confident, because I know what to do. It's my job and I'm not here just to protect the players. I'm trying to do what is best for the club and the team.",

      "“I try to be really objective in my analysis of the game. Today we played Brentford's game, not our own game. And when you play the opponent's game, it's harder to win. When we win, it's not the system, when we lose it's the system. I understand that. I think it's more that we play this game like Brentford wanted to play this game.",
      "“We never settled down to play our game. We never pushed the opponent. We knew that every time they recovered the ball, they would make a run and they would fight for the ball. We need to work on a lot of things. My biggest concern is that we didn't settle down in the game. In the final third we missed a lot of crosses.",

However, Igor Thiago's double in the first half and Mathias Jensen's late effort, in between Benjamin Sesko's maiden goal for United, meant the Red Devils returned from West London with nothing to show for their efforts.",

      "Manchester United are prepared to sacrifice getting any kind of transfer fee for Jadon Sancho as club chiefs lean towards letting him leave for nothing.",
      "It is a damning indictment of what has happened to Sancho's career at Old Trafford since they splashed £73million to sign him from German side Borussia Dortmund. The 25-year-old has become an outcast at United and is now on his third loan spell away from the club.",
      "After a stint back in the Bundesliga with Dortmund and last season's ill-fated spell at Chelsea, he's now on loan at Aston Villa. And the Villans are hopeful that they can get the ex-Manchester City youngster back to something like his best, before signing him permanently at the end of the season.",
      "At that point Sancho is hopeful of becoming a free agent. His current £200k-a-week deal at United runs out in June, but the Red Devils have the option to activate a 12-month extension to his current contract.",
      "That would subsequently allow United to demand a small fee, with the club aware that they simply won't see big money for the winger. But such a move would risk complicating a possible transfer for Sancho elsewhere.",
      "And it's understood United are so keen to see the back of Sancho, that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is prepared to let him walk out on the club for nothing - bringing to an end one of the most disastrous signings in English football history.",
      "That's good news for Villa, who will have first refusal from Sancho and his camp, if he can make a success of his spell in the West Midlands.",
      "Sancho joined United in 2021 in a £73m deal that was widely seen as something of a coup at the time, such had been the impression he had made in Germany. But he never made a significant impact and was loaned back to Dortmund following a public bust-up with ex-United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "He made 31 appearances for Chelsea last term, and helped them win the UEFA Conference League. But Chelsea were forced to pay United a £5m penalty fee, after rejecting the option to make the deal permanent for £25m.",
      "Sancho returned to United in June, but became one of five stars to find themselves banned from joining the squad for pre-season training by manager Ruben Amorim. He was told to stay away and resolve his future, which he did by engineering a move to Villa.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United and bitter rivals Liverpool are on a collision course in the transfer market once more - over Everton and England defender Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "The centre-back is a long-time target of the Old Trafford top brass, who tried to sign him from the blue half of Merseyside before. But when the Toffees stuck to their asking price, that deal went away.",
      "However, United's interest in Branthwaite didn't and he remains their No.1 choice to replace Harry Maguire. The England defender turns 33 in March and is out of contract at the end of the season. The expectation is that United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe won't be giving Maguire an extension to his current deal.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is planning for life without Maguire next season, while he also has doubts about the long-term fitness of injury prone defender Lisandro Martinez.",
      "That will see United move for Branthwaite again - but Liverpool are also very keen on the 23 year-old. It remains to be seen whether Branthwaite would be willing to make the move across Merseyside, but it hasn't stopped others in the past.",
      "And there can be no doubt that right now, a move to Liverpool rather than United is likely to be more tempting.",
      "However, Everton won't be easy to negotiate with, given Branthwaite has a deal until 2030 and he's one of their prized assets. Yet United may test the water with a £65m bid in the January transfer window, looking to steal an early march on the Premier League champions.",
      "Branthwaite is regarded as one of the brightest young prospects in English football.",
      "So far he has won only the one England cap, but is regarded as an outside bet to be included in Thomas Tuchel's final squad for next summer's World Cup.",

      "Defeat at Brentford was United's third in the league this season after losses against Arsenal and Manchester City, with Amorim acknowledging his side's continued failings. \"It's always the same to lose at this club, it hurts a lot,\" said Amorim. \"We need to think about the next one.\"",

They're not sure where they're meant to be,\" he said on Match of the Day. \"In terms of the goals, there were individual errors.

      "Chief Manchester United Football Correspondent. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to let down, frustrate and infuriate him and United's loyal fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "When Brentford's third goal in added time, their fans taunted Amorim with chants of \"sacked in the morning\" and their returning former hero, Bryan Mbeumo, with cries of \"Bryan, what's the score?\", sparing neither as they revelled in their deserved victory.",
      "Here, the seeds of United's latest setback were sown inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after United's chief executive Omar Berrada went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stat that matters is results, which have been lamentable.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the Chelsea win, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro, who was serving a one-match ban following his red card in the victory over Chelsea.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later, Brentford again exposing United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, but only as far as Thaigo, who steered it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £70m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26 th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig, with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "United skipper Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot for the second time this season, following his miss in a 1-1 draw at Fulham, with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort this time. United's misery was compounded in the 95th minute, when sub Mathias Jensen made it 3-1 with a majestic strike after a breakaway move.",
      "Next up for United are Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same way as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes missed his second penalty of the Premier League season as Manchester United reverted to type in a disappointing defeat at Brentford. United came into the game on the back of the 2-1 win over Chelsea, yet familiar failing undermined their performance in west London.",
      "Brentford found themselves 2-0 up inside 20 minutes as Igor Thiago took advantage of some shaky United defending to help himself. First he latched onto a long ball over the top of the defence from Jordan Henderson to blast into the top corner before gobbling up a rebound after Altay Bayindir pushed the ball out into his path.",
      "United then finally woke up and Benjamin Sesko needed three bites of the cherry to slam in his first United goal from close range. Bayindir made a good low save to keep out Dango Ouattara before Nathan Collins' foul on Bryan Mbeumo offered a route back into the game for the away side.",
      "But after a long delay Fernandes saw his effort saved by penalty expert Caoimhin Kelleher and substitute Mathias Jensen made the three points safe for Brentford on the break in injury time as chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" rang out from the stands. Here are the talking points after United made it eight league away games without a win.",
      "United were seen drilling their preparations for defending set pieces before kick off, but they didn't seem ready for what Brentford threw at them once the match started. The same old shaky backline, that has come to define Amorim's side, was there and Brentford took full advantage.",
      "If it wasn't for a few strong saves from Bayindir, they could easily have been 3-0 down following a nightmare start. Harry Maguire played Thiago onside for the first goal before Matthijs de Ligt found himself out of position for the second, which came from another simple long ball.",
      "It was a shambolic start for the away side, who had a week to prepare for this game, having already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, the third round of which took place in midweek.",
      "This match was a perfect example of trend as Brentford's Michael Kayode and United's Diogo Dalot launched the ball into the box at every opportunity. It's nothing new at Brentford, who used the tactic successfully last season, but United have now jumped on the bandwagon.",
      "But, as Gronnemark warned, there's a lot more to it than simply chucking it and hoping. “For most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,\" he said. \"There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League.\"",
      "Sesko arrived at United in a £73.7million deal from RB Leipzig with a lot of expectation on his shoulders. Having seen how Rasmus Hojlund struggled to cope with that, the Slovenian knew he needed to make a good impression early on. That didn't happen and there were signs of it beginning to get to him.",
      "His first United goal owed a lot to Caoimhin Kelleher, who failed to do with Patrick Dorgu's simple cross, but Sesko showed good determination to keep shooting. He couldn't miss the third go and the 22-year-old, who got 21 goals for Leipzig last season, is now off the mark in his seventh appearance.",
      "United's captain had the chance to bring his side level from the penalty spot after Nathan Collins pulled back Mbeumo in front of goal. Referee Craig Pawson took his time in pointing to the spot and there were further delays before Fernandes stepped up as VAR checked for a potential red card for denying a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews then made him wait even longer by making a double substitution. Fernandes side-footed towards the corner but Kelleher kept up his impressive record in penalties, saving his fourth from seven outside of shoot-outs with Brentford and Liverpool.",
      "Fernandes, meanwhile, has now missed two out of three in the Premier League this season, having skied one at Craven Cottage earlier in the season.",
      "Amorim has been United manager since November 2024. His side are still yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under his management. The United fan who has vowed not to cut his hair until they win five in a row may be waiting a long time on this evidence.",
      "Watching games like this makes you wonder what they do all week on the training pitch. With no European football or Carabao Cup to consider, United have all week to prepare for their league matches, yet they were blown away inside the opening 20 minutes and then offered little as they chased the game. The penalty was a point gift-wrapped yet they shouldn't take advantage.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",

      "\"It's really important for us to have that sense of urgency that we need to win no matter what, and it's going to be really difficult. Every time we start preparing the game and you watch the next opponent, you think, ‘It's going to be really, really tough’.",
      "\"I have that feeling. We cannot control the result of the game, but for me, the most important thing is to start the game the way we started against Chelsea, the way we started against Burnley, the way we started against Arsenal.",

      "Back in May, at the end of last season, Mbeumo was on the winning side when Brentford stormed past United at the G-Tech Community Stadium. The Cameroon international didn't get on the scoresheet, but he certainly caught Amorim's eye.",
      "On whether that particular display convinced the United boss to sign Mbeumo, he said: \"It was not that performance. But [it] helped me to understand that he's a very good player, not [just] with the ball, without the ball.",
      "\"And when you see that live, it’s completely different. When you see a guy doing that, with all due respect, it's not because he’s in Manchester United.",
      "\"He was in Brentford, he was sometimes defending as a right-back. So, that was really important to have that feeling live. And if I'm the owner of Brentford, I will do the same, to keep the best players and try to sell the best players for big amounts.",

      "During his lengthy lay-off, Malacia missed out on 70 United games and by the time he was fit again, Ten Hag had left the club. Under Amorim's new three-at-the-back system, with two wing-backs, Malacia found it hard to secure a spot.",

      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to frustrate and infuriate him and United's fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "Here, the seeds of their latest setback were sewn inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals, the United boss left shaking his head at his team's continued failings.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after the United chief executive went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stats that matter are the results, which have been lamentable.",
      "Amoirm has still to win back-to-back Premier League games, despite being in charge for nearly a year, another shocking stat for the embattled head coach.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the side that secured a hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea a week earlier, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the 'keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later. Brentford again exposed United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, only for Thaigo to steer it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort.",
      "Next up for United is Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same was as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",

There is no sense of United getting in behind Brentford’s defence and threatening their goal, and as it stands, the visitors are toothless in attack. Changes need to be made, with Mount and Zirkzee surely set to come on soon.",

      "Although United have not made the start they wanted, it's an entertaining game. The early-kick off slot can often produce slow contests, but there's a good pace to it and there has been chances at both ends.",

      "United are undone once again, conceding a sloppy second, with the home fans singing “Bryan, what’s the score?” to their former forward Mbeumo, who left them for United in the summer. Amorim’s defence found themselves on the back foot again, Bayindir palming away Schade’s cross and very nearly kept out the rebound, which was turned in by Thiago, for his second of the game. It’s a long way back for the Reds from here.",
      "This could be a repeat of the embarrassing defeat 4-0 in August 2022. Brentford lost to Fulham last weekend, and this was a huge chance to build momentum after Chelsea. United have made a shocking start and have given themselves a mountain to climb in London.",

      "Cunha comes close to producing an immediate response, just shooting wide of the post. United need to get him on the ball because he is bound to make something happen.",
      "Amorim is clearly not happy with how deep his United team are sitting, shaking his head and imploring them to push up.",
      "Moments later, United are caught cold, a long ball from Jordan Henderson met by Igor Thiago, who lets it bounce before thrashing it past Bayindir. United’s defence were convinced Thiago was offside, but after a VAR check, the goal stands and Brentford lead 1-0.",
      "That's a horrible goal to concede. It was far too simple to launch that ball forward to Thiago. Maguire was left isolated. Amorim did not look pleased before the goal, and certainly won't be happy now."

      "Last weekend's win against Chelsea improved the mood at Old Trafford, but United were unable to build on that result. Amorim has won just 34 points from a possible 99 in the top flight during his time in charge and the Brentford defeat will increase the pressure on his shoulders.",
      "Sources confirmed Amorim retained the backing of the board after Grimsby Town defeat in the Carabao Cup, but further setbacks against Manchester City and Brentford have followed.",
      "De Ligt was the only United player to take time to speak to reporters as the players left the Gtech Community Stadium. The Dutchman was not included in the leadership group that was formed in the summer, but he is understood to have taken on a leadership role in the dressing room regardless.",
      "\"Really disappointed because all week we were speaking about keeping the momentum going, getting another win under our belt and yeah, if you lose this game, it's a big blow obviously,\" he said.",
      "\"Not a nice feeling, obviously. Everybody is really disappointed. I think first of all, they are disappointed with themselves. The first thing you have to control is yourself. And if you can do that, you are first disappointed with yourself, and then also with the team and the whole result, so really disappointed.\"",
      "De Ligt stressed United must stick together. \"It's the most important thing, it's the only thing we can do,\" he said. \"As I said, it's a lot of time the same song, but still we have to stick together.",
      "\"We lost against City, we won against Chelsea, so for the next game we have to analyse what went wrong in this game because a lot of things went wrong. We need to be prepared for the next game.\"",
      "When asked about what went wrong against Brentford, he responded: \"We were short in key moments where we made the wrong decisions. That makes a big difference in football.",
      "\"I think obviously we were quite unlucky also with some chances, but yeah, overall, it was not good enough. That's a fact. Then you know, against a team like Brentford who play on the transition, with long throw-ins and corner kicks, then it's going to be really difficult.\"",
      "De Ligt was signed by Erik ten Hag and the anniversary of his sacking is next month. Amorim looked like a manager under pressure on the touchline against Brentford, but De Ligt insisted the players must deliver on the pitch and cut out the mistakes that are leading to goals.",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" he said about taking responsibility. \"I mean it's always easy to look to the manager, but in the end, the players on the pitch have to do it. We can't say the goals we conceded, or the chances we conceded, are because of what... I don't know, you guys always talk about the system.",
      "\"That also has a lot to do with focus, concentration, and if that's lacking in key moments, it's going to make a difference. Against a Brentford team who plays like this, they will kill you.\"",
      "United made a fast start against Chelsea last weekend, but were unable to reproduce those levels against Brentford. \"I think we knew exactly what they were going to do,\" reflected De Ligt.",
      "\"It was the long ball to the strikers, the counter-attack. The first goal, I haven't seen it back. Obviously it was really tight. And yeah, then it's difficult. You're 1-0 behind, which is what you don't want.",
      "\"And then it goes 2-0 quite quickly afterwards. We came back quite well, we make it 2-1 and get a penalty. In my opinion... I'm not going to say [it was a red card], but the rules are the rules. But still, we have to do it ourselves and we didn't do it today. That's really disappointing.\"",

      "Alan Shearer says Manchester United have a right to feel aggrieved after being on the wrong end of a \"terrible\" refereeing decision. Ruben Amorim's side slipped to 14th in the Premier League after a 3-1 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Igor Thiago struck twice in the first-half to give United an uphill task but Benjamin Sesko's effort before the break reduced the arrears. Bruno Fernandes was handed an opportunity from 12 yards after Bryan Mbeumo was pulled back in the box by Nathan Collins.",
      "The Republic of Ireland international avoided punishment, escaping with a yellow card. However, the United skipper saw his spot-kick saved before in second-half stoppage time, and Mathias Jensen restored their two-goal lead.",
      "Shearer has slammed the officiating and questioned the validity of the explanation behind the decision not to send Collins off.",
      "\"So they should [be aggrieved]. Yes, they got the penalty but what they didn't get, the officials, it should have been a red card as well.,\" he said on Match of the Day.",
      "\"They get it right in terms of the referee's call: he gives the penalty for the pull back. But what they didn't get right was the yellow card check for Collins.",
      "\"They deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball, I mean honestly, it's just a terrible decision.",
      "\"He can't be in control of the ball because someone is pulling him back, he's a yard from the ball, clearly.",
      "\"Yes, [Fernandes] had to wait four-and-a-half minutes before getting to that decision but that's a mistake from him. [Collins] should have been sent off - absolutely no doubt about it.\"",
      "The Premier League's Match Centre account on X posted an explanation regarding the decision to award a penalty but also not send off the Brentford defender, which Shearer disagreed with.",
      "\"The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back,\" the post said.",
      "\"VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.\"",
      "However, a community note - an aspect of the social media website that was integrated to deny falsehoods being spread widely - seemingly rubbished the notion that Collins avoided red as it was deemed that the United man \"wasn't in control of the ball\".",

Ruben Amorim's side failed to make it back-to-back wins, giving themselves a mountain to climb in the capital as Bruno Fernandes missed a second-half penalty.",
      "It was the manner in which the Bees conceded the spot-kick which has sparked uproar. Matheus Cunha played it across to Bryan Mbeumo, with a clear sight of goal, before he was hauled down in the penalty area by Collins.",
      "The penalty was given and the Republic of Ireland international was shown a yellow card for the action of pulling the Cameroon forward but following an explanation from the Premier League Match Centre X account, a community note has emerged on the tweet.",
      "Initially, the account provided the reasoning why Collins avoided a sending off, it read: \"The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back.",

      "Premium users of the platform are able to add community notes where they can prove that the initial point is incorrect.",
      "Citing the International Football Association Board (IFAB) laws of the game, a rebuttal was put forward which read: \"Control of the ball is not required for a red card.",
      "\"For DOGSO (denial of a goalscoring opportunity), referees consider distance to goal, direction of play, likelihood of keeping/gaining the ball, and defenders' positions. It's about likelihood, not current control.\"",
      "In the IFAB laws, it states: \"Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.\"",
      "In the context of the game, Collins remained on the field when the red card would have given United a lift.",
      "While there is no guarantee that Fernandes would have dispatched the penalty anyway, it could well have aided their response to the 2-1 scoreline - which eventually became three when Mathias Jensen rounded off proceedings in the fifth minute of stoppage time.",
      "Amorim addressed the incident post-match but was keen not to be distracted from the result.",
      "\"The referee told me that Bryan was not in control of the ball,\" Amorim said via the BBC Sport.",

      "Former France international Emmanuel Petit has previously claimed that Zinedine Zidane would need demands to be met before taking charge of Manchester United. The Champions League-winning head coach has been mentioned in the conversation to replace Ruben Amorim as pressure mounts.",
      "United failed to make it back-to-back wins as they failed to build on last weekend's triumph over Chelsea, with Brentford running out 3-1 winners on Saturday. Two first-half strikes from Igor Thiago gave the visitors a mountain to climb following a slow start in the capital.",
      "Benjamin Sesko reduced the arrears, netting his first for the club, before Bruno Fernandes squandered a golden opportunity from the spot to level proceedings 15 minutes from time.",
      "Mathias Jensen rounded off the scoring deep into stoppage to compound a miserable afternoon for the travelling United contingent.",
      "It leaves United in 14th on seven points as Keith Andrews' side leapfrogged them with their triumph.",
      "Amorim continues to face speculation over an exit after failing to arrest their inconsistency and poor form. It has led to Zidane being linked with the post, but should a decision be taken, they will have to coax the former Real Madrid head coach in from the cold.",

      "\"Honestly, I know a little bit, Zizou [Zidane], and he needs to get guarantees if he wants to sign over there in Manchester United,\" Petit said in 2024.",

    "body": [
      "\"Today is Nick Cox's last day. How on earth that has been allowed to happen is beyond me,\" read a text from a contact.",
      "Cox has departed Manchester United after nine years of service, six of which were spent as head of the academy.",
      "In that time, Cox played a pivotal role in United's academy renaissance, helped 35 players make their senior debuts, secured top youth signings and oversaw an FA Youth Cup triumph.",
      "Cox already had a foot through the exit door when the Under-21s played at Old Trafford in midweek, but he is understood to have followed the game. He would have smiled as the youngsters scored a last-minute winner at the Stretford End. That is the kind of experience he spoke so warmly about.",
      "United are losing an integral cog in their academy. Cox has joined Everton to become their technical director and he will look back on his time in Manchester with great pride.",
      "Cox joined United from Sheffield United in 2016. He joined as academy operations manager, working alongside Nicky Butt, and was promoted to academy head three years later.",
      "\"He leaves the academy in excellent shape to continue attracting and developing world-class talent, and well-rounded young people,\" said a club statement in June announcing he would leave.",
      "Cox's main priority was supplementing the first team with academy talent, and he will look back on the players who made that step up during his tenure with huge fondness. However, he had just as much time for youngsters who didn't achieve that dream, the players whose careers were destined for elsewhere.",
      "He was self-deprecating and generous with his time during interviews. Academy staff probably dread the sight of a reporter walking over to speak after a youth game, but Cox always engaged with a smile.",
      "Covering the academy during Cox's tenure has been uplifting, especially at a time when United's first-team has often disappointed. The academy has always been there to produce special moments.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, but the Under-18s gave fans something to cheer about by reaching the FA Youth Cup semi-final. They were superb in the quarter-finals against Arsenal at the Emirates, but ran out of steam in the last four against eventual winners Aston Villa.",
      "In 2021/22, United sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and remained in the doldrums with Ralf Rangnick. That season coincided with the U18s winning the Youth Cup for the first time since 2011.",
      "That night, Cox said: \"As the kids are running across the pitch, I'm looking and I'm seeing the Under-23s, too old for the competition, there, with their mates racing across the pitch as well. That was amazing. That was a group of mates, that was a group of kids, living out their dreams tonight.\"",
      "The Class of '22 were a supremely talented bunch of young players. Alejandro Garnacho was the star of the team, but the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Dan Gore and Rhys Bennett sparkled.",
      "Cox tells the story of how United signed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid in 2020. Garnacho, then 16, was persuaded to join over Zoom while Cox's children bickered about a video game in the background.",
      "Garnacho made 144 senior appearances for United. The winger scored against Manchester City in the 2024 FA Cup final and was sold for £40million in the summer, making him United's fourth-highest sale in their history.",
      "Through Cox's leadership, the academy regained its reputation. Facilities at Carrington improved, allowing the club to keep talents like Mainoo, who in previous years might have signed for City.",
      "Mainoo joined the club's academy aged nine, but he spent time with United and City before then. The midfielder chose to join United's academy and although City attempted to lure him away at ages when it would have been possible, he chose to stay each time.",
      "Cox understood the importance of talent retention, but recruitment was equally important during his tenure. Alvaro Fernandez arrived in the same transfer window as Garnacho in 2020 and now plays for Real Madrid.",
      "Fernandez was educated at Carrington in the latter stages of his development and feels like the one that got away. Erik ten Hag overlooked Fernandez, but academy staff are proud of his journey since leaving.",
      "More recently, Cox played a pivotal role in the signings of Toby Collyer, Harry Amass, Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi. The opportunity to sign Collyer, regarded as one of the finest young midfielders in England, came about unexpectedly, but Cox's work helped United to be at the front of the queue for his signature.",
      "Club sources were keen to give Cox the credit he deserved for signing Obi from Arsenal, describing his work as \"crucial\". The young striker's arrival last year was considered a genuine coup.",
      "Cox told the MEN: \"Because he holds a Danish passport, the whole of Europe was open to Chido. We quite simply became aware of the fact that Chido was about to make a move to Europe.",
      "\"He’d been to visit a club and identified the club where he was going to potentially end up. We thought if this player is available and is looking to leave, then we should make every effort we possibly can to sign him.",
      "\"The pretty familiar formula for Manchester United's senior and youth teams has always been having the best local players and adding some of the best talent from further afield.",
      "\"If you look back, it's George Best, it's Bobby Charlton, or it's Duncan Edwards from further afield, added to a group of local lads. Then fast forward and it's someone like Paul Pogba.\"",
      "The statistics from Cox's time at the club read well. United academy graduates played 25 per cent of first-team minutes between 2019 and 2024 - only second to Bayern Munich in the top five leagues - and United ranked second in the Premier League for minutes given to teenagers last season.",
      "Cox oversaw the continuation of United’s record of including an academy in every first-team matchday squad for over 4,200 games. That record has recently seemed under threat.",
      "The U18s won three national trophies in 2023/2024. And in the last two seasons, the U13s, U14s and U15s have been national champions. Delivering results was crucial, but Cox genuinely cared about the academy and his passion for youth development was obvious when you spoke to him.",
      "Cox was well-versed in the club's rich academy history. He wanted children to understand they were following in the footsteps of legendary United academy graduates each day.",
      "The 47-year-old became a patron of the Manchester Munich Memorial Foundation and visited Manchesterplatz as part of an academy delegation. “It is my job, in part, to make sure that our youth players fully understand and embrace the great legacy and history of our football club,\" he said.",
      "Cox was born in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, but felt part Mancunian due to his lengthy association with United.",
      "He deserves credit for establishing the academy alumni programme, which has ensured that former players remain actively engaged with the academy and receive access to support, help and advice.",
      "United's has been a forward-thinking academy. They were the first academy in England to introduce a player-coach role with the U21s, something that Liverpool subsequently copied.",
      "The pro experience programme was created, which saw young players train with EFL and non-league clubs while still playing for the academy to prepare them for potential loans.",
      "Cox helped raise £100m from academy sales, but he never wanted the academy building to become a cash cow for first-team signings. Of course, academy sales have become important due to Profit and Sustainability Rules, but Cox was an advocate of promoting talent from within.",
      "Cox faced challenges along the way. The academy has been United's only well-functioning area in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but that hasn't stopped Ineos from making changes.",
      "When mass redundancies were made, the academy lost talented staff members. Cox has worked in difficult circumstances at Carrington over the last 18 months, with reduced resources due to cost-cutting.",
      "Ineos scaled back the coverage of the academy on MUTV. There is still no dedicated social media account for academy content, or a specialised junior communications executive for media enquiries. That means existing resources and staff members have been stretched, often working long hours.",
      "It will be a near-impossible task for Cox's successor, Stephen Torpey, to emulate his work.",
      "Cox leaves behind a wonderful legacy. Just ask the players who worked with him.",

      "Manchester United lost 3-1 against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Brentford made an excellent start to the game, taking a two-goal lead within 20 minutes after a brace from Igor Thiago, giving United a mountain to climb at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit before the interval. United had a golden chance to draw level when Bryan Mbeumo won a penalty with 15 minutes remaining, but Bruno Fernandes' low effort was saved by Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Brentford wrapped up the victory with an injury-time goal from Mathias Jensen.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "The system is a problem",
      "Brentford opened the scoring far too easily, launching a long ball forward after stifling an attack from United. Harry Maguire was isolated and Thiago lashed the ball beyond Altay Bayindir.",
      "It was concerning that Brentford were able to bypass United's entire team with a simple long ball. There had been instances of the team looking disjointed before that breakthrough, with a large gap between the backline and attack, so the manner of Brentford's goal wasn't surprising.",
      "Ruben Amorim finally had a chance to address the problem when Sesko halved the deficit, which allowed him to usher Maguire and Luke Shaw to the touchline to receive tactical instructions.",
      "United's head coach should not need to address the space between the backline, midfield and attack at this stage of his tenure. That should be second nature to his players.",
      "The problem is part of the ongoing conversation around Amorim's system and the debate about whether he will succeed at Old Trafford with his approach. He is still yet to win back-to-back league games.",
      "The chant from United's fans",
      "The tempo dropped after play resumed for the second half and there was a worrying lack of urgency from United, who were trailing by a goal and supposed to be trying to find a way back into the game.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" pleaded the travelling away support. It all looked far too pedestrian, despite Amorim trying to gee up his players from the sidelines.",
      "There was hope United would build on their Chelsea victory but it's another false dawn.",
      "The reception for Mainoo",
      "There was a loud cheer when Kobbie Mainoo was introduced to the game in the 66th minute. Many wondered whether Mainoo would be given his first start of the Premier League season against Brentford, but Manuel Ugarte was selected to start alongside Fernandes instead.",
      "Ugarte was wasteful, losing possession far too often. The 24-year-old is not having a good season and the reaction to Mainoo's introduction hinted United fans think he should be involved more often.",
      "It didn't take long for Mainoo to offer what Ugarte did not. The youngster escaped a tight space with the ball at his feet, and impressively broke up a Brentford attack moments later.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo has been questionable this season.",
      "Cunha showed his frustration",
      "It didn't take long for Cunha to become frustrated with how the game was unfolding. He tried to encourage his teammates as they prepared for the restart following Thiago's opener and became animated with Sesko when he picked the wrong pass, which botched a sweeping move forward.",
      "Cunha had further words with Sesko when the ball went out of play for a throw-in. The Brazilian isn't afraid to dish out orders to his teammates and Amorim has praised that part of his character.",
      "However, it works both ways, and Cunha can make wrong decisions on the ball himself, just like when he chose to shoot from the edge of the box instead of sliding Fernandes through.",
      "Cunha, Sesko and Mbeumo started together for the first time against Brentford and there were teething problems.",
      "Mbeumo reunion",
      "Mbeumo returned to the Gtech Community Stadium for the first time since signing for United for £65m in the summer. The forward spent six successful years with Brentford and left on good terms.",
      "Before the warm-ups began, Mbeumo chatted with his former teammates on the pitch and seemed in good spirits. He shared an embrace with a handful of his former colleagues, and Brentford's supporters gave Mbeumo a loud cheer when the stadium announcer read out his name.",
      "Mbeumo scored in Brentford's 4-0 hammering of United in August 2022 when Erik ten Hag was in charge, and memories of that game came flooding back as the Bees took a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes.",
      "The Cameroon international played a brilliant cross into the box in the second half, but nobody was there to connect with it. Mbeumo didn't have that problem during his stint with Brentford.",
      "\"Bryan, what's the score?\" sang Brentford's fans at the end of the game.",

      "Brexit rules mean Manchester United's academy recruitment is limited to the United Kingdom. English clubs cannot sign talented teenagers from Europe under the age of 18.",
      "That means United must wait until a player from Europe celebrates their 18th birthday to act on their interest. However, players are usually tied down and more difficult to sign by that stage of their career.",
      "United still operate in the European market when opportunities arise and were proactive in wrapping up the signing of Enzo Kana-Biyik on a free transfer from Le Havre this summer.",
      "Since Ineos invested in the club, there has been increased activity in markets outside of Europe. Sekou Kone was signed from Mali in 2024, Diego Leon arrived from Paraguay this summer and United have struck a preliminary agreement to sign Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco.",
      "The defensive midfielder plays for Fortaleza CEIF, has captained Colombia's Under-17 team and helped his nation reach the final of the U17 South American Championship in the spring.",
      "United have identified Orozco as an exciting young talent with potential to progress to the first-team. However, Orozco will not be able to complete a move to Old Trafford until he turns 18 next year, so he will continue to play for Fortaleza CEIF until the transfer can be finalised in July.",
      "The same approach was taken with Leon. In January, United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign Leon and he continued to play in Paraguay until relocating to Manchester this summer.",
      "Kone was signed for around £1m from Mali club Guidars FC. He was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "Having followed Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where Kone featured as one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament.",
      "The likelihood is that Orozco was tracked by United at the U17 South American Championship. Scouts were impressed by Kone's displays for Mali and Orozco has shown great potential with Colombia.",
      "Orozco will arrive in Manchester with a similar profile to Kone: young, raw and possessing huge potential. These kinds of transfers are essentially low risk and high reward for United.",
      "The best-case scenario is that a signing breaks into the first team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "United are planning for the future and trying to explore markets further afield more often. Other Premier League clubs have made more use of non-European markets and have landed some gems.",
      "Brighton have been the standard-setting team in the league for recruitment for some time now, and the Seagulls' data-driven approach has unearthed some wonderfully gifted players.",
      "United wanted to sign Moises Caicedo in December 2020, but the £5.5m asking price was too steep. Brighton agreed a deal and sold Caicedo to Chelsea just two-and-a-half years later for £115m.",
      "Ineos' decision-makers will be praised if Kone, Leon or Orozco can develop their games like Caicedo did. The only downside is they need time and patience to grow, which is something rarely afforded at United.",
      "Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources have indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand is fronting a new campaign this weekend to help end the stigma around parents discussing careers with their children.",
      "Ahead of this weekend's Premier League action, Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch Half Time Talks. The idea is for parents to sit down with their children during the 15-minute break to discuss more than just tactics but also their plans for their future careers.",
      "Ferdinand, alongside Talking Futures, have created online resources to help prep parents for what is arguably one of the toughest conversations they can have with their teenagers. When asked why he chose to front this new initiative, the former United Premier League and Champions League winner explained how he wanted to end the panic that sets in when talking about jobs.",
      "\"I just thought that I am in the sweet spot of people who need this type of information,\" he explained in an exclusive interview with MEN Sport. \"I have got three teenage kids, two boys and a girl.",
      "\"My two boys have made their mind up and want to be footballers, but my daughter is 14 and she is having a panic attack every time we mention careers because she does not know what she wants to do. We are saying to her, most kids your age haven’t normally got a clue what they want to do.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"If they have got their eye on something right now, it doesn’t always end up being that job that they go in. It is very, very fortunate if that’s the case.",
      "\"I think this initiative kind of helps parents talk to their children through football. At half-time, that is when you have got your kids engaged.",
      "\"That’s when parents have got that connection with their kids and it is at that time to broach the conversation about careers which is normally a difficult conversation for parents to have with their kids.\" At the Premier League matches this weekend, leaflets will be handed out about the Half Time Talk and further information will also be available for parents in the matchday programmes.",
      "And it is a lack of information which Ferdinand believes can only end up driving anxiety in the subject. \"You need the information at your fingertips to go and execute [a career] and not knowing creates panic and anxiety within families,\" he added.",
      "\"As a parent, you want to help your kids and give them the opportunities and that’s why I think it is important for families to watch the film that we have done - there are loads of tips and resources in there - to put you in the best position to help them get their hands on a good job that they can get up everyday and feel passionate about.\"",

      "Chido Obi was rested for Manchester United Under-21s' game against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "Travis Binnion named Obi on the bench for the opening Premier League International Cup game. The U21s have a busy schedule this month and the decision was made to give Obi a rest.",
      "Obi played the full 90 minutes in a league victory against Liverpool last Sunday. The U21s were still able to claim a 2-1 win against Bilbao to get their PL International Cup campaign off to a flying start at Old Trafford.",
      "Bilbao were leading 1-0 and were comfortable until Binnion made four changes on the hour mark.",
      "Shea Lacey, Amir Ibragimov, Finley McAllister and Gabriele Biancheri were introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald, Jim Thwaites, Victor Musa and Reece Munro, and the changes had the desired effect.",
      "Biancheri provided an assist for James Scanlon and scored a late match-winner in added time.",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "In truth I think 2-1 flattered us; on another day we are losing that by 3 or 4 goals. Kerkez just doesn’t quite look ready for this level of scrutiny and pressure. He probably benefit from the introduction that Robertson got when he signed by being the understudy until Christmas and getting all the low profile games for now.",
      "I think in the first half we tried to play a 4-4-2 with Wirtz in some sort of free role but I don’t think it quite suited. He did pop up in lots of places but I am not sure it really suited anyone else in the team. We looked so disjointed and were maybe guilty of overthinking the set up for this game. Gakpo and moving back to a 4-3-3 instantly made us look more balanced and dangerous.",

Clear red card for denial of goal-scoring opportunity, no effort to play the ball by [Nathan] Collins, yet four minutes wasted only for officials to avoid making the decision. Then subs. Poor penalty Fernandes, who has shown he can be affected by delays.’",

      "It’s never a great sign when the producer of a broadcaster flips from a close-up reaction shot of a player to a wide image of someone bearing down on goal with no-one anywhere near him. Something has definitely gone wrong.",
      "The individual in question presumably, and quite reasonably, thought Matheus Cunha’s frustration at not being awarded a free-kick after Diogo Dalot’s poor pass spoiled a very presentable opportunity on the break for Manchester United would make for better TV than whatever might happen from Jordan Henderson’s hoof forward.",
      "They couldn’t have predicted the electric shock Harry Maguire appeared to be subjected to as his absurdly tardy and ill-advised decision to play offside saw him jump forward in vain, as Igor Thiago charged toward the United goal to create a delightful 30-yard gap between the pair by the time the cameras caught up.",
      "It was some strike. The sort of f***-it finish that would end up in row Z 99 times out of 100 as Thiago half-volleyed the bouncing ball in off the stanchion.",
      "And after Ruben Amorim’s worrying suggestion that Bryan Mbeumo is “different” to the rest of his teammates as he doesn’t immediately catastrophise after going behind, the summer signing was powerless to a collective sh*tting of the bed from the pessimistic Red Devils which ensued for the next 15 minutes and barely abated for the rest of the game.",
      "The widely condemned Altay Bayindir did indeed look like the “only line of defence”, as observed by commentator Darren Fletcher, with the Turkey international making two excellent saves in quick succession to deny Sepp van den Berg and then Nathan Collins, as United’s work on set pieces in the warm-up looked only to have confused them. Brentford were first to every long throw-in or corner delivered into the box. And to balls smashed out from the back.",
      "Thiago is a big lad, and there’s no great shame in losing an aerial battle to him, but there absolutely is in allowing him to chest the ball down to a teammate under no pressure from a ball punted from at least 60 yards. It was pathetic from Mattihjs de Ligt, as was his failure to then track Thiago into the box as he tapped the ball in to double Brentford’s lead.",
      "His United teammates could have helped him out of a bind, but didn’t, with Manuel Ugarte, Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw the firefighters with their d*cks in their hands.",
      "And in a clear example of the fragile confidence at United, after a very solid start to the season, certainly compared to last, De Ligt crumbled, misplacing passes, misjudging the flight of the ball and conceding needless free-kicks. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he air kicked and fell over in his own box.",
      "We didn’t see any great uptick in forward fluency as United’s £200m forward trio started together for the first time. Link-up between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha ended with either a poor final pass or a timid effort from one or the other until Cunha’s cross for Mbeumo led to the United penalty. And while Peter Crouch claimed Benjamin Sesko’s goal was an example of his “commitment”, it is undeniably funny that he needed three shots to score from inside the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United may well have had the most shots (79), created the most chances (60) and accrued the most expected goals (9.7) in the Premier League after the first five games, but it never really felt as though the Brentford goal was under any great pressure.",
      "Amorim was proved right in sticking with Bayindir, who made another brilliant save to deny Dango Ouattara and keep his side in the game midway through the second half, but the space Outtara found himself in on the penalty spot begs the question as to why he continues to pick Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could be just as late in tracking back as the Uruguayan in such a situation, but also probably wouldn’t be, and wouldn’t either give the ball away or play a pass sideways or backwards whenever he has possession.",
      "And as predicted when the team news was announced, Amorim will face some difficult questions as to why he’s dropped Leny Yoro for the last two games after what looked to be a very assured start to the season. Both his speed and ability to progress the ball would have very useful here, and surely an improvement on what any of Maguire, De Ligt or Shaw provided.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Bayindir immediately proves Crouch right after ‘three No.2s’ Man Utd claim\n👉 Amorim set for pelters if Man Utd lose to Brentford thanks to three uninspiring selections\n👉 Amorim leads sack race with Emery after West Ham bin Graham Potter",
      "We thoroughly look forward to the PGMOL apology to Manchester United for somehow failing to advise Craig Pawson to even look at the pitch-side monitor as Nathan Collins denied Mbeumo one of the clearest goalscoring opportunities imaginable, particularly as the time it took to make that wrong decision contributed to an interminable wait for Bruno Fernandes to take the penalty which he then missed, as some excellent substitution sh*thousery from Keith Andrews made it a five-minute delay.",
      "United still had 15 minutes including stoppage time to draw level against a side which has dropped more points (8) from winning positions than any other team in the Premier League this season, but it was Brentford who added to their lead, with substitute Mathias Jensen combining with Yehor Yarmolyuk on the break before smashing the ball past Bayindir.",
      "Joe Cole described Manchester United as “abysmal” after the final whistle, but refused to pin the blame on Amorim, instead claiming it’s the old “culture of the club” problem rearing its head again.",
      "But f*** that. This is on Amorim. He picked the wrong team, his formation and tactics don’t work, and his players crumble at the merest hint of a hardship. If this isn’t the worst team in Manchester United history, it’s surely the easiest to play against. The best the fans can hope for is more false dawns under a manager not fit for purpose.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been in ‘direct contact’ with Gareth Southgate as Ruben Amorim faces being sacked.",

      "Altay Bayindir has done little to prove Peter Crouch was wrong to feel Manchester United have “three No.2s” after Brentford’s second goal in their Premier League meeting.",
      "Bayindir started his sixth straight Premier League game as United made the trip to Brentford on Saturday. He’d been behind Andre Onana in the pecking order last season, but was clearly preferred to him at the beginning of this campaign, leading to Onana being loaned to Trabzonspor.",
      "He said: “It feels to me, the situation with the goalkeeper just hasn’t been addressed. I think it feels like they’ve got three No.2s. It’s an issue that was obvious, Onana wasn’t going to be the No.1. I think we knew that. And I don’t think the situation’s been addressed.",
      "“And obviously they’ve brought the young lad in who isn’t starting, Lammens, has come in, and you know, he was brought to potentially be a No.1 and can’t get in the team. He’s still a young lad. He’s had one real season in in football, and obviously they’re starting Bayindir.”",
      "Within the first few minutes of the match against Brentford, Bayindir both made a positive contribution, with a good double save, and undid that with the Bees second goal.",
      "Bayindir saved a tight effort from Kevin Schade, but parried immediately into the path of Igor Thiago, whose effort into the middle of the goal was met with Bayindir’s left hand, but he was unable to stop it, and he followed by punching the turf in frustration.",
      "Whether Lammens is given his first start soon remains to be seen. Our friends at TEAMtalk have suggested it is coming.",
      "For Crouch, he feels that will eventually be the case, though he’s not sure why one of two better keepers were not signed at Old Trafford.",
      "He said: “And I don’t know why, when [Gianluigi] Donnarumma maybe, or [Emiliano] Martinez were available in the summer, that this situation wasn’t resolved.",
      "“I think [Lammens] understood the situation that he was going to be a No.2, he’s found himself in a No.1 situation, obviously, they don’t think that Lammens is ready. He’s still a young man, and eventually, maybe the No.1.",
      "“But a club of Man United’s stature, you know, you think about [Fabian] Barthez and [Edwin] Van Der Sar and [Peter] Schmeichel, over the course of the history, I know we keep harping on about Manchester United’s history, they’ve always had a dominant goalkeeper, and I think with Martinez, it just felt the obvious situation that he would come in, and he’s dominant, he’s a character, you know, he’s someone that fits the stature and personnel of Manchester United.”",

      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",

      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",

      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",

      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",

Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "Former Liverpool coach Thomas Gronnemark has hit out at Arne Slot, Mikel Arteta and other Premier League managers over their “really ugly” strategy.",
      "Gronnemark is famed for working under Jurgen Klopp between 2018 and 2023 and has imparted his expertise on a number of top clubs and national teams as the world’s only professional throw-in coach.",
      "The 49-year-old used to hold the world record for the longest throw-in, at 51.33 metres and has spent 21 years carving throw-in niche for himself, but isn’t impressed by the standard of them in the Premier League this season as we see a huge uptick in the number of long throws.",
      "He claims “the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low” in what is a “really ugly” part of the game thanks to the poor strategy.",
      "“You can say there are many more long throw-ins in the Premier League. You can say ‘isn’t that good?’ No, not necessarily! There are far too many teams taking low-quality long throw-ins. Some of the throw-ins are just not long enough, so they’re not dangerous, and sometimes it’s about the strategy,” Gronnemark told Mirror.",
      "“It’s also about entertainment for the fans. People might think that a guy who coaches long throw-ins wants a lot of them. Actually, I don’t. I don’t want to see every team take 10 long throw-ins in every game because then we have too much start and stop.",
      "“People just look at the best teams and say ‘they’re having real success data-wise, so we’ll do the same’. But they are forgetting that there’s a lot of work, many years’ worth, behind it. You have to do space creation around the opponents’ penalty area.",
      "“To be honest, for most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,” he explains. “There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League: the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low. Possession rates are at around 25 to 33 per cent on throw-ins under pressure. The standard is really low.",
      "“When I was at Liverpool the quality went up, but it’s started to go down again. I think one of the reasons is that they’re only training one or two routines in each zone. Yeah, it can work but your players have to learn to think throw-ins.”",

      "Gronnemark has been working with Brentford this season and they stand out as a team benefitting from their use, having put 23 into the opponents’ penalty area this season, resulting in one goal, 11 shots and 1.29 xG.",
      "“If you’re a world-class throw-in taker, it’s much easier to put the ball where you want with a throw-in than with a corner kick,” he added. “How many corners hit the first man? It’s hard to kick with your foot. It’s much easier to throw with your hands if you have the right technique.",
      "“There are a lot of set piece coaches now and a lot of them treat the throw-in like a corner or a free-kick.",
      "“So they say ‘we can have one or two routines in each zone’. But the challenge is that the opponents’ defending pattern will already mark this from the start then the players have a big challenge.",
      "“Even with the biggest teams in the Premier League, you can see that if they make one move and it doesn’t work then the players don’t know what to do – they’re getting confused, frustrated because they don’t have a high throw-in intelligence.”",

      "Nevin proposed a theory as to why United are sticking with the former Sporting boss and claims either Michael Carrick or Darren Fletcher, both of whom know very well what it means to succeed at United have played under Sir Alex Ferguson, could take the reins as caretaker boss should United sack Amorim.",
      "Carrick is currently without a club having been let go by Middlesbrough in the summer, while Fletcher is coaching the United U18s.",
      "“Short term, I wouldn’t be surprised at [Carrick or Fletcher to replace Amorim] at all,” Nevin said, speaking to gaming news publisher Escapist Magazine. “That would be absolutely fine. And they might do well.",
      "“They offered the caretaker role to Ole first didn’t they. It takes the pressure off, you can have a good look around. And if he does well, we just keep him. That’s fine. You’ll get a bit of pressure in the press saying, ‘They don’t know what to do, they haven’t got a clue, they can’t get the right man, all that sort of stuff.’",
      "“I”ve been there before. I just blanked it. I don’t care. I’ve got a guy doing a good job here and I wouldn’t look for the other manager. And I’ll say to them, ‘If you keep on doing well, you can get a job.’ I’m not hiding anything from anyone here. I’m looking at every possible option.",

      "“Maybe that’s been United’s problem. They’ve tried, they’ve had plans. They’ve had two, three, four, five year plans that have all lasted a year. And that’s not good. Because the next person comes in and they change it, the next one changes it.",
      "“That’s the only reason why they’re standing by Amorim just now. It’s because they know they didn’t spend time with the other ones, so we now end up with a Frankenstein team.

      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "And why are Football365 trying to get Ange Postecoglou sacked?",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Longtime reader, first time mailer. Naturally I decided to pop the cherry on a safe and non-controversial topic: Marcus Rashford.",
      "I think the problem with what Ian Watson and a handful of Mailbox ultras have been saying about the ongoing Scholes/Rashford drama is that they think that the reason why what Scholes said is problematic is solely because of the content. It’s not. It’s the very presence of the comment in a public space.",
      "To explain: Paul Scholes is fully entitled to enjoy (or not enjoy) any opinion of Marcus Rashford that he likes. He can hate him for any number of reasons, including – and this is important – stupid, nonsensical ones. Furthermore, as a United fan it makes perfect sense for him to resent Rashford up and leaving them, and there is no sense in demanding that he or any United fan wish him the best.",
      "The problem is that Paul Scholes is not just a United fan. He is a massively famous pundit who is paid, I imagine, a lot of money to talk about football. And what irks me about him STILL moaning about Rashford is just how utterly unnecessary it all is at this point. Love them or hate them, United this season are absolutely delicious narratively. They are either a sleeping giant about to awake or an old palace burning down, depending on your outlook, but the one thing that is totally not part of this saga is Marcus bloody Rashford. He is GONE. It is time to MOVE ON.",
      "I guess what I’m saying is that there seems to be an assumption from old pros that their every opinion deserves to be heard, all the time, no matter what. But I don’t particularly give a monkey’s what Scholes thinks of Rashford as a person. I’m interested in what he thinks of him as a footballer, but modern pundits aren’t quite as vocal on that subject.",
      "There is also something so bitter and nasty about Scholes saying what he said, because as much as it’s fair to hold Rashford responsible for his performances at United, it’s also important to bear in mind that the club wanted him gone. It was generally accepted that he had to go in the summer for his own good and the club’s. So with that in mind, what is the point of seeing a young man finding a new lease of life after years of sullen, uninspired football, and then nastily snipe him from the pundit box? It smacks of spitefulness and is one of the many reasons why I think all the Alex Ferguson old boys – Scholes, Keane, Ferdinand and Neville – have been absolutely toxic for both punditry and United as an institution. If we must talk about United then let’s talk about United, if we must talk about Barcelona let’s talk about Barcelona, but swiping at Rashford for his bad performances last season just drags down the conversation. I would expect better from a man of Scholes’ age.",
      "Correct opinion? Maybe. I don’t think so personally, but that’s not really the point. Why does it actually need to be said, is the real question. Does it enlighten the fans? Does it explain United’s struggles this season? Does it explain Barcelona’s success? No. It’s just meaningless negativity, like so much of modern football.",
      "It also is yet another example of United old boys finding a way to tear down a young black man no matter the situation. Every single time. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, this mail is long enough as is.\nSamuel, Fulham fan till the end",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "I hope you are all well (or at least caffeinated). I just read two recent F365 takes on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Let me save you some time: I don’t care whether Rashford sulked at Manchester United.",
      "Before you throw a tomato at me for lack of nuance, allow me to explain:",
      "1. Sulking is a spectator’s hobby",
      "If a player is walking, moody, whispering dire oaths in the tunnel — I’ll raise an eyebrow, maybe tweet (sorry X) about it, but I’m not launching moral crusades. Football is messy. Players are people. Sometimes they sulk. Big deal.",
      "2. Would you want to play in the current Manchester United team?",
      "Let me ask you this, dear reader: if someone handed you a contract today to play for this Manchester United — the board, the chaos, the constant managerial churning, the pressure to be more myth than person — would you take it?",
      "Because spare me the nostalgia of “United would have done this” — the United of today is a far cry from the Fergie glory years.",
      "3. Rashford is doing well at Barça",
      "While some are busy flinging “disgrace” accusations, Rashford has started making noise in Barcelona. He’s scoring, contributing, adapting. He’s quieting critics the best way — by playing. And (whisper it) I happen to think that’s more compelling than being praised from my cheap seat at Old Trafford.",
      "4. Even Alex Hunter wouldn’t want to play for Manchester United",
      "Yes, I just dragged a FIFA video game character into this. But hear me out: Alex Hunter (from the FIFA story mode) has tons of dramatic options. If the script handed him the chance to play for Man Utd — under the current regime, under the weight of expectation and instability — I reckon he’d look at his agent and say, “Nah, I’ll play for a mid-tier side and enjoy my life.”",
      "Because even in fantasy land, there’s an escape clause.",
      "So here’s my bottom line: you can publish/ podcast a hundred think-pieces dissecting Rashford’s body language, demeanor, or public statements. But unless you’ve walked in his boots — including the ones he’s now laced up in Barcelona — you should STFU and don’t get to claim moral high ground.\nGaptoothfreak, Man. Utd. fan with too much time, New York",
      "",
      "Long, long time reader of 2 decades. Occasional letter writer.",
      "I wrote in last year about how the site is actively trying to generate managerial sackings and drama, to create negative narratives about clubs, managers and players. For clicks I assume, and instead of analytical articles that are harder to write. The standard of writing has fallen a long way.",
      "I have a 15 year old daughter who has a longer concentration span, and is less fickle and emotional,  more mature . The knee jerking and need to create a story is a far cry from earlier years, where there was mature reporting and genuine humour.",
      "Now we have a site that is essentially a list of top 10s. “Next manager to be sacked“,  “Top 10 replacements for Ange”. A couple of bad results and the narrative begins “X is under pressure”.",
      "Ange has had 4 games. 4 away games. He had a couple days before the Arsenal game, so essentially 3 games. All away. 2 draws where they dominated. Let’s start building an Ange out narrative, spread it across social media until it reaches fans who put pressure on the owner and he pulls the trigger so you can say “we were right”.",
      "He won a major trophy, got Spurs into the CL. Recruited a large number of excellent players. Such is the poor attention span and need for instant gratification people are now disregarding a 5th place finish in his first season. He got lucky at the start of the season apparently. Trying to paint him as though he’s a village idiot. There was a zero percent chance of Spurs going down at any time, and he knew it, so switched attention to CL qualification.",
      "Would fans rather win a trophy or finish 8th? Who had a better season last year, Spurs or Villa? One won a trophy they’ll be talking about for generations, qualified for the CL. Would you rather finish 6- 8th every year, play conservatively and have a cup run?",
      "Oh, and now apparently Emery, the golden boy of the last 2 seasons is now under pressure after a slow start, according to 365. His last 2 seasons don’t count anymore because of a few poor games.",

      "",
      "Read that Sulivan is considering Bilic as manager with Mark Noble and James Collins as assistants. This beggars belief but perhaps helpfully demonstrates the board’s thought process.",
      "While Nobes and the ginger Brazilian will always be club legends, we all know that the ‘club player to manager role’ route is almost always a complete disaster. And Bilic is conspicuously out of work. So for Sullivan, he thinks “fan favorites, and they are all so thick that this will therefore surely stop the protests, tick, “costs me absolutely nothing”, tick. That’s how shallow and clueless this guy is.",
      "I appreciate that with Moyes, Lopetegui and now Potter, WH fans must have a reputation for complaining about any new manager, but as long as Sullivan is in place using the club as a personal money bank, this is going to go on and on.\nMike, WHU",

      "There was a rare occasion where I agreed with John Nicholson when he bemoaned stats and said we’d turn football “from poetry to maths”.  One of the things that’s especially irritating about the saturation of stats is that the average punter either doesn’t understand them or misuses them, xG being the most obvious example.",
      "xG is pretty meaningless in telling you about how an individual game has gone. A late goalmouth scramble having been under the cosh all game can massively boost a side’s  xG but isn’t reflective of the whole. The stat only becomes relevant when viewed over a sweep of games, and can then be used to tell you trends of many goals a team should be scoring/conceding and whether they’re getting lucky.",
      "Stats can be a useful tool, but they’re ultimately quite boring and especially when being used by a boring person to backup a boring opinion.\nLewis, Busby Way (Le Tissier was wonderful, he’d be dropped on his stats)",
      "",
      "Following news that Gary Neville was pedalling Kane to Chelsea/United instead of Spurs (should he even return to these shores), I found a little bile rising to my throat at the thought of Kane in another English clubs shirt – it’d just be wrong now, no? Not like the weird, yet heart-warming feeling of seeing early Shearer footage in the red and white of the Draper Tools kit – but actually quite horrifying.",
      "Then it gots me to thinking… who could never have worn anything but their last clubs shirt?",
      "I don’t think it’d have bothered me to see Giggs or Scholes wear an Arsenal shirt for example and that’s not an indictment on those two, just, some players would look ghastly in another teams shirt and the initial ones that come to mind are:",
      "Cantona – his year at Leeds was one thing – but imagine if he’d “pulled an Ince” and put on a Liverpool shirt?\nHenry – if he was in England, it had to be Arsenal, surely\nGerrard – imagine him taking a year at Palace before he retired?\nHibbert – an original one-clubber – and he is just EVERTON.\nSlightly left field one to end my starters – Tony Yeboah – that man could NEVER have worn anything other than Leeds Blanco while in Blighty",
      "Arguably the biggest version of “another shirt would be horrifying” would even be abroad… imagine a world where Totti, took a few years with Inter or Juve. Ew.",
      "Thoughts?\nHarold Ernand Hooler",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Every Arsenal game currently seems to be wracked with tension, and a trip to Newcastle will be no different on another Big Weekend.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’."

      "Neither Brentford or Manchester United have been bothered by Carabao Cup or European adventures this midweek. The Bees because they knocked Aston Villa out of the third round last week, and Manchester United because they finished 15th last season, well out of the European places, and were knocked out of the cup by League Two Grimsby. Sorry to go into detail there United fans.",
      "United, and former Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, arrive in west London with a 2-1 win over Chelsea under their belts and plenty of renewed optimism about the way they played, although the Blues keeper getting sent off within the first five minutes played a big part of that.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Brentford already lurk around the positions that most people expected to see them in at the start of the season.",
      "However, their ‘who is dis guy’ manager Keith Andrews is unbeaten at home from his first three games at the Gtech. A league and cup win over Aston Villa, and a last-gasp draw with Chelsea. It’s away from home they’ve struggled, and the poor 3-1 defeat to Fulham last time out will have hurt.",
      "The last time these two sides met in May they played out a 4-3 corker, although United fans will not want to remember how they fell apart to be 4-1 down before staging a late fightback. They’ll also want to forget a 4-0 thrashing in August 2022, three visits ago.",

      "But again, with Brentford incredibly offering up an opportunity for Amorim to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time, when asked by a reporter in the press conference what the key to consistency is for Manchester United, we would advise Amorim against “complete honesty” when it’s an admission of ignorance.",
      "“It is normal that the fans don’t know what is going to happen in the next game. To be completely honest, I have an idea, but I don’t know how it’s going to be and I’m the manager of the team! The best way of dealing with that is every game is the last one.”",
      "We enjoy self-deprecation as much as anyone, and understand that it’s no more than a jovial, throwaway comment from a man under pressure; someone quite frankly embarrassed that after ten months in charge of one of the biggest clubs in world football he’s yet to win two league games on the bounce.",

      "No Manchester United fan will be turning up for this clash at Brentford tomorrow with any clue as to how their team perform on a scale from not bad to terrible, but should the manager not have more than “an idea”? Or at least put the brutal honesty on hold and claim that he does?",

      "We must be honest and concede that it’s not quite as chunky a Big Weekend as the last couple, but it’s another where the fixture computer’s capriciousness could leave Arsenal again fearing the worst and playing catch-up at a ground with bad recent memories for Arteta and co.",
      "Meanwhile every weekend is Big for Big Ange Postecoglou as he has another stab at getting a first win to go with all the lovely attacking football he’s got Forest playing now.",
      "And in not unrelated news, beleaguered Wolves head to London hoping for a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "We once again find ourselves with some degree of sympathy for Arsenal and the machinations of the fixture computer. Liverpool once again have first-mover advantage on a weekend when Arsenal’s task is a difficult one.",
      "Liverpool have no penalty kick themselves at Selhurst Park, but if they can win – via late shirt-removing methods or otherwise – then Arsenal face another Sunday afternoon when any slight slip will come with outsized consequences.",
      "Arsenal could be eight points adrift by the time they kick off at a stadium where their recent record is not good. Arsenal lost twice at St James’ Park last season without scoring a goal, in the league and again in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, extending a record in Newcastle that now reads one win and four defeats on their last five visits.",
      "For Newcastle, this game represents a test of what has been a few weeks of tentative promise since the cruel late defeat to Liverpool. That was a game that featured 83 per cent of all goals scored in Premier League games involving Newcastle this season. Three of their other four games have finished goalless, along with a 1-0 home win over hapless Wolves.",
      "This is a game that should give a pretty clear indication of whether the last few weeks have represented recovery and growth, or just not playing any of the top teams for a bit. At least domestically; there was plenty of encouragement too in a narrow Champions League defeat to Barcelona.",
      "The fact Liverpool have already won here adds another dash of intrigue and jeopardy for Arsenal; it already feels like an achievement that even at this early stage they must match. And a game where all evidence from Newcastle’s efforts outside that Liverpool defeat suggest Mikel Arteta will simply have to release that infamous handbrake of his.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure how much longer Viktor Gyokeres scoring the wrong kind of goals is going to keep providing a covering narrative for the fact the big-money striker Man United chose after missing out on the Swede still doesn’t have any goals, at all, against anyone up to and including Grimsby Town.",
      "Sesko played the full 90 minutes of that match before infamously stepping up as the last outfield player to take a penalty for United in the dignity-sapping shoot-out that followed.",
      "While he’s been more sporadically used in the Premier League, he has nevertheless now played a tick under 300 minutes of football for United without a goal or assist to his name.",
      "It’s not Sesko’s fault that United paid what they paid for him, nor that he is the latest pawn in the wider United banter circus.",
      "But he’s going to need to start helping himself soon, and a Saturday lunchtime trip to a hollowed-out Brentford side who have shipped seven goals in their last three Premier League games represents just about as good a chance as any at this point.",
      "If anything, has the great man’s start at Nottingham Forest perhaps been too Postecoglou? We really don’t want to complain, or indeed to appear greedy and ungrateful, but it has felt like all the key elements of Postecoglou’s football have been crammed into the last few weeks.",
      "Forest have started playing some truly gorgeous attacking football, and some truly catastrophic defensive football. They have failed to defend leads against teams as diverse as Swansea, Burnley and Real Betis, while the hamstring injuries that plagued Big Ange’s riotously entertaining two years at Tottenham are already making an unwanted appearance in Nottingham.",
      "Sunderland at home would have been a fixture most teams were chalking up as three points when the computer spat out the schedule back in June, but a lot has changed for both Sunderland and Forest since then.",
      "It’s an awkwardly big game now for Postecoglou, with last weekend’s failure to put Burnley away exacerbated by the same failing in the Europa League in midweek.",
      "There are many reasons why Postecoglou is currently a fixture in the manager to watch slot. One, it’s just pretty much always entertaining and who doesn’t enjoy that? But a second reason is the clear and certain sense that we should enjoy it while we can, because it doesn’t feel likely that Angeball is back on any kind of long-term basis.",
      "We’re not yet in must-win territory, even for Mr Marinakis, but there is a sense of ‘if not now, when?’ about Postecoglou’s quest for a first victory with his new club. After Sunderland, it’s Midtjylland and Newcastle before the October international break and Chelsea, Porto, Bournemouth, Manchester United, Sturm Graz, Leeds, Liverpool and Malmo before the end of November.",
      "Manchester United should provide few problems, given Postecoglou’s formline there, but with the rest of that run of games it doesn’t require a vivid imagination to picture it all spiralling rapidly out of control.",
      "",
      "Five defeats to begin the Premier League season, which extends Vitor Pereira’s side’s overall winless league run to nine vexing matches since the giddy spring days of winning six in a row.",
      "With Wolves’ own deep woes and a squad left woefully under-powered after a difficult summer exacerbated by clear signs of life at all three promoted clubs, you already find yourself wondering how much longer the club can afford to wait before taking decisive action to arrest the slide and save their season.",
      "It feels wild to be talking this way given just how adroitly Pereira steered Wolves out of trouble back in March and April, but the drop-off has been gargantuan and the context of that six-game winning run starting to look slightly different.",
      "It was a run that featured all three relegated sides as well as West Ham, Manchester United and Tottenham who were very much the worst of the non-relegated teams in the second half of last season.",
      "Six straight wins is still six straight wins, but there has to be some acknowledgement they came against the six easiest possible opponents with very little scope for hope or optimism since.",
      "Until now. It’s Spurs again for Wolves this weekend and, while they do look a very different and less banterous beast under Thomas Frank, they are still Tottenham. The Doctor will see you now.",
      "",
      "A key midlands derby between two teams with clear Premier League ambitions, Coventry having lost out in the play-offs in two out of the last three seasons while remaining unbeaten in the Championship this season under Frank Lampard, and Birmingham’s targeting of back-to-back promotions back to the big time long since certain to be one of the EFL’s key talking points this season.",
      "Coventry could do with turning draws into wins, while Birmingham are still yet to truly settle on their best XI in a brave new world, yet both can be reasonably content with how things are shaping up, both reaching ten points after six games to sit in and around the play-off spots at this early stage.",
      "",
      "The two Madrid giants have made wildly contrasting starts in La Liga thus far, with Real Madrid currently boasting a flawless 18 points from their opening six games but Atleti managing only half that.",
      "They needed a late Julian Alvarez-inspired comeback to see off Rayo Vallecano at home in midweek, while their Champions League campaign got off to a gut-wrenching start at Liverpool the week before.",
      "It doesn’t quite feel like the ideal time to be facing their big noisy neighbours, where things are currently progressing so serenely they didn’t even feel the need to have a hissy fit about the Ballon d’Or this time.",
      "",
      "There is no imaginable football where this isn’t a big game, albeit that as far as the women’s game is currently concerned the balance of power lies rather differently to the men’s. United have made a fine start to the new WSL season after a pair of handsome wins over Leicester and London City and a creditable goalless draw against Arsenal.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, still await their first point after a humbling Merseyside Derby defeat to Everton and then going down at Leicester after the hosts were reduced to 10 early in the second half.",
      "Sunderland have won at Nottingham Forest, who remain winless under Ange Postecoglou. His appointment is somehow going worse than anyone expected.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft."

      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Manchester United remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Man Utd made a late move for Baleba, 21, in the summer transfer window after spending over £200million on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There have been reports of Liverpool competing with the Red Devils for Baleba’s signature, but transfer expert Jacobs poured cold water on that.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder. Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder,” he told The United Stand.",
      "Jacobs added that Man Utd did a lot of “legwork” in August, making it very unlikely they will walk away from their pursuit of Baleba next year.",
      "“One of the reasons they (Man Utd) did all the legwork over the final weeks of the window was to try and put themselves in the strongest possible position, because I think they will be moving for Carlos Baleba,” he continued.",
      "MORE: Man Utd choose ‘elite’ manager as ‘prime candidate’ to replace Amorim amid two reasons for verdict",
      "“You don’t commit to what would have been potentially a 100 million-plus spend and then just walk away, because there’ll be a point in 12 months’ time where that player is for sale.",
      "“Even though many may feel 100 million is a lot of money, and something that could get a deal done, Brighton’s data and approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moises Caicedo-type fee, 115 million or more in 12 months’ time.",
      "“That projection of value effectively priced Baleba out of the market and stopped anybody bidding, because Brighton felt no one is going to match the valuation, and therefore the player is simply not for sale.",
      "“So if Manchester United want Carlos Baleba, but they don’t have to worry about Liverpool or anyone else, they have to worry about probably finding 100-plus million, maybe even closer to 115 or 120 million, hoping that Brighton want to sell, which is far more likely in a year’s time.",
      "“If it isn’t Liverpool, there’ll be other suitors for Baleba, and that’s the whole point really. Brighton think that, first of all, in a year’s time there’ll be multiple suitors, so the price goes up. Second of all, form, hopefully, from Brighton’s point of view in the next 12 months, also adds to the valuation.",
      "“With Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. So could it be Baleba and [Adam] Wharton, or two other senior midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, because Casemiro could still depart, even though he’s found favour under Ruben Amorim. Second of all, because Bruno Fernandes could go off to Saudi Arabia, and that could fund the window in 12 months’ time.”",
      "Asked if Man Utd could bid for Baleba in January, Jacobs quickly quashed the idea.",
      "“I don’t see a January sale for Carlos Baleba, that’s the first thing to say,” he said.",
      "“The start to the season may have been influenced by some of the summer speculation. There’s no doubt his head was turned by Manchester United, but we’re so early in the season, I don’t think we can equate a dip in form with a dip in valuation, or a dip in form with a January exit.",
      "“Brighton have shown with several players that they sell when they want to, based on their own long-term plan, and the only thing that may alter the Baleba situation is the fact that David Weir unexpectedly left, and Jason Ayto, the former Arsenal interim sporting director, has come in. So there’s a new voice and consideration over what they do in the market.",
      "“But remember, January is very much a seller’s market. It’s difficult for buyers in a short space of time, and it’s mid-season, and we know Brighton’s approach is to sell on their terms, their timeline, their price.",
      "“In addition to that, with a replacement coming in — all of which would be hard to do in a January window — it would be a big shock if Baleba went anywhere in January. But I also think it’d be equally as big a shock if Brighton didn’t engage more seriously over a summer sale, because these players, when they join Brighton, know there will be a period in time where they can be sold and move on to another club.",
      "“With Baleba, the feeling is that if you look at the whole season, rather than just these first few games, come the end of the season, Brighton feel his valuation will be even higher than the number that they put over his head privately, but not to Manchester United.”",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’."

      "Sunday 28 September 2025 08:39, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",

      "United were 2-1 down as Fernandes waited more than four minutes to take his second-half spot-kick which was eventually saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after VAR checked if Nathan Collins should have been sent off for denying Bryan Mbeumo a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson's decision to book Collins was upheld, without him being sent to the monitor, despite the Brentford defender making no clear attempt to play the ball when pulling his former team-mate back by the shoulder.",
      "Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.\n\n\nIn all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.",
      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",
      "Fernandes' second failure from the spot this season ultimately cost United, who are now winless in their last eight away league games and back in the bottom half as Brentford climb above them thanks to a richly deserved three points.",

      "Amorim disagreed with the decision not to send off Collins but said his team should have done more to manage the game after Fernandes failed to convert his penalty.",
      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",
      "Asked if he felt it was an area to target, Andrews said: \"It's the natural way you prepare for games. You try and create overloads. One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in then they have a four.",
      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",
