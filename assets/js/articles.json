      "Former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney claims he would find it \"frustrating\" playing under Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim. Rooney, 39, believes Amorim's penchant for shifting players around the pitch throughout games would ultimately leave him feeling \"fed up\".",
      "United's lacklustre start to the season continued on Sunday as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Fulham at Craven Cottage. Leny Yoro's header, deflecting in off Fulham's Rodrigo Muniz, saw United open the scoring after Bruno Fernandes had skied a penalty over the bar. However, United's goal was later cancelled out by Emile Smith Rowe.",
      "United's forward line endured a difficult and inconsistent afternoon as they were moved from their preferred positions as the game advanced. Mason Mount eventually dropped deep into midfield to make way for new recruit Benjamin Sesko up top.",
      "New signing Matheus Cunha, initially deployed as a striker, found himself later playing in between the lines as Amorim looked eager to find a solution to his misfiring side. Rooney, speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show, believes being moved around the pitch to suit different formations can ultimately have an adverse effect on players.",
      "\"The one thing, players are getting moved around the pitch, shifted into different positions,\" Rooney said. \"You see Mason Mount playing two or three positions. Cunha, [Bryan] Mbeumo, Amad [Diallo] – players are moving into different positions and from that you can't get a settled run in the team of doing the same thing and one thing.",
      "\"I know as a player who did that, it can be very frustrating and all of a sudden you become fed up of it and that shows through body language as well. I just hope that doesn't start to happen with these new players because I think there's a lot of ability in there already early on.\"",
      "While Cunha hit the post, £71million man Mbeumo struggled to impact the game. Another of United's new signings, Sesko, also failed to make his presence felt with the Slovenian not even registering a shot on goal.",
      "After the game, Amorim defended his new trio. “It was a tough match, and when we scored the goal we forgot about maintaining the way we play and tried to maintain the result. We want to win so bad,” Amorim said.",
      "“He (Sesko) needs time. It’s not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast. He is learning [that] the game is faster than the Bundesliga but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "However, United's £73m signing from RB Leipzig did face the wrath of another former United star in Gary Neville, after the 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "Neville also echoed Rooney's concerns that Amorim's chopping and changing on the pitch had a negative impact on United. Neville added: “The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team.",
      "\"But I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "As Ruben Amorim grapples with his goalkeeping dilemma at Manchester United, he could do worse than heed the wisdom Sir Alex Ferguson shared with Sean Dyche. Today, goalkeepers are expected to start attacks and maintain possession with their feet, while Ferguson solely concentrated on how his No. 1s were able to stop goals going in.",
      "Altay Bayindir once more looked shaky during United's 1-1 away draw with Fulham when dealing with the Cottagers' set-pieces. It mirrored his struggles against Arsenal seven days earlier.",
      "Nevertheless, he showcased his distribution skills when he released Matheus Cunha with a thunderous long ball, with the Brazilian's attempt being expertly thwarted by Cottagers keeper Bernd Leno.",
      "Impressive as this was, Ferguson, during a private chat with Dyche after a previous meeting between Burnley and United, insisted the primary concern for keepers should be preventing goals and dealing with crosses, rather than fancy footwork.",
      "Given Bayindir and Andre Onana have both looked uncertain under Amorim, who is reportedly eyeing a swoop for Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens, the United head coach might be wise to follow Ferguson's counsel when making his next goalkeeping call.",
      "Speaking on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, Dyche revealed details of a discussion he'd had with the legendary United chief regarding his former Burnley keeper Nick Pope, now of Newcastle. Dyche said: \"Different managers want different things. They were questioning Nick Pope, I couldn't believe it.",
      "\"They were questioning him about his playing [with his feet], saying, 'Oh yeah, but he can't do this and he can't do that.' Sir Alex Ferguson always invites you up to his room there. When we (Burnley) played United, Nick Pope was playing terrific. I think we drew the game and he was coming out, taking crosses, terrific.",
      "\"He was the monster player that he is, great player for me, great goalkeeper. Sir Alex, he said, 'Oh he's a big boy and he does this,' and I said, 'Yeah, they keep going on about his feet.'",
      "\"He said, 'Feet? He stops the ball going in the net. People said that about [Edwin] van der Sar. That (ability with his feet) was a bonus. Van der Sar could handle and he could stop the ball going in the net. The rest of it was a bonus.'",
      "\"That's old guard by the way, but call it how it is. I'm not going against modern coaching, trust me, I know all the terminology and that's fine. But sometimes the simplicity is, his job is to stop the ball going into the net.",
      "\"Brian Clough used to say to his centre halves, 'Head it, and kick it, and give it to someone who is better than you – and that's everyone.' The basics are still the basics, that was Sir Alex's point, and Nick Pope stops it going in the goal.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag, Amorim's predecessor at United, didn't heed this advice when he splashed the cash on Onana, a keeper known for his footwork and creativity, to replace David de Gea. However, Onana's shot-stopping and handling skills have been found wanting at Old Trafford.",
      "With United said to be nearing a potential agreement over signing Lammens, it seems neither Bayindir nor Onana feature in Amorim's long-term plans. Given the shortcomings of both keepers, the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss might do well to ensure Lammens can handle the basics, much like Ferguson did with Van der Sar.",

      "Ruben Amorim needs to put on specific extra training sessions for goalkeeper Altay Bayindir or Manchester United’s game plan will continue to be undermined at set pieces. That’s the opinion of Rio Ferdinand, who was concerned by what he saw in their 1-1 draw with Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Amorim opted to continue with Bayindir as his starting goalkeeper at Craven Cottage, with Andre Onana on the substitutes’ bench. Having been at fault for Riccardo Calafiori’s goal in the 1-0 loss against Arsenal on the opening weekend, the Turkey international’s struggles continued.",
      "Bayindir struggled to assert himself from set pieces as Fulham tried to copy Arsenal’s tactics and target him. Although they managed not to concede from a set piece on Sunday, Ferdinand is worried and thinks action needs to be taken on the training pitch.",
      "“We look shaky. The goalkeeper doesn’t fill me with massive confidence,” he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel. “I’ve got to be honest with you, he made a great save in the game from Joshua King, when he came out with his feet, he did really well there.",
      "“But from set pieces, even outside of the goal, he’s coming for things that are 50-50 and he’s not sure. The whole backline doesn't look good in that area, not just the goalkeeper to be honest with you.”",
      "Ferdinand added: “He needs to liven up. I know that, definitely. I’ll tell you what I’d do, I’d be getting him out on the pitch every day and smashing balls under the crossbar.",
      "“He’s got to get used to it, he’s got to get used to contact and work out a way. Make sure the referee is aware by the way that there’s going to be contact. Shout, get him aware to look at you so if there’s any contact, like in the Fulham game, that you get the free-kick.",
      "“I don’t think he talks enough, he doesn’t make people aware of what’s going on and then his decision-making in those moments hasn’t been good enough.",
      "“I don’t think he’s seen enough of that, Declan Rice whipping balls right under his nose. He’s not on his own by the way in lacking a bit of confidence.”",
      "United are in talks to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, but it is unclear where the 23-year-old would end up in the pecking order. Onana was United’s No.1 choice last season, but had to overcome an injury in pre-season and lost his place to Bayindir.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been branded 'embarrassing beyond belief' for 'crying' about the referee bumping into him before his missed penalty against Fulham. Fernandes, 30, had a golden opportunity to put Manchester United ahead at Craven Cottage on Sunday after the Red Devils were awarded a penalty for a foul on Mason Mount.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder placed the ball down from 12 yards and as he began walking backwards to his mark, referee Chris Kavanagh got in Fernandes' way and the pair collided. United's captain was visibly frustrated with Kavanagh and went on to sky his penalty over the crossbar, just the seventh time that he's missed a spot-kick in his career.",
      "When the teams came back out for the second half, Fernandes was seen in conversation with the referee and appeared to still be complaining. After United could only manage a 1-1 draw, the 30-year-old stressed that the bump wasn't an 'excuse' for his miss but he was upset that Kavanagh hadn't apologised for getting in his way.",
      "That didn't wash with Craig Burley, though. The ex-Chelsea star, known for his straight-talking style of punditry, fired at Fernandes with both barrels.",
      "\"I want to talk about the captain,\" Burley began on ESPN. \"What a whingy, whiny, little moaning pain in the butt. What an embarrassment, what an embarrassment to a professional footballer.",
      "\"The referee inadvertently nudged him as he was backing off the penalty and he made out the referee has basically run into him. What a big kid.",
      "\"Any player worth his salt would have laughed that off and taken the penalty and yet he whined and moaned and cried, as he does, about something so innocuous. It was embarrassing.",
      "\"A lot of his career at United has been good but there's been a sideshow as well and that encapsulated it for me. I thought it was embarrassing beyond belief.",
      "\"How does that put you off your routine? He made such a song and dance about it that it became the story. I thought it was beyond embarrassing, it was childish, school playground stuff. It beggars belief, it really does.\"",
      "Fernandes gave his side of the story post-match, explaining: \"I was upset. As a penalty taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do.",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty. I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too [far] under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",

      "Rio Ferdinand has expressed his surprise that Jamie Vardy hasn't signed for Wrexham after ruling out the possibility of him moving to Manchester United. The former England striker has been without a club since leaving Leicester City at the end of last season.",
      "Vardy has been linked to numerous clubs over the summer, including the likes of Everton, Celtic and Rangers. More recently, there has been speculation that he could be heading for the MLS with Inter Miami or Serie A with Napoli, but the 38-year-old is still unattached.",
      "Wrexham, owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, have also been connected with a swoop for the veteran free agent following their promotion to the Championship in April. And United legend Ferdinand is amazed that Vardy, who scored 200 goals in 500 games for the Foxes, hasn't arrived in North Wales following a period of big spending by the Red Dragons.",
      "There have also been rumours during the transfer window that he could end up at Old Trafford as a back-up striker. However, Ferdinand believes it would be the wrong move for both parties, with Vardy understood to be keen for regular game time and United in need of players who will have a guaranteed impact up front.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Presents YouTube channel, the ex-England international said: \"As much as I love Jamie Vardy and I respect everything he's done in the game, he's not what Man United need right now. He's just gone a bit too far over the hill to really be able to impact the team.",
      "\"You can't bring someone in just to impact the changing room. He isn't going to want to come there and just sit down and just chill. He wants to play football, with the type of person he is. As much as he's got experience, it's just not the right time.",
      "\"I can't believe he's not signed for Wrexham. Right now, I just think it would probably be more harmful for Vardy to come here [to Man Utd] for himself than it would benefit us.\"",
      "Vardy recently spoke out after two of his former Leicester teammates signed for Wrexham this summer with deals agreed for goalkeeper Danny Ward and defender Conor Coady. The pair have so far started in all three of the club's league games as they look to establish themselves in the second tier.",
      "Writing on Instagram after Coady's switch was confirmed, Vardy said: \"All the best brother. What a player and person.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",
      "Available every Wednesday, it provides all the insights you need to be a top red. And for a limited time, a subscription to 'Wrexham is the Game' will cost fans just £15 for the first year.",
      "Sign up for Wrexham is the Game here",
      "As it stands, it would raise eyebrows if Wrexham did make a move for Vardy having already brought in ten new faces so far this summer, including several attackers. Manager Phil Parkinson has signed strikers Kieffer Moore and Ryan Hardie from Sheffield United and Plymouth Argyle respectively.",
      "Forwards Josh Windass and Nathan Broadhead have also joined to bolster Wrexham's frontline. The Red Dragons have so far secured just one point from their opening three Championship fixtures after drawing 2-2 with Sheffield Wednesday at home on Saturday.",
      "Parkinson's side's face another tough challenge in their next league match as they travel to Millwall at the weekend.",

      "Alan Shearer believes Ruben Amorim could find himself under huge pressure if Manchester United stumble against Burnley this weekend. United's campaign has begun inauspiciously - something Amorim can ill-afford to let drag on.",
      "They lost 1-0 to Arsenal on the opening day before dropping points again in a 1-1 draw against Fulham on Sunday. Coming off the back of a miserable 2024/25 season, another slip-up could be devastating for the manager, which is why Shearer views Saturday's 3pm clash as a must-win.",
      "\"They [United] are one of the teams that have to start winning pretty soon, otherwise the pressure will mount, hugely. There's no doubt about it,\" the Newcastle icon said on The Rest is Football podcast.",
      "\"They've got Burnley next. That's one of those games where you probably want it, but if you don't win it then it really does mount the pressure. So they've got to win that one at home, there's no doubt about it.\"",
      "Before they face Burnley, United will visit Grimsby Town on Wednesday in the EFL Cup second round. Normally, that would provide an opportunity to shuffle the line-up and give fringe players some game-time, but anything other than a convincing win over the League Two outfit would pile more pressure onto Amorim's shoulders.",
      "The game might also be used to inject confidence into the club's new attacking trio. Over £200million was spent this summer on Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, and Bryan Mbeumo - none of whom have registered a goal or assist yet.",
      "Cunha came closest, rattling the post against Fulham and forcing David Raya into a fine stop against Arsenal. Mbeumo has looked lively too, nearly scoring with an audacious bicycle kick against the Gunners.",
      "The key, however, may be getting Sesko firing. The £74m striker arrived from RB Leipzig earlier this month, and expectations are high. The club is keen to avoid a repeat of Rasmus Hojlund's struggles; after arriving for a comparable sum in 2023, the Dane quickly lost confidence and his form collapsed.",
      "In Premier League history, United have opened a campaign without victory in their first three matches only three times. On two occasions they still managed to go and win the title.",
      "The last instance was in 2014/15 under Louis van Gaal, when defeats and draws to Swansea, Sunderland, and Burnley left them reeling. Amorim, embarking on his first full season in charge, will be desperate to avoid a similar fate.",
      "Recent results against Burnley offer some hope: United are unbeaten in seven, winning five, and have lost to the Clarets just twice since the late 1960s. Still, history will offer little comfort if they don't walk away with all three points this weekend.",
      "The Burnley clash arrives just before the first international break, and United will be anxious to go into it on a high. Anything short of a victory could sour the atmosphere dramatically – perhaps enough to put Amorim's job in real danger.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "But he has failed to kick on under his successor Ruben Amorim, who has preferred Casemiro in midfield and has dropped Mainoo for the first two Premier League games of the season.",

      "Manchester United have three midfielders on their wishlist, but no deals are in the pipeline as the summer transfer window deadline approaches. United have spent over £200million this summer to improve their front line, but problems persist in midfield.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all arrived this summer as Ruben Amorim tries to address their meagre attacking returns. United managed just 44 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and therefore prioritised overhauling their attack.",
      "However, their 1-0 defeat by Arsenal and 1-1 draw against Fulham has shown that Amorim still has an issue in central midfield. He has fielded Casemiro alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in both games, but the balance has been lacking.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been an unused substitute in both matches and is considering his future ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline. Mason Mount shifted into central midfield at Craven Cottage before Manuel Ugarte took on the holding role from Casemiro.",
      "Amorim does not see Mainoo as No.6 midfielder and says that the academy graduate is instead an alternative for Fernandes. United could therefore be tempted to cash in on Mainoo, who would be helpful from a profit and sustainability perspective, given he is a homegrown player.",
      "He might need to be sold for a new midfielder to be signed, given that the pursuit of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is the current priority. Amorim is keen to add an athletic and dynamic No.6 to his squad and United have three names on their radar.",
      "The Athletic reports that Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Sporting Lisbon’s Morten Hjulmand are all admired at the club. However, United have given up trying to sign Baleba, due to Brighton’s sky-high £120m valuation, while their interest in Wharton and Hjulmund is also not developed at this stage.",
      "Hjulmand is extremely well known to Amorim, who worked with the Sporting captain during his time with the club, winning two Primeira Liga titles and the Taca de Portugal. The 26-year-old is reportedly available for around £50m, two years after signing from Lecce for just £15m.",
      "Wharton has four years left on his contract with Palace, who are unwilling to sell this summer after losing Eberechi Eze to Arsenal and with Marc Guehi potentially heading to Liverpool. The 21-year-old has caught the eye of scouts from rival Premier League sides and United would face competition if they did move for him.",
      "The focus at United before the window is on offloading their unwanted players, with Alejandro Garnacho in talks over a move to Chelsea, Rasmus Hojlund being eyed by Napoli, RB Leipzig and Atalanta. Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were all put in the ‘bomb squad’ by Amorim earlier this summer but remain contracted players as the clock ticks down.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lamine Yamal has been warned to block out all distractions by former wonderkid Freddy Adu. The 18-year-old has shone over recent seasons having made his Barcelona debut during the 2022/23 season.",
      "He has gone on to make 108 appearances for the Catalan giants and enjoyed his best season so far last term with 18 goals to his name. In that time, Yamal has won two La Liga crowns and the Copa del Rey.",
      "The teenager has also earned international recognition having won the Euros with Spain only last summer. But he has been warned that the spotlight could bring some unwanted attention.",
      "Adu - who had a trial at Manchester United as a youngster - has urged Yamal to keep his feet firmly on the ground. Adu, speaking via an online betting site, said: “So obviously all eyes are on him all the time, and that's hard. That's really hard. For me personally, I couldn't just be a regular kid, and this is coming from someone in America and in the States, football isn't even the biggest sport here!",
      "“Yet I was going through that. I can't even imagine how it is for him over there in Spain. It's probably just magnified 1000 times, because that is the national sport.",
      "“He plays for the biggest team, it's the national sport, everywhere he goes, everything he does; all eyes are on him. And that's hard. As a young player, when you're put in a situation like that, it's just very, very difficult to handle.”",
      "Asked how Yamal would be best served adapting to his new-found fame, he replied: “My advice would be for him to just put his head down, train and just focus on his craft. Because there will be a lot of distractions. And I'm sure there is right now.",
      "“I mean, there's been some stuff in the newspapers that I've seen where he was with a woman that was way older than he was or whatever, on vacation and whatnot, and everybody's talking about it. Every little thing he does is going to be talked about.",
      "“If you’re going to go on holiday with an older woman just make sure the only person you go with is your mother! Because at this point, no matter what you it’s going to get talked about, and it's a lot of distractions. So you don't want to make let that become your whole narrative surrounding you as a player. You don't want that. You wanted to be focused on the field.",
      "\"When I was young, I made a lot of mistakes. I was young, and I made mistakes. I hung out with some friends and somebody took a picture of me out at a party or whatever, and it became a big deal. I didn't think it was, but it became a big deal. And then the narrative becomes that you're not focused on your game, that you're just out here hanging out with your friends and party.”",
      "Barcelona have enjoyed a perfect start to the season, with Yamal having already found the net. He will be aiming to extend that form this weekend with a trip to Rayo Vallecano.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "New signing Benjamin Sesko is still waiting for his first start, having come off the bench in both league matches. However, fellow summer arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo both started against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Next up for United is a League Cup trip to Grimsby, followed by a home league game against Burnley. Amorim will be targeting victories in both games to kick-start the season, while the three attackers to move to Old Trafford this summer will all be aiming to get among the goals.",
      "One area where investment may be needed is in goal. Altay Bayindir hasn't wholly convinced during the first two games of the season, and progress appears to be being made over Sanne Lammens.",
      "Scott McTominay has attempted to convince Rasmus Hojlund to join Napoli, according to reports in Italy. The latest indication from Corriere dello Sport is that McTominay's talks have been successful and Hojlund is now close to making the switch.",
      "The Danish international striker enjoyed a steady first start at Old Trafford but struggled in front of goal last season. He has yet to feature this term, in part due to Sesko's arrival, with Napoli and AC Milan both keen.",
      "Napoli have money to spend after selling Victor Osimhen to Galatasaray in July. If he heads to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Hojlund would find himself linking up with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne following the Belgian's early summer switch.",
      "Jadon Sancho has not said no to Roma, according to the Italian club's manager Gian Piero Gasperini. Reports earlier in the window suggested Sancho had no plans to join the Giallorossi, but this appears far from certain.",
      "“Sancho never said no to Roma,” Gasperini told Italian broadcaster RAI (via Football Italia). However, the Italian side still have work to do if the winger is to join.",
      "Bayern Munich have also been linked with a move for Sancho, though reports from Germany over the weekend suggested that move doesn't look likely. Bayern started their Bundesliga campaign with a 6-0 victory over RB Leipzig, with wide men Michael Olise and Luis Diaz among the scorers.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is open to the idea of leaving Manchester United this summer, according to talkSPORT. The midfielder broke into United's first team under Erik ten Hag but has found action harder to come by with Ruben Amorim at the helm.",
      "The 20-year-old was an unused substitute for United's first two games of the season, with Casemiro partnering Bruno Fernandes in the middle. He also started on the bench in the final two league games of the 2024-25 season and was restricted to late cameos in the semis and final of the Europa League.",
      "Chelsea were previously linked with Mainoo, a product of United's academy. His current contract runs until 2027, but it has been suggested United would need a sizeable offer if they are going to cash in.",

      "However, he has struggled to make much of an impact at Old Trafford, managing just 26 goals in 95 appearances across all competitions. United have strengthened their attack significantly this summer and Hojlund has been deemed surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",

      "Hojlund will be hoping he can find some form in Italy, having insisted during United's pre-season tour of the US that he wanted to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford. \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said.",

      "Manchester United benefited from two incorrect refereeing decisions in their draw against Fulham on Sunday, according to ex-Premier League referee Mark Halsey.",
      "United drew 1-1 at Craven Cottage in a game dominated by contentious decisions by the officials. The away side should have taken advantage of a penalty call in their favour, but Bruno Fernandes blazed his effort over the crossbar.",
      "Referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot after VAR sent him to the pitchside monitor to watch an incident from a corner. Fulham defender Calvin Bassey was adjudged to have fouled United midfielder Mason Mount by throwing him to the floor.",
      "Halsey believes that the VAR did not need to send Kavanagh to review the incident because there was a foul by a United player which cancelled things out. He also thinks that United got away with a foul when Leny Yoro’s header went in off Rodrigo Muniz to put them 1-0 up.",
      "“As well as Bassey on Mount, you must also look at Luke Shaw on Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz as both incidents happened simultaneously,” Halsey wrote for The Sun.",
      "“I do not know why he was called over. Even when Kavanagh went over to the screen, he was there for quite some time looking at it. There are two incidents, so which one is the more serious? The referee should have just played on. They cancel each other out.",
      "“You can understand why Marco Silva has gone ballistic because for United’s goal, you can see a clear push from Leny Yoro on Bassey. So why is that not disallowed?”",
      "Gary Lineker made a similar point when discussing the decision and how it is communicated to fans on the Rest is Football podcast. He said: \"They got a penalty, which my goodness, what a bizarre experience. You know, going to the game, we're watching the game, there's a corner and then the ball's cleared, the ball goes up to the other end of the pitch and Fulham's on the attack.",
      "\"Then suddenly the ref stops and you're thinking, 'What's going on here?' Now, I know the experience is probably different at home, but if you're in the ground, Oh my. Then you look at, you see a sign saying VAR penalty check. And I was honestly sitting there and I said 'For which team, who to?'",
      "\"I didn't even know whether it was that end or that end, and you had no idea what was going on. I mean, it's such an awful experience for fans.\"",

      "Sancho has been part of Amorim's \"Bomb Squad\" of unwanted players at Old Trafford this summer, alongside Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford - who has since sealed a loan move to Barcelona.",
      "But despite a concerted effort to find a new club, interest from sides like Borussia Dortmund and Juventus has failed to materialise, leaving Sancho in no man's land.",
      "Sancho has received interest from Roma in recent weeks, though talks have stalled amid reports that the England winger is not interested in switching to the Italian capital.",
      "However, Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport claims Sancho has not officially turned them down but adds the player has \"hesitations\" over the move - which is \"tormenting\" the Serie A club.",
      "It adds that United chief Jason Wilcox is \"desperate\" to clear Sancho off their wage bill given that he earns around £250,000-a-week at Old Trafford, with the club agreeing a transfer of £15m around a month ago.",
      "Sancho has reportedly been asked to make his mind up on a Roma move by Wednesday before the club move on to other targets. Currently, there are no other clubs weighing up a bid to sign the ex-Borussia Dortmund star.",
      "Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini insisted after his side's win over Bologna this weekend that Sancho had not rejected them.",
      "\"Sancho never said no to Roma,' he said. There are eight days left. This is a good team, anyway. As I said before, there's no end to the worst and the best.\"",
      "But the club's director of football has shown his frustration over the lack of progress in talks, accusing Sancho of lacking \"motivation\" to join the club.",
      "He told SportMediaSet: \"Sancho is a strong player, who was linked with all the Italian clubs.",
      "\"At the moment, it is only a suggestion, because it doesn't seem as if there are the right conditions and above all, the motivation to carry on these negotiations.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has claimed Ruben Amorim \"has no excuses\" this season and admitted the team's poor start to the season is \"a worry\".",
      "United have started the season with a 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal before drawing 1-1 away at Fulham as their wait for a first win goes on.",
      "The club have spent almost £200million on new signings this summer, with three high profile forwards arriving in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but the team still look far away from firing on all cylinders under Amorim.",
      "There was concern against Fulham after United failed to dominate the game and hurt Fulham, having also missed a penalty in the first half.",
      "Rooney is worried for his former club and believes Amorim is under pressure to pick up results \"quickly\" after a poor start, believing he won't get the same leniency he had last season.",
      "\"There’s no excuses now for the manager this season,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show. \"He’s got to start getting results and getting them quickly.",
      "\"Once you start getting into October or November, if results don’t change drastically that’s when the pressure comes. They needed to hit the ground running this season and one point from six is a bit of a worry.\"",
      "When asked if Amorim could be backed as a long-term manager for United, Rooney replied: \"It’s difficult to sit here and say ‘Yeah 100 per cent’. I don’t think anyone could do that.",
      "“I don’t think Ruben would probably say that himself with what we’ve seen since he’s been at the club. I think recruitment has been good in the summer – although I’d still like to see two or three more players. But it’s difficult to say this is going to be our manager for the next five years based on what we’ve seen.”",
      "Rooney said one of the biggest concerns was that old habits from last season were starting to appear in this campaign, adding: \"[Amorim] had the pre-season and brought players in, you’d like to have seen a bit more and see the players understand their roles a bit better. There’s a lot to be worked on.\"",
      "The ex-England striker played 559 times for United and scored 253 goals, winning five Premier League titles, four domestic trophies and two European cups.",
      "United have some big games coming up to show they can push on under Amorim, starting with a trip to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup - where elimination is unthinkable.",
      "They then welcome Burnley to Old Trafford for a must-win clash next week before facing Manchester City and Chelsea after the international break.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are never far from full-blown crisis - and this season it has taken just two matches. After a summer that has seen them spend in excess of £200m, the Red Devils languish in 16th in the Premier League.",
      "They've got one point and scored just one goal and even that strike came off of Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz. It's certainly not been the start that anyone at United will have wanted.",
      "Of course, it's still early days. Only two games of the season have been played so there's plenty of time left for Ruben Amorim to turn the ship around.",
      "But United's current form follows a worrying trend under the Portuguese coach, having won just seven Premier League games since his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "It's been a poor start to the season for United, there's no getting around it. But there would be no reason to sack Amorim quite yet.",
      "His new signings are still getting bedded in and the transfer window remains open. And let's be fair to the Red Devils, they've not had the easiest starts to the season.",
      "They gave title contenders Arsenal a real run for their money - and could have claimed at least a point - while Fulham look an outside bet for a European spot so a draw away at Craven Cottage is not the end of the world. You also have to remember simply how bad United were last season.",
      "Amorim will not fix all of those issues overnight. He needs time. And that's exactly what he should be given by United chiefs. Let him get to at least November and then you can re-evaluate. If United are still struggling to string wins together then by all means pull the trigger but to even think of sacking him any time soon would be nonsensical.",
      "The fact that we’re talking about the future of a manager after two games of a new season tells you all you need to know about the extent to which Manchester United’s struggles get everyone talking. This isn’t anything like Graham Potter’s situation, with the West Ham boss under pressure after two games, two defeats and eight goals conceded - and even that has been deemed too early by some.",
      "United have lost narrowly to a title contender and drawn an away game which they might have won in other circumstances. The word crisis is only being thrown around because the bar for that term is lower for the 13-time Premier League winners than for any other club in this country.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked by United because things were patently getting worse, and there was a case for getting rid in May 2024. Last season’s Europa League run showed Amorim has found a path to improvement, and to throw that all away should take a lot more justification than what we have seen so far this term.",
      "United should certainly give Amorim more time, but the signs look ominous. In their next handful of fixtures they face a trip to Manchester City and a home clash against Chelsea and you do wonder how things are going to get better.",
      "The next games against Grimsby and Burnley have to be two easy wins. Anything less and there will be some serious feelings of unease inside the fanbase - and the board. Every manager needs time to implement his strategy and new signings need to gel. But you do look at his 3-4-3 system and wonder if it's the best fit for the players he's got. We're yet to see Mbeumo and Cunha being the dangerous attackers they were tipped to be at Old Trafford, while the midfield situation looks like a real issue.",
      "The facts don't lie. Amorim has won only seven times from 29 Premier League games. He's drawn seven and lost 15. It's a results business and if things are still looking bleak by October or November, United might have to just accept this isn't going to work out.",
      "With a full pre-season behind him, Ruben Amorim would have hoped for a faster start but there is no need to panic. Under Erik ten Hag, United actually lost their first two Premier League games of the 2022-23 season and went on to finish third, albeit a fair distance behind winners Manchester City and runners-up Arsenal.",
      "There have been promising spells during the defeat at home to the Gunners and the draw at Fulham and a tally of 32 attempts on goal suggests this is a team that will create more chances than it did last season.",
      "Converting more of those chances is clearly the main issue for Amorim to sort and not starting with Benjamin Sesko has been a bit of a head-scratcher, even if there are doubts about his match fitness.",
      "But a front three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will score plenty of goals when they get to know each other well. Sure, the opening couple of matches has shown there is still a host of problems that Amorim needs to solve but those problems were so deep-rooted that he will need a lot more time to re-establish United as a serious Premier League force.",
      "You'd have thought that the positive thing about appointing a manager who is wedded to one system and one system only would be that over time that system would become fine-tuned, and the players would almost know exactly where their team-mates are without a second thought.",
      "That might end up being the case for Ruben Amorim, but given the changes in United's attack this summer things have almost gone back to square one as new players learn the way, the only way, the manager wants them to play.",
      "Of those new players Matheus Cunha looks lively but he isn't prolific, Benjamin Sesko will take a while to get up to speed and I have my doubts that Bryan Mbeumo was the right addition to play in this formation as a right sided No.10.",
      "All of which means United are back at a point where results are in danger of getting away from them, just as they did for most of last season.",
      "Amorim's job shouldn't be under immediate pressure now, but things can quickly get out of control. Burnley at home on Saturday is huge for him, with Manchester City and Chelsea to come after the international break.",
      "Manchester United have to hold their nerve. They cannot press the panic button because this season has got the potential to be a game-changer for the club.",
      "The front line looks so exciting with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. But in spending £206m on forwards, they have neglected other key areas: namely the keeper and a holding midfielder.",
      "But if they can do a deal for a keeper and get a better balance in midfield, I am still convinced they can have a decent season under Ruben Amorim.",
      "They better had - I’ve tipped them for top four! That is all based on that forward line because that front three is so exciting and is packed with goals.",
      "United have to improve elsewhere but they were never going to solve all their problems in one transfer window. And they still can’t and won’t.",
      "But we have seen enough, change and panic at Old Trafford to remind everyone they cannot do it again. They have to try and find a couple of solutions this week but either way this will be a better season for United despite the early bumps in the road.",
      "One point from two games isn't the rip-roaring start that Manchester United or their fans would have been seeking this season but it shouldn't be all doom and gloom. They were genuinely impressive - and unfortunate - in defeat against Arsenal and looked so much better going forward in patches against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "There's no getting away from the fact that Ruben Amorim's record in the Premier League has been poor since his arrival last November, but United have just committed more than £200million on a new-look attack. It would be insanity to hit the panic button anytime soon, particularly as other problem areas - namely the goalkeeper situation and midfield - are not issues of Amorim's making.",
      "The cold hard truth is that there is no magic fix for United after recording their worst-ever Premier League finish last season. There could be more pain before they turn a corner and Amorim's refusal to deviate from his favoured formation has split opinions.",
      "But he deserves a fair crack at turning things around that will take far long than just two transfer windows. I think there have been enough glimpses of promise in United's opening games to suggest that better times are coming.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has given a three-word reason for Benjamin Sesko’s early Manchester United struggles amid scathing criticism from Gary Neville. The £74million signing from RB Leipzig has come off the bench in United’s two Premier League games so far but made little impact, with Neville saying “he's nowhere near in terms of fitness.”",
      "Sesko is likely to make his first start for the club in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie at League Two Grimsby Town, where he will be hoping to top up his match sharpness and open his account for the club.",
      "Head coach Amorim has naturally jumped to Sesko’s defence. Speaking after the 1-1 draw at Fulham, where the 22-year-old replaced Casemiro early in the second half as part of a tactical switch, Amorim said: “He needs time.”",
      "The head coach added: “It's not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast. He is learning the game is faster than the Bundesliga but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "“Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him. Last week, I was saying, 'Look, let's just get him straight in.’ He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football. What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "“The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.”",
      "Asked why he kept Sesko on the bench for the second straight game, Amorim explained: “We tried to imagine what is going to happen during the game.",
      "“Our team needs to be consistent in the way that we control the game and we need to have options to play a different game on the bench. Sesko has had two weeks for us, he is trying to understand everything. We need to wait a little bit to help the player. We just want to win the game and try to help all of our players.”",

      "As the summer transfer window races towards its September 1 deadline, the next few days could be crucial for Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Manchester United. Both wingers are at the centre of a complex web of negotiations, valuations and rival club strategies, with Chelsea playing a key role in how the saga plays out.",
      "The plot thickened when United turned down a bold proposal from Chelsea: a swap deal involving Garnacho and 19-year-old winger Tyrique George. For Garnacho, who has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim, the move would have offered a new beginning at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Once touted as the next star of United's attack, Garnacho has become disenchanted with life under Amorim, who has shown little inclination to reselect the 21-year-old since their relationship soured. United, however, are not prepared to let him go on the cheap.",
      "They initially priced him at around £70m, while Chelsea have been pushing for a significantly lower fee of nearer to £30m, citing his strained relationship with Amorim as justification for a discount.",
      "United, though, have made their stance clear: if Chelsea were happy to shell out £55m for Jamie Gittens earlier this summer, then Garnacho - who has more Premier League experience - should command at least a similar price.",
      "This disagreement has brought talks to a standstill, with Chelsea reluctant to part with cash until they've finalised several key departures. While Garnacho has other suitors, he's got his sights set on Chelsea.",
      "For the Blues, Garnacho is just one piece of a larger puzzle. Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, and Tyrique George are all expected to leave before the transfer window slams shut, but their exits are still in the works.",
      "Whether Chelsea can generate funds and free up squad space could ultimately determine if either Garnacho or RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons - who has already agreed personal terms - end up in West London.",
      "Nkunku's situation is perhaps the most complex. Injuries have hampered him since his move to Chelsea, but his technical prowess continues to draw attention. Bayern Munich are interested, though they favour a loan deal, while Chelsea are adamant about a permanent sale.",
      "Aston Villa have also thrown their hat into the ring, with boss Unai Emery eager to inject some attacking diversity into his squad. A return to RB Leipzig is also a possibility, with Chelsea reportedly offering the Bundesliga side the chance to re-sign their former star as part of their bid to secure Simons.",
      "Jackson's future at Chelsea is also hanging in the balance. Despite a reasonably impressive goal record in England, the Senegalese forward has found himself pushed down the attacking pecking order following the arrival of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "Both Aston Villa and Newcastle are interested in Jackson, who is keen on a reunion with Emery, his former boss at Villarreal. However, Chelsea's hefty £70m price tag is proving to be a stumbling block, with potential buyers hoping for a reduction as the transfer deadline looms.",
      "Meanwhile, young talent George could be heading for an early exit from Stamford Bridge. With Pedro, Gittens, Estevao - and possibly Garnacho and Simons - joining the ranks, his chances of breaking into the first team are slimming.",
      "Initially, Chelsea intended to send George out on loan, but now a permanent move seems more likely. Roma have emerged as the favourites, eyeing him as their top winger target after missing out on Sancho.",
      "Sancho's transfer window has been fraught with disappointments and setbacks. United had reportedly struck a deal with Roma earlier this summer, but the England international turned down the Italian side's offer.",
      "This decision appears to have backfired. With Roma now focusing on George, Sancho is left scrambling for other options, while United are keen to offload the player, who spent the previous season on loan at Chelsea but failed to make a significant impact.",
      "Roma haven't completely dismissed the idea of reigniting their interest in Sancho, but their focus on George suggests that United's chances of offloading him are dwindling. Unless a late suitor comes into the picture, Sancho could find himself stuck in a rut at Old Trafford once again.",
      "Chelsea's ambitions stretch far beyond Garnacho and Simons, but the success of their plans depends on shifting players out. If deals for Nkunku, Jackson and George come to fruition, the Blues will have the funds and squad flexibility to make a strong push.",
      "If not, Garnacho might have to stay put - at least until January. It could even force Chelsea into a situation where they have to choose between Simons or Garnacho.",
      "For United, the situation is equally precarious. Garnacho remains a valuable asset that could generate a substantial fee that could be reinvested before the deadline. But their refusal to accept Chelsea's initial offer has slowed progress, leaving them at risk of being left with two disgruntled wingers and no financial uplift.",
      "As the clock ticks down, the futures of Garnacho, Sancho and several Chelsea attackers remain interconnected. The resolution of Chelsea's outgoing business may ultimately determine whether United can cash in - and whether two of their most unsettled players finally find fresh starts elsewhere.",
      "What transpires in the coming days could reshape squads at both Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, and send ripples across the European market.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Headphones on and clutching two iPhones and a washbag, Kobbie Mainoo exited the Manchester United coach via the rear exit on the Stevenage Road.",
      "Plenty of fans hollered, \"Kobbie\" but Mainoo vanished from sight as quickly as he placed the ball past Stefan Ortega in the 2024 FA Cup final. He lingered longer on the Craven Cottage pitch at full-time, anticipating a warm down.",
      "The only ball work Mainoo ended up doing at Fulham was in the warm up, a two-touch exercise that United substitutes favour. That was the happiest Mainoo looked all afternoon.",
      "Without the ball, the 20-year-old appeared glum, almost disillusioned. His smile has been replaced with a forlorn frown. Including pre-season, Mainoo has started in two of United's seven matches.",
      "A first competitive start of the campaign is inevitable at Grimsby Town on Wednesday before a return to the bench against Burnley on Saturday. Then a soul-searching fortnight. Jordan Henderson is proof Thomas Tuchel is not averse to shock England call-ups but a recall for Mainoo is unforeseeable.",
      "The next week is a test of nerve for Mainoo and his agent, David Lockwood. Some agencies have bristled at the number of United academy clients (Tyler Fredricson, Amir Ibragimov, Malachi Sharpe) Lockwood has acquired in recent years, apparently on the strength of Mainoo's development.",
      "Mainoo is no longer as untouchable as he was last summer. There is an acceptance at hierarchical level at United that the one-club man is over in this era of profitability and sustainability rules. Discussions over a new contract are at an impasse. \"No news,\" as Amorim said on Friday.",
      "United have five players ahead of Mainoo in the queue to shift. Daft things can happen in the final week of a window and patience can run out. It is not the time to fret over Mainoo.",
      "Ruben Amorim spoke effusively about him less than four weeks ago. \"With those feet, playing the ball, if he finds the right pace, playing like 'every time I give the ball, I find a new solution. Every time the guy is running back, I can follow the guy because he can'. He's going to be faster.\"",
      "Amorim revealed he is \"on top\" of Mainoo about his rhythm and pace. It was not so much what we saw of Mainoo on tour that was significant but what Amorim said. He spoke about Mainoo with all the confidence of a scientist who had found a cure.",
      "There are some parallels with Arne Slot upgrading Ryan Gravenberch from a peripheral to a pivotal player at Liverpool last season. Gravenberch joined Liverpool on transfer deadline day in September 2023 and it always felt like a mismatch. Jurgen Klopp transformed Liverpool into a force with physical athletes patrolling the midfield and the slight Gravenberch jarred with that profile.",
      "Erik ten Hag wanted Gravenberch at United (of course). Gravenberch's card was probably marked by the mixed results of his fellow Ajax alumni down the East Lancs Road while Ten Hag and Klopp are polar opposites in style and personality.",
      "Under his compatriot Slot, Gravenberch became Liverpool's linchpin and started all but one of their 37 Premier League matches as they regained the title. Gravenberch was named in the PFA Team of the Year last week.",
      "It was in Liverpool's dismantling of United in the third matchweek of last season at Old Trafford that Slot pinpointed where Gravenberch had adapted. \"What impressed me most when I started working with him [was] how much he can run and then still how good he is when he arrives in the duel.",
      "\"Today, you saw with him, Dominik [Szoboszlai] and Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] how much they were able to keep on running. Sometimes you’re late, but then they just kept on running and arriving in the duel. So, that is the one thing that impressed me most about him: how good he also is without the ball.\"",
      "Mainoo could be mistaken for one of the tyros developed by Barcelona. His stature, poise on the ball, slick passing and positional awareness are identical to the Catalan cubs. Mainoo would tear it up in La Liga.",
      "The intensity of the Premier League is unforgiving. Mainoo is no slouch but he has been guilty of lax reactions off the ball. Casemiro was the fall guy for Liverpool's stroll at Old Trafford a year ago but Mainoo was jogging while Gravenberch was sprinting for Luis Diaz's opening goal. Then he was ball-watching for the Colombian's second.",
      "Amorim has noticed that \"even Casemiro\" is operating at a higher pace off the ball. He prefers a midfield partnership of an attacking and defensive persuasion and only briefly settled on a gung-ho set-up in the second half at Fulham with the game goalless.",
      "Nuance is lacking in punditry and Mainoo was billed as United's \"fourth choice\" midfielder on Sunday. That ignored Mount's in-game stint at 0-0 and Manuel Ugarte emerged at 1-0 as Amorim sought to protect the lead.",
      "That Mainoo is in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes is hardly a shock. \"Bruno and Kobbie are in the same position,\" Amorim confirmed at Chicago Fire's training complex back on August 1. His quotes 23 days later were more newsworthy as Mainoo had spent almost an entire game sitting behind his manager in the dugout.",
      "The change of coach at United has hitherto been to Mainoo's detriment. Two central midfielders are still accommodated but the dynamics are markedly different in a back three and Mainoo has lined up only 15 times under Amorim. Missing four months of last season denied him that rhythm. Now he has to get up to speed.",
      "Then that smile will return.",

      "Manchester United have under a week to conclude their summer transfer business.",
      "The window closes at 7pm on Monday (September 1), which is earlier than in previous years. United still have work to do in the market and are set to be busy, particularly because outgoings still need to be arranged.",
      "Ruben Amorim has strengthened his squad with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon, but there could be more additions before the deadline.",
      "So we've taken a closer look at the deals United could still complete.",
      "Lammens was omitted from the Royal Antwerp squad last weekend. United are pushing ahead in negotiations to sign the keeper for a reported €20million (£17m) and he is expected to be Amorim's latest recruit.",
      "Lammens, 23, is a young goalkeeper who could challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. He stands at 6ft 3in, represents Belgium Under-21s and is seen as a goalkeeper with a bright future.",
      "United enquired about Baleba earlier in the window. Brighton value the midfielder at around £100m and have planned for him to stay at the Amex Stadium in 2025/2026, so a late move is highly unlikely.",
      "Having said that, football has a tendency to surprise and United haven't made a great start in the Premier League, so could they be tempted to test Brighton's stance with a late bid?",
      "It's possible, of course, but Brighton have expressed confidence that Baleba will stay, and it's probably wishful thinking that United could make a dramatic swoop for the midfielder.",
      "Onana's future is uncertain after he was named on the bench against Fulham last weekend. Amorim persisted with Altay Bayindir, despite his mistake against Arsenal..",
      "United take on Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday. If Onana is not recalled to the starting team, he could make a dramatic move away before the deadline.",
      "For now, sources are adamant that Onana is staying, but a lot can change in a week and the pieces are being moved around the board in the goalkeeper department at Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea are the frontrunners to sign Alejandro Garnacho, but United are determined not to allow the youngster to leave for a fee below his market value in the final weeks of the transfer window. Garnacho has been training on his own at Carrington since reporting for pre-season in July.",
      "Roma contacted United to discuss Sancho on loan, with an obligation to buy for £20million next summer, but the Italian club could not agree on personal terms with the outcast winger.",
      "Sancho's move to Chelsea broke down due to his wage demands, so the London club decided to pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break their obligation to sign the winger. The 25-year-old needs to be realistic about his expectations for his next destination.",
      "Antony is believed to be holding out for a transfer to Real Betis. The Brazilian was hugely successful during his loan with Betis last season, but the Spanish club are struggling to finance a permanent deal.",
      "The player's agent has left the door open to Saudi Arabia. \"What I can say is that the player is on the market, and there are several clubs that want to know his current status,\" he said. \"We listen to the projects and analyse them. But he is open to moving to Saudi Arabia. Anything is possible.\"",
      "United would have to sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss, and it would not be a shock to see him join Betis as part of a fresh loan deal.",
      "Hojlund was dropped from the squad to face Arsenal in the Premier League and did not travel to Craven Cottage to face Fulham because he is set to leave before the transfer deadline.",
      "Speaking after Arsenal, Amorim said: \"It is our player - we have to make choices. We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside. He has to fight for his place. We will see what's going to happen. Rasmus has the same characteristics as Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",
      "Italian champions, Napoli, are understood to be pushing to wrap up a deal for Hojlund.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute against Arsenal and Fulham, raising concerns about where he fits into the team again. \"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo on Sunday.",
      "Mainoo's contract situation has stalled and the MEN reported in March that there was a genuine chance United and the youngster could go their separate ways in the summer window.",
      "There has been no breakthrough in contract talks and could he better off leaving for regular starts elsewhere?",
      "Malacia celebrated his 26th birthday this week and interest has been thin on the ground following his loan with PSV, although Roma have been linked with a move for the defender.",

      "Manchester United's prospective signing of Senne Lammens would add further intrigue to a muddled goalkeeper situation at Old Trafford, but it would signal the arrival of a potential long-term number one.",
      "Lammens is understood to be an active target for United and while club sources insist the deal is not as close to being done as is being widely reported, the 23-year-old could still end up at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "It all adds to the intrigue around Lammens, with the current Antwerp stopper likely to put further pressure on Onana if he does sign for United.",
      "Onana was signed on the back of starring as Inter reached the 2023 Champions League final, with the Reds trumpeting his ability to play out. But there remain question marks over Onana more than two years since his arrival and he has produced some erratic moments between the posts.",
      "It's a similar story for Bayindir, who has largely failed to impress when given the opportunity.",
      "It opens a potential door for Lammens and he would provide an assuredness that Onana and Bayindir have so far failed to offer.",
      "The 'keeper is a decent distributor and his shot-stopping would be a level above the former Inter man. Lammens is a commanding presence in goal and an excellent shot stopper - according to Opta Analyst, he prevented 17.4 goals from being scored in the Belgian Pro League in 2024-25.",
      "Those attributes coupled with his calming influence on a backline would be welcome at Old Trafford and provide the sort of stability United have been seeking between the posts, as Lammens himself said in a 2024 interview with Het Nieuwsblad.",
      "\"As a goalkeeper you have to stay calm to instil confidence in your defenders and the rest of the team.",
      "\"You're not supposed to be stressed out between the posts. As a youth player, that happened to me sometimes, but in recent years, it hasn't bothered me at all.",
      "\"They always say that I stay level emotionally. That I'm stable and never go up or down too quickly. I'm happy about that, by the way. I think that's a good quality for a goalkeeper.\"",
      "It's a quality United haven't seen enough of from their current custodians. Lammens has it in spades.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022.",
      "When a team changes manager and the dust settles following the initial hysteria, often one of the first questions to be asked is which players will benefit most from the new man's arrival.",
      "If a manager can start to get a tune out of an expensive recruit who has so far failed to prove their worth, they've instant credit in the bank from fans and those within the club's hierarchy.",
      "But there's a lot more to it than 'they played well under them before and so this time should be no different'. Take Erik ten Hag's arrival at United as an example.",
      "The Dutchman was keen to surround himself with home comforts, regularly targeting players either from, or who had spent time in, the Eredivisie. Yet, having inherited a player he had coached previously at Ajax in Donny van de Beek, he failed to get the best out of the midfielder, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had before him, and Van de Beek was shipped off to Girona after playing just eight league games in two years under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ruben Amorim was appointed United manager in November 2024, it would be wrong to suggest there was instant hope that he could get the best out of Manuel Ugarte. The pair worked together at Sporting Lisbon, and with Ugarte not even three months into his United career, the jury was well and truly still out on the Uruguayan.",
      "Fast forward nine months and there is a real worry Amorim will not get to see the best of the 24-year-old midfielder at United.",
      "Ugarte was brought to United for a fee rising to £50.75million on transfer deadline day last summer. The Uruguay international was signed to be the successor to Casemiro in United's midfield, yet the man he was brought in to replace has started ahead of him in both Premier League games so far this season.",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain star showed glimpses of promise during pre-season, most notably against West Ham where he was one of the best players on the pitch in a 2-1 win in New Jersey. He again looked bright off the bench against Bournemouth, but regressed dramatically against Everton in the final game of the US tour and has not been seen in a starting XI since.",
      "Opting to start the 33-year-old Casemiro in Premier League games, as brilliant as he once was, is an admission of defeat.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 by the time the 2025/26 season comes to an end, and having been on a downward slope for more than 18 months, having him as one of your starting central midfielders when the bell rings at 7pm on September 1 simply isn't an option.",
      "It's up to Amorim to make it work with Ugarte, but if he thinks Casemiro is a safer bet in midfield than the man he worked with at Sporting Lisbon then he clearly doesn't think it will work.",
      "There's still time for deals to be done before the transfer window closes. Over to you, United.",

      "With just seven days of the transfer window remaining, United know they will have to act quickly to get any deals tied up - and it looks as if their next summer signing is on the way.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is set to make the move to Old Trafford, having missed the Belgian side’s match against Mechelen on Sunday. Lammens is expected to seal a £17m transfer to United.",
      "That move is expected to place further doubt on the futures of Andre Onana and Altiy Bayindir. Ruben Amorim again chose Banindir as his starting goalkeeper for the 1-1 draw at Fulham at the weekend.",
      "United were also linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper looks to be heading to Manchester City.",

      "According to CaughtOffside, Galatasaray are keeping an eye on Manchester United's Andre Onana as they look to sign a new goalkeeper before the end of the transfer window.",

      "David De Gea could be set for a surprise Manchester United reunion with his former Reds teammate Victor Lindelof in talks to sign for Fiorentina.",
      "Although Fiorentina didn't have a terrible defensive record last season, they want to strengthen their back-line before the end of the transfer window. Indeed, according to Fabrizio Romano, Stefano Pioli's side are in talks over a surprise deal to sign Lindelof, who is a free agent after leaving United back in June.",
      "Negotiations have started with his camp while Lindelof also has two offers from the Premier League. The final decision is up to the Sweden international, though Fiorentina are pushing to get a deal done.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is open to leaving Manchester United. The 20-year-old was an unused substitute during Sunday's draw against Fulham and Ruben Amorim appears to be prefer other midfielders.",

      "Manchester United officially have one week remaining to finalise any transfers they intend to before the deadline. That goes for incomings as well as outgoings.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been successful in bolstering the area of the squad he felt required it most - the attack. Following his appointment midway through last season, the United manager only witnessed 30 Premier League goals scored by his group in the 25 matches he oversaw.",
      "Therefore, they have put down £207.5m on the attacking trio of Benjamin Sesko (£74m), Bryan Mbeumo (£71m) and Matheus Cunha (£62.5m).",
      "The immediate focus may have shifted towards moving on those who will not have a place in the project - Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - but if completed with enough time remaining then further incomings are not out of the realms of possibility.",

      "Ahead of Manchester United's Premier League opener against Arsenal, there was a debate about who would partner Bruno Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Following the additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to the attacking ranks, it was inevitable Fernandes would be deployed as one of the two No.8s. He frequently dropped deep last season and was often more effective from the engine room.",
      "Despite regressing in each of the last two Premier League campaigns, Casemiro was given the nod for the season curtain-raiser. He was tasked with keeping order in midfield.",
      "Into the final year of his United contract and turning 34 next February, many believed the club should have pushed to sell the Brazilian this summer. Instead, he has started each of the Reds' opening two games, having kept his place for Sunday's stalemate at Fulham.",
      "As a result of partnering Fernandes once again, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo were on the bench for the second game running. And just like against Arsenal, Ugarte was the one called upon by Ruben Amorim during the second half while Mainoo was not.",
      "It means the 20-year-old is still waiting to make his first Premier League appearance of the season. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who predicted Mainoo would remain glued to the bench for United's opening two games.",
      "Although he has just under two years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, the England international's future at the club is in doubt. Amorim indicated last week that no progress has been made on tying him down to a new deal.",
      "Amorim has struggled to settle on Mainoo's best position since arriving at United, tasking him with playing as a No.8, a No.10 and even as a false nine. It is no secret he is a forward-thinking player, meaning, in Amorim's defence, it is hard to justify playing him alongside Fernandes in the centre of midfield amid the duo's attacking intentions.",
      "It is why Amorim had a point when he said after the draw at Craven Cottage that Mainoo and Fernandes are competing for the same role.",
      "\"He's fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he's going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he's fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "With less than a week of the window left, United still want to sign a midfielder. They want a player of an athletic profile that can seemingly compliment Fernandes' characteristics in the engine room.",
      "The prospect of bringing in a suitable partner risks pushing Mainoo even further down the pecking order. And if that situation transpires, United, who still need to generate cash via sales this summer, could find themselves in a position where they are prepared to cash-in on a player who not all that long ago was considered as their crown jewel.",
      "As a result of not currently being at the forefront of Amorim's plans, United, if chief executive Omar Berrada's comments about player sales are anything to go by, might be willing to cash-in on the academy graduate.",
      "\"When it comes to sales, we will do it purely on the basis of whether it helps improve the team or not, not for financial reasons,\" Berrada said back in March.",
      "Given Mainoo has played no part in United's opening two games, the club may be prepared to sanction an exit if an avenue of opportunity opens up in the coming days.",
      "If Amorim has no plans to play Mainoo in a prominent role, they should consider letting him go if the price is right. A player of his talent deserves to be playing.",

      "David de Gea could be set for a surprise Manchester United reunion with his former Old Trafford teammate Victor Lindelof in talks to sign for Fiorentina.",
      "De Gea, 34, left United in June 2023 after 12 years with the club. During that time, De Gea made 545 appearances, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League among other honours.",
      "De Gea departed United following the expiration of his contract, leaving as a free agent. There had been talk that he could return straight to action and move to Saudi Arabia, but the ex-Atletico Madrid stopper instead spent a considerable amount of time out of the game. Indeed, De Gea did not sign for another club for more than 12 months - until August 2024 - when he made the move to Serie A side Fiorentina.",
      "The Spaniard impressed during his first season in Florence, keeping 11 clean sheets and conceding just 50 goals in 42 matches. De Gea was rewarded for his fine performances with a new three-year contract at La Viola.",
      "Although Fiorentina didn't have a particularly poor defensive record last season, they want to strengthen their back-line before the end of the transfer window. Indeed, according to Fabrizio Romano, Stefano Pioli's side are in talks over a surprise deal to sign Lindelof, who is a free agent after leaving United back in June.",
      "Negotiations have started with his camp, while Lindelof also has two offers from the Premier League. The final decision is up to the Sweden international, though Fiorentina are pushing to get a deal done.",
      "Should Lindelof make the move to Florence, he would complete a reunion with ex-United teammate De Gea. The duo played together at Old Trafford for six years between 2017 and 2023. Throughout that period, Lindelof and De Gea helped the Reds to some success, winning the Carabao Cup during their final season in Manchester.",
      "Lindelof departed United at the end of last campaign, following eight years of service. He played 284 times for the club, picking up two major trophies and becoming an established member of the first-team squad.",
      "But, after struggled for regular game time following the appointment of Ruben Amorim last November, Lindelof exited United when his contract expired in June. Speaking after his final game for the Reds in May, he said: \"Yeah, I am proud of myself. It's been a lot of ups and downs. But I mean, for me to be able to represent this club for eight years, it's been an honour and a privilege, and a dream come true.\"",

      "Onana was omitted from Manchester United's squad for the opening Premier League game against Arsenal after returning from injury with just three training sessions under his belt.",
      "That felt like enough training sessions for Onana to be involved, but Amorim decided to leave him out. Onana returned to the squad to face Fulham at Craven Cottage, but was named on the bench.",
      "Altay Bayindir was at fault against Arsenal but kept his place in between the sticks. Fulham targeted United from corners and fans needed to swallow Gaviscon tablets when deliveries were sent into the box.",
      "Bayindir is like a deer in the headlights at set-pieces. The Turkey international does have a presence in the box and even Onana commands his penalty area with more aggression.",
      "Onana is essentially the lesser of two evils. He has committed several goalkeeper errors during his time at United, but he is a better goalkeeper than Bayindir and must start against Grimsby on Wednesday night.",
      "However, Amorim sent a message in London last weekend and it remains to be seen whether Onana will be recalled, as starting Bayindir at Fulham suggests he is now preferred.",
      "Onana picked up a hamstring injury almost immediately after reporting for pre-season and Bayindir started every summer friendly except one, but that doesn't explain Amorim's decision.",
      "Last season is more likely to be the explanation. Onana made high-profile mistakes against Nottingham Forest, Viktoria Plzen and Lyon, and he clashed with Nemanja Matic on the eve of facing the French side in the Europa League quarter-final first leg.",
      "The season confirmed that Onana needs to be replaced for long-term success, but Bayindir is not the answer.",
      "Sources say Onana “will 100% stay” at Old Trafford, despite the possibility of Lammens coming in, although external sources have suggested Onana’s position is not as certain ahead of the transfer deadline on Monday.",
      "We will learn more about where Onana stands with Amorim at Blundell Park. If the Cameroon international is not recalled, it seems his time at Old Trafford will be over.",
      "United are entering the Carabao Cup second round due to their failure to qualify for Europe last season. That is why a fixture at Grimsby awaits and it would be sobering for Onana if he did not start.",
      "Grimsby are in League Two and United are heavy favourites to progress to the next round. The chances of Onana leaving before the deadline will increase tenfold if he does not start.",

      "There were more incredulous contours on Ruben Amorim's face that spidered like a crack on a windscreen at his post-match press conference.",
      "We are not in his facetious form at his debriefs. Optimism is supposed to be rife in August. Only Amorim has been mentioned in the same breath as Paul Hart and Neil Warnock.",
      "Problems are surfacing at Manchester United and they are of their own making. Amorim is continuing to play their third-best goalkeeper, the midfield is brazenly targeted, the supporters in the Putney End hollered, “attack, attack, attack” in the 83rd minute and two centre backs emerged four minutes later.",
      "That will be down to managing workloads. At 1-1, Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw could have soldiered on for another ten minutes before a recovery day in the jacuzzi at Carrington.",
      "Four of the five United substitutes who came on are defensive players. Such an approach, when the team has won seven of the manager’s 29 Premier League games in charge, was unedifying.",
      "Those wins are scattered like a trail that has run out of bread crumbs: two in December, two in January, one in February, one in March and one in May. Three of the victories were against teams now in the Championship.",
      "Amorim dismissed the suggestion that United’s sudden change of plan midway through pre-season has affected their form. Since he removed Rasmus Hojlund from the starting XI and switched to a strikerless side against Everton in Atlanta, none of United's starters have scored from open play in four games.",
      "Including pre-season, United’s form with and without Hojlund reads:",
      "It was at Fulham last season that Amorim admitted he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, on the bench than Marcus Rashford. Vital has now replaced Hojlund. The Denmark international was not in west London on Sunday and is unlikely to get a kick for United again.",
      "The intention to sell Hojlund is understandable. He is not good enough to lead the line for United, he tallied three goals in his last 35 appearances for the club and they have replaced him.",
      "But Amorim has cut off his nose to spite his face with a striker who has had one cameo since he bullishly told journalists in Chicago that he was intent on staying. United were crying out for a striker, bought one for £73.62million, and have not started him.",
      "Watching Benjamin Sesko, you can see why. “I think he needs time,” Amorim admitted. “It’s not easy. Sometimes you are on the bench and go to the game and the game is really fast, he’s understanding that the game is even faster than the Bundesliga.",
      "“But he is fighting, he had some good connections with teammates, I felt that when he was on the pitch we were not in our best moment and that can change the way you see a player.”",
      "All the more reason to play a No.9. United could have maximised Hojlund, scorer of two goals on his last start against Bournemouth in Chicago, until Sesko was up to speed. Hojlund might have been more sellable and valuable, too.",
      "Instead, Matheus Cunha has had to double as a centre forward when he earned his move on his playmaking prowess. He ought to have converted his chance from Altay Bayindir’s punt, a scenario identical to Cunha's majestic goal at the same end for Wolves last season.",
      "Swapping the old gold for the red of United puts a player in a different mindset. Even one as classy as Cunha. He has been as confident and swashbuckling as he was for Wolves, only when he faultlessly controlled the ball he could not place it beyond Bernd Leno’s reach.",
      "United are in paradoxical form. Their attacking trident has created good chances and they are more fluid than rigid. Mason Mount had one of his most accomplished hours in a United shirt at Fulham. Yet they failed to get on the scoresheet and United’s periods of play with Sesko, an actual striker, have been unproductive.",
      "Mount is the last United player to score from open play, against Everton three weeks ago. Since United touched down back on these shores, their two goals, against Fiorentina in a friendly and at Fulham, have been own goals.",
      "“I think it’s a normal thing and when you reach this level,” Amorim said about the no-striker strategy. “Cunha can play as a striker and as a 10 at his former club.",
      "“I felt that during these last games with Mason Mount sometimes we are more robust in the way we play. So we are going to change according to the result and the opponent and try to win games.”",
      "Amorim’s stubbornness is the same at the other end. Retaining Bayindir was a contrarian call. He is demonstrably not United’s best goalkeeper and, though his afternoon at Fulham was devoid of a costly error, he was jittery again at corners.",
      "United need certainty in goal. Senne Lammens, the Belgian goalkeeper United are expected to sign, is not viewed as an outright No.1. So why persist playing the back-up goalie when the first-choice is fit enough to take the train to Euston?",
      "The prospect of United accommodating four goalkeepers this season is improbable. Tom Heaton is 39, has not played in two-and-a-half years and signed a new one-year contract in June. Bayindir has started in six of United’s seven games since the start of pre-season and Onana has not played since the post-season tour match in Kuala Lumpur yet is adamant he is staying.",
      "Mount dropped back into midfield nine days after Amorim mentioned him as an option to fill in there. He had to after Casemiro, on a yellow card, diced with death by sliding in late on Sander Berge. Amorim immediately summoned his first substitutes.",
      "Starting Casemiro on a weekly basis in the Premier League is an admission of defeat. This is his last season at United and they recruited a replacement last year. Manuel Ugarte, totally devoid of confidence, does not appear up to it and the interest in Carlos Baleba would suggest some at United have given up on the Uruguayan. Erik ten Hag was not sold on Ugarte and Amorim, who coached him at Sporting Lisbon, has benched him.",
      "At Craven Cottage last season, Amorim admitted he felt like he had aged ten years at United. Worry signs are forming again.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is modelling for a commercial partner and Kobbie Mainoo is recording snippets for the Chinese New Year. Luke Shaw arrives to speak with club media in another room.",
      "Three Manchester United correspondents have been invited to speak with Patrick Dorgu, who is slightly late for his engagement after spending time with young season ticket holders.",
      "United's press officer briefly speaks to Dorgu before ushering journalists into the new-look press conference room. Dorgu is about to speak for 16 minutes, touching on his desire to win the Premier League this season, his blossoming relationship with Matheus Cunha, finding his feet in Manchester after a ruthless introduction to English football and Rasmus Hojlund's future.",
      "\"I think I learned a lot,\" said Dorgu of last season. \"It was a difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season.\"",
      "United signed Dorgu from Lecce for £25million, with a potential £4.1m in add-ons, in the January transfer window, and United won just three Premier League matches after his arrival.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Dorgu was thrown into the deep end. However, he was a heavily data-driven signing and the numbers suggested he would be able to swim.",
      "Staff have noticed a difference in Dorgu in recent weeks. He is more confident, more willing to speak. He has become comfortable at Carrington, which should be reflected in his performances.",
      "And against Arsenal, he struck the post from distance, a shot he admits he would not have had the confidence to take last season.",
      "\"It's a new season and everyone did well in pre-season,\" he said. \"I'm just trying to play myself into the team more. Just give the fans what they deserve and I think everyone is trying to put United where we need to be.\"",
      "United believe Dorgu has the attributes to become a top player. \"I had interest from big teams in Italy as well, so it (United's interest) wasn’t a surprise,\" he said. \"If you're doing well, the big teams are going to look. I was surprised that they were really aggressive to get it done quickly, and I was really happy for that.\"",
      "Which big clubs in Italy were interested? \"I'm not going to say,\" he laughed.",
      "The 20-year-old was signed for Ruben Amorim's system and is first-choice at left wing-back.",
      "\"In Denmark, I was playing wing-back. Then when I moved to Lecce, I was playing left back, and then the last season before I moved to United, I was playing more as a winger,\" he said.",
      "\"It's just easier to attack as a wing back than as a full back - I feel comfortable in that role. But I could still do the job as I full back, but it's just less attacking.\"",
      "Regarding his current role, he added: \"I think just a lot of runs, like being more attacking. I could have been more attacking last season and I feel like in pre-season I've improved that a little bit. It's just to attack more [Amorim's message], get into the box, help the team create more chances.",
      "\"I like to tackle, I like to attack, I like to score goals, gain assists, so I think just to play wing back, you need to be all around, you need to be good at tackling, you need to be good at defensive work as well.\"",
      "Amorim's formation has been scrutinised, so what does Dorgu think? \"It depends what system you're playing against. You can always drop alongside the centre backs to make it a 4-3-3,\" he said.",
      "\"It's just about adapting to who you're playing against and just help each other, move for each other, and then it's not really about the system. It's more like how you're dealing with it.",
      "\"It's up to you how you want to play. If the midfielders feel like they're getting man-marked, then they can move down [towards defence], get the ball, and then play. You just need to move.",
      "\"Obviously, you're not just going to move around [anywhere]. I can't just run to the right side, but you can move in your position.\"",
      "Speaking about Amorim, Dorgu added: \"He's a really good guy, he's positive with everyone and always defending you. He always tries to help you play the game, so he knows how it is.",
      "\"We definitely understand more [what Amorim wants]. We understand what he wants us to do, and obviously, now that we're not in Europe, we have more training.",
      "\"He has more time for us to really understand his ideas. Obviously, we want to go back to playing many games. Now we have the time to do it and then we need to perform this season.\"",
      "Dorgu has grand ambitions: to win the Premier League and play at the 2026 World Cup for Denmark. When asked whether United can return to Europe, he responded: \"100 per cent, we are aiming to win the Premier League and we just need to take it game by game.\"",
      "Amorim has explained the internal target is European qualification. United are planning to win the Premier League by 2028, but Dorgu is impatient and insists it should be the aim this season.",
      "\"100 per cent. We are Manchester United, so that's always going to be our goal,\" he added.",
      "The reality is United are a world away from winning the title. The morale in the dressing room improved this summer, but the 1-1 draw against Fulham is a reminder that results must also improve.",
      "\"I think the facilities help, I think new signings have helped as well,\" Dorgu said. \"They bring a lot of good energy, quality into the group. We tried to be positive about our new season.",
      "\"Everyone has a point to prove this season. We need to get back to Europe, so I feel like if we are as a group and ready to perform on the pitch. We need to stick together, be happy, positive, and try to do what the coach asks.\"",
      "Dorgu is no longer the new face at Old Trafford with this summer seeing a trio of expensive attacking reinforcements join, including Matheus Cunha. When he arrived from Wolves he told Dorgu not to kick him, a reference to their encounter at Old Trafford last season.",
      "\"He had me once when I got a yellow card,\" recalled Dorgu. \"Besides that, he was quiet in the game. Matheus is a really public guy, like he talks a lot and he's really funny - he's trying to engage with everyone so it's easier to talk with him because he has a lot of energy.",
      "\"I feel like he's really, really good at driving with the ball, getting past players, and I feel like with my runs and what I can do will help him to do that, and get more space to play, and we just need to connect well, like me and him.",
      "\"Obviously, there other players as well. It's not only on the left side, we need to attack on both sides. It helps getting Cunha in because he's really good at what he's doing and he's going to help the team.\"",
      "Although Dorgu admitted he \"gets on\" with everyone in the dressing room, he nominated Hojlund as his closest friend. \"Probably Ras because he's Danish and I know him from when I was younger,\" he said. \"I played against him when I was at Nordsjælland and he was at Copenhagen.\"",
      "Hojlund has been left of the squad for succesive games and is expected to leave before the transfer deadline. \"Obviously, we don't know if he's leaving. He is training with us and he's part of the team,\" said Dorgu.",
      "\"You need to talk to the coach about why he was not in the squad. But if he ended up leaving, that's part of the game, everyone is not secure to be here. Obviously I would still see him with the national team.\"",
      "Dorgu looked in high spirits in the photographs of himself playing football with 13 young season ticket holders on the morning of the interview. The children were selected to take part in a skills workshop with Manchester United Foundation coaches and were treated to Dorgu's presence.",
      "United say the aim of such fan engagement activities is to provide memorable experiences for their most loyal supporters, to increase understanding between fans and players of each others’ perspectives, and, ultimately, to strengthen the bond between the fans and the team.",
      "Dorgu wants to further strentghen the bond with matchgoing fans by winning games again.",

      "Bayindir was bullied inside the six-yard box, meaning the ball sailed over his head from Declan Rice's corner, finding the head of Riccardo Calafiori right on the line.",
      "Despite that, he kept his place for Sunday's 1-1 draw with Fulham, but was once again vulnerable when it came to dealing with crosses, both from open play and at set-pieces.",
      "As a result, Ferdinand believes United's coaching staff have got to continue working with him closely on the training ground, saying they must be \"smashing balls under the crossbar\" to improve his ability when it comes to dealing with balls into the box.",
      "\"He needs to liven up,\" said the former United defender, speaking on his YouTube channel. \"I know that, definitely.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Kobbie Mainoo is in competition with Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes for a place in the starting XI.",
      "Mainoo was unused for the second week running in United's 1-1 draw at Fulham, as Amorim sent on four defensive players in the second half.",
      "The only outright attacking change by the United head coach was the introduction of new striker Benjamin Sesko as Mainoo and striker Joshua Zirkzee remained in the dugout.",
      "Mason Mount dropped back into central midfield following the substitution of Casemiro with the game goalless. Defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte replaced Mount in the 69th minute with United 1-0 up.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is likely to make his first appearance of the season in the League Cup second round tie at Grimsby Town on Wednesday but he has started in only 15 of Amorim's 44 matches in charge.",
      "Amorim favours an attacking midfielder and a defensive midfielder in his 3-4-2-1 system and Fernandes remains an automatic pick.",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he’s going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he’s fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Since Rasmus Hojlund came out of the team in pre-season, United have scored one goal from open play in four matches. Amorim started a strikerless side for the second Premier League game running as Sesko emerged in the second half but United's only goal was an own goal by Rodrigo Muniz.",
      "United won two of their five pre-season matches and both came with Hojlund starting up front. Amorim rejected the suggestion the players have had to adapt to a new approach without a centre forward.",
      "\"I think it’s a normal thing when you reach this level,\" he added. \"Cunha can play as a striker and as a 10. I felt that during these last games with Mason Mount sometimes we are more robust in the way we play.",
      "\"So we are going to change according to the result and the opponent and try to win games.\"",

      "Amorim was also asked about the incident, but the United boss refused to get drawn into speculation that he was put off. “He knows the importance that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team,\" he said.",

[De Bruyne] doesn't need any advice; I need advice from him!",

The midfielder is said to be 'open' to the move - and is understood to have requested a contract worth approximately £33million-a-year. Although that doesn't necessarily mean their captain, Fernandes, will be leaving - a potential departure would, of course, provide them with a significant financial boost, freeing up funds that could be reinvested into their squad or used to secure high-profile targets.",
      "On Baleba, the club's hierarchy have opted to wait (at least) another year before trying to get a deal over the line. Brighton & Hove Albion have valued the 21-year-old in excess of £100million and are adamant Baleba is not for sale.",

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",
      "",
      "Robbie Brady – £13m (Norwich, January 2017)\nChris Wood – £15m (Leeds, August 2017)\nBen Gibson – £15m (Middlesbrough, August 2018)\nZeki Amdouni – £16.1m (Basel, July 2023)\nLesley Ugochukwu – £25m (Chelsea, August 2025)",
      "It once used to be just giant centre-halves and centre-forwards up there with the odd Robbie Brady chucked in, but Lesley Ugochukwu really does represent a departure from the norm for Burnley and expensive signings. At that sort of price it is hoped he can help keep them up.",
      "",
      "Alvaro Morata – £58m (Real Madrid, July 2017)\nKepa Arrizabalaga – £71m (Athletic Bilbao, August 2018)\nKai Havertz – £75.8m (Leverkusen, September 2020)\nRomelu Lukaku – £97.5m (Inter Milan, August 2021)\nEnzo Fernandez – £106.8m (Benfica, February 2023)",
      "There is a genuine case to say Fernandez is legitimately the best of those Chelsea signings, which reflects well on no-one. But Todd Boehly has continued that proud tradition of general waste, with £100m Moises Caicedo finally approaching his best form as the other half of a potentially sensational midfield.",
      "",
      "Dwight Gayle – £4.5m (Peterborough, July 2013)\nJames McArthur – £7m (Wigan, September 2014)\nYohan Cabaye – £10m (PSG, July 2015)\nAndros Townsend – £13m (Newcastle, July 2016)\nChristian Benteke – £27m (Liverpool, August 2016)",
      "A ludicrous fact: not a single one of those signings was made by Roy Hodgson (nine transfer windows in charge). Crystal Palace presumably still regret giving Alan Pardew (four transfer windows in charge) quite so much pocket money.",
      "And if none is given to Oliver Glasner even after cashing in on Eberechi Eze then they really could lose their greatest manager.",
      "",
      "Yakubu Aiyegbini – £11.3m (Middlesbrough, August 2007)\nMarouane Fellaini – £15m (Standard Liege, September 2008)\nRomelu Lukaku – £28m (Chelsea, July 2014)\nJordan Pickford – £30m (Sunderland, June 2017)\nGylfi Sigurdsson – £45m (Swansea, August 2017)",
      "Not sure what to say about that. It would probably make the best five-a-side team of any club on this list. Would love to see Lukaku at Powerleague.",

      "Edwin van der Sar – £7m (Juventus, August 2001)\nSteve Marlet – £11.5m (Lyon, August 2001)\nKonstantinos Mitroglou – £12m (Olympiakos, January 2014)\nJean Michael Seri – £25m (Nice, July 2018)\nEmile Smith Rowe – £27m, rising to £34m (Arsenal, August 2024)",
      "Fulham do like to use their regular Premier League promotions, or in the case of Mitroglou imminent relegations, to open new transfer doors. Though last summer they waited for the cash to arrive for Joao Palhinha before splashing out on Smith Rowe. The jury is out on whether he was worth the outlay.",
      "",
      "Michael Bridges – £5.6m (Sunderland, July 1999)\nOlivier Dacourt – £7.2m (Lens, July 2000)\nRio Ferdinand – £18m (West Ham, November 2000)\nRodrigo – £27m (Valencia, August 2020)\nGeorginio Rutter – £35.5m (Hoffenheim, January 2023)",
      "It took 20 months for Leeds to break their transfer record thrice from July 1999. It took 20 years for Leeds to break their transfer record once from November 2000. They took a chance on Rutter in 2023 that did not save them from relegation but did at least make a small profit when he became Brighton’s record signing.",
      "",
      "Luis Suarez – £22.7m (Ajax, January 2011)\nAndy Carroll – £35m (Newcastle, January 2011)\nMo Salah – £36.9m (Roma, June 2017)\nVirgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton, January 2018)\nFlorian Wirtz – £100m, rising to £116m (Bayer Leverkusen, June 2025)",
      "The blockbuster arrival of Florian Wirtz blows the Van Dijk fee out of the water, but the good news for Liverpool is that this is a list containing more unambiguous success stories than most, and you always need an exception to prove the rule anyway. If you want further proof of Liverpool’s ability to get a record transfer just right, the player knocked out of this top five by Wirtz? Fernando Torres.",

      "As masters of the £50m transfer and really anything in that general ballpark, it seemed as though Pep Guardiola had rather unfairly cracked the art of the £100m move. Grealish overcame the usual season one struggles to contribute to a Treble in his second campaign before unlocking the lesser-seen difficult third Pep year. And fourth.",
      "",

      "Fair play to Manchester United for accepting that their last two club-record signings were either immediately or eventually so catastrophic it would be foolish to try again. They have the longest-standing current Premier League transfer record.",
      "",
      "Alan Shearer – £15m (Blackburn, July 1996)\nMichael Owen – £16m (Real Madrid, August 2005)\nMiguel Almiron – £20m (Atlanta United, January 2019)\nJoelinton – £40m (Hoffenheim, July 2019)\nAlexander Isak – £58m, rising to £63m (August 2022)",
      "We suspect a lot of those Isak add-ons will have been met, although it is unlikely any of them stipulated that toys had to be expelled so far from the pram first. Will FFP ever allow Newcastle to break that record again?",
      "",
      "Taiwo Awoniyi – £17.2m (Union Berlin, June 2022)\nEmmanuel Dennis – £20m (Watford, August 2022)\nMorgan Gibbs-White – £25m, rising to £42.5m (Wolves, August 2022)\nIbrahim Sangare – £30m (PSV, August 2023)\nElliot Anderson – £35m (Newcastle United, July 2024)",
      "Another one difficult to accurately decipher without access to what are undoubtedly hilarious financial accounts, as while Elliot Anderson’s £35m fee obviously outstrips Sangare’s, both have either been eclipsed by Gibbs-White’s add-ons or probably will be soon enough.",
      "",
      "Darren Bent – £10m with add-ons (Tottenham, August 2009)\nSteven Fletcher – £12m with add-ons (Wolves, August 2012)\nDidier N’Dong – £13.8m (FC Lorient, August 2016)\nEnzo Le Fee – £19.35m (Roma, June 2025)\nHabib Diarra – £27m (Strasbourg, July 2025)",
      "Enzo Le Fee became Sunderland’s record signing after their promotion back to the Premier League. They will hope they don’t lose quite so much n’dosh on him as N’Dong. They then broke the record again for midfielder Diarra.",

      "Richarlison (£50m rising to £60m) was theoretically capable of usurping Ndombele, but that would make this collection only slightly less damning.",

      "One or both of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano probably belong here somewhere, but we’ve no idea of their actual fees. West Ham paid £20m in compensation to Sheffield United and £5.5m in Premier League fines over the third-party ownership fiasco with Tevez and that alone would qualify.",

      "",
      "Aaron Ramsey\nA significant knee injury has limited Ramsey to 18 appearances for Burnley since he made his £14m move in August 2023.",
      "“It feels so amazing to be back on the pitch, it feels like a dream,” he said after making a six-minute cameo in the club’s penultimate game of their promotion season.",
      "Unai Emery’s presence has likely contributed to Aston Villa adopting the more European approach of baking buy-back clauses into many a sale, especially those of young, homegrown players whose development could be accelerated by regular minutes elsewhere.",
      "But they will not be cashing in their Ramsey receipt any time soon, although his long-awaited return might prompt them to keep tabs again.",
      "",
      "Diego Moreira\nIt seems fairly pointless for Chelsea to insert a buy-back clause into any sale they make to Strasbourg, a club with whom they share owners and have loaned or transferred ten players since summer 2023.",
      "But when Diego Moreira was shipped across to France for £1.7m he arrived safe in the knowledge Chelsea at least had an eye on his future progress. Two goals and seven assists en route to Champions League qualification did not sufficiently move them.",
      "",
      "Bobby Clark\nOne of Jurgen Klopp’s 42 children at Liverpool, the son of Lee made waves at Anfield including playing 48 minutes as a substitute in the 2024 League Cup final, before unseating Trent Alexander-Arnold as the club’s youngest European goalscorer and guaranteeing himself a future mural in the process.",
      "Liverpool were loathe to lose Clark but, as ever with transfer negotiations, ensured the situation was weighted ludicrously in their favour when the inevitable happened.",
      "As well as a £10m fee which constituted one of the highest ever paid in Austrian league history, Liverpool got Salzburg to agree to a 17.5% sell-on clause and buy-back option.",
      "It remained untouched through a season which featured one goal, two assists and a Pep Lijnders sacking in 25 appearances.",
      "",
      "Ben Gannon Doak\nLiverpool have always enjoyed chucking buy-back clauses into their player sales without it ever really seeming likely they would be triggered. But this summer feels different – at least they hope so.",
      "Perhaps Doak will follow the same path as Rhian Brewster before him in struggling under the weight of expectation and injuries. He would not even be the first Liverpool forward whose rise stops and irreversible fall starts at Bournemouth; the tale of Jordon Ibe is a warning.",
      "But Liverpool have been remarkably eager to let the world know how highly they rate a player given four starts and six sub appearances in three years at Anfield, with a decent Middlesbrough loan in between.",
      "Bournemouth felt compelled to hand over £20m and £5m in add-ons after scanning that CV; Liverpool were never going to sanction a sale unless it outlined in writing an opportunity to bring him back.",

      "Jarell Quansah\nThe buy-back clause has become a prerequisite to bring Liverpool to the negotiating table for their homegrown products – or at least those plucked from other academies at a young age.",

      "It is unknown whether Leverkusen faced the same obstacle when they came calling for Quansah but the Germans seemed content to agree to whatever demands were laid out in front of them.",
      "A £30m deal with £5m in add-ons gives Liverpool, at worst, a sizeable fee for a player with 58 senior career appearances, with the best-case scenario handing them control over a substantial centre-half asset if Quansah comes good with some Bundesliga seasoning.",

      "Doyle will sit snugly in between at £7.5m if the add-ons in his deal are activated, by which point Manchester City will either be gleefully contemplating a 20 per cent sell-on clause or buy-back option for a defender who literally never played for them.",
      "",
      "Willy Kambwala\nThere are few areas in which Manchester United have definitely improved their operations over the last few years, but they are absolutely better at engineering more advantageous sales.",
      "Kambwala played ten games for Erik ten Hag through an injury crisis in 2023/24 but remained low down the centre-half pecking order and had rejected a new contract offer so the teenager was sold to Villarreal for a deal worth £9.6m, with a healthy sell-on clause and three-year buy-back option.",

      "Hannibal Mejbri\nGary Neville would absolutely like to see Hannibal lecture the Manchester United squad on the importance of kicking Liverpool players but that violent cameo ended up being the highlight of the midfielder’s 13-game Old Trafford career.",
      "It could be revisited down the line as the Red Devils this time negotiated a £9.4m fee and 50% sell-on clause to go with their now standard buy-back option. Manchester United could have a hell of a team one day if all these offloaded talents realise their potential simultaneously, as those who leave immediately tend to.",
      "",
      "Mason Greenwood\nAs the Daily Telegraph reported in July 2024:",
      "‘There is also a buy-back option in the agreement with Marseille. These are fairly routine nowadays where the sale of academy graduates or young talents are concerned but, given Greenwood’s history, the decision to include a buy-back clause could be perceived as somewhat contentious.",
      "‘Nonetheless, Telegraph Sport understands there is no expectation or intention of Greenwood coming back in the future and that, if the clause does signify the door remains ajar for the player down the line, it is very much the slimmest of cracks. The prospect of it being activated is considered very low.’",
      "A huge sell-on clause entitling Manchester United to 50% of any profit Marseille make on £26.7m signing Greenwood is far more relevant, especially if Liverpool act on their reported interest. Which they absolutely shouldn’t and won’t but still.",
      "The agent and mother of Adrien Rabiot has slammed Marseille, accusing the French club of double standards relating to the midfielder and Mason Greenwood.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid are ‘close’ to signing a Liverpool star, while Fabrizio Romano claims two more Reds stars are set to leave.",

      "Florian Wirtz is the most expensive attacking midfielder in history by an absurd margin but Eberechi Eze has helped Arsenal crack the top five too.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – £100m/€116m (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, June 2025)\nAs statements of intent from defending champions go, it’s a chunky one as Liverpool add the most expensive AM in history to a squad that cruised to Premier League glory last season.",
      "",
      "2) James Rodriguez – £63.2m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nNever before has a shop window been so successfully deployed as when Rodriguez and his giant pet grasshopper dominated the 2014 World Cup so thoroughly that Real Madrid couldn’t help but make the Colombian the fourth most expensive footballer ever at the time. His next permanent club being Everton remains hilarious.",
      "",
      "3) Thomas Lemar – £63m/€70m (Monaco to Atletico Madrid, June 2018)\nWith failed club-record bids from Arsenal and Liverpool in his back pocket, Lemar took his eternal search for justice to Spain and Diego Simeone has not let him go since.",
      "",
      "4) Dominik Szoboszlai – £60m/€69.8m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2023)\nNeeding to remodel their entire midfield, Liverpool first signed Alexis Mac Allister at an apparent knockdown price before mulling over the release clause of Szoboszlai and pulling ahead of Newcastle to trigger it before expiration.",
      "",
      "5) Eberechi Eze – £60m/€69.4m (Crystal Palace to Arsenal, August 2025)\nAn injury to Kai Havertz on the opening weekend perhaps swayed Arsenal, who were among those happy to let Eze’s £68m release clause expire with the intention of possibly agreeing more favourable terms. The Gunners would be happy to pay £7.5m in add-ons if they are linked to trophies and such.",
      "",
      "6) Kaka – £56m/€65m (AC Milan to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nThe world’s costliest signing of all time – at least for a couple of weeks. After a planned £91m move to Manchester City on £500,000-a-week wages collapsed the previous January, Kaka went for a slightly more modest fee and delivered even less flashy numbers: 29 goals, 39 assists, 120 appearances and two trophies in four years before heading back to the Rossoneri on a free.",
      "",
      "7) Bruno Fernandes – £55.6m/€65m (Sporting to Man Utd, January 2020)\nAdd-ons have already far surpassed the initial £46.6m fee, with Sporting potentially due another £12.7m if Fernandes wins the PFA Player of the Year award or makes the Ballon d’Or top three. Manchester United could have doubled their money but knew they couldn’t afford the risk.",
      "",
      "8) Mason Mount – £55m/€64.2m (Chelsea to Man Utd, July 2023)\nA year from free agency and yet Manchester United’s desperation led them to pay a fair whack for the England international and Champions League winner. He has shown little since.",
      "",
      "9) Oscar – £52m/€60m (Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG, January 2017)\n“Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.” Fair play, although that continental comeback will probably never materialise now he’s back in Brazil.",
      "",
      "10) Dani Olmo – £51m/€60m (Leipzig to Barcelona, August 2024)\nThere have been registration issues owing to his new club’s continued financial difficulties but when Olmo has been able to play he has contributed healthily, with 12 goals and seven assists in a disrupted debut season.",
      "",
      "11) Otavio – £50.5m/€60m (Porto to Al-Nassr, August 2023)\nA star of the Saudi Arabia summer transfer window that was, Otavio has fared well enough but rumours persist over a return to Europe.",
      "",
      "12) Zinedine Zidane – £46.6m/€76m (Juventus to Real Madrid, July 2001)\nWith Spurs presumably unwilling to let Tim Sherwood go, Real Madrid had to settle for second best and a man absolutely dripping in Galactico rizz.",
      "",
      "13) Teun Koopmeiners – £46.1m/€54.7m (Atalanta to Juventus, August 2024)\nShortly after being crowned a Europa League winner, Koopmeiners made the move one place up the Serie A table to accompany The Old Lady on their continued hopeful journey towards relevance.",
      "",
      "14) Gylfi Sigurdsson – £45m/€53m (Swansea to Everton, August 2017)\nPart of the single greatest season of Premier League club-specific signings, with Everton also bringing in Davy Klaassen (£23.6m), Henry Onyekuru (£6.8m), Sandro Ramirez (£5.2m), Jordan Pickford (£30m), Michael Keane (£25m), Wayne Rooney (free), Nikola Vlasic (£8m), Cenk Tosun (£27.5m) and Theo Walcott (£20m).",
      "",
      "15) Bernardo Silva – £43m/€50m (Monaco to Manchester City, May 2017)\nThe Portuguese has tried to leave almost every summer since but 14 trophies and more appearances under Pep Guardiola than any other player ever has been a fair consolation prize.",
      "",
      "16) Cole Palmer – £42.5m/€50.4m (Manchester City to Chelsea, September 2023)\nIt seemed like a ridiculous move at the time but was until recently the one unqualified transfer success of this Chelsea regime. Forty goals, 27 assist, 91 appearances and an eternal contract is fine business.",
      "",
      "17) Mesut Ozil – £42.4m/€50m (Real Madrid to Arsenal, September 2013)\nPoor Geraint Hughes must still be having flashbacks after being encompassed by giddy Arsenal fans celebrating the quite unfathomable capture of a Real Madrid star at his peak. Everyone knows how that five-year contract and three-year extension in 2018 played out eventually but there were moments of absolute brilliance first.",
      "",
      "18) Xavi Simons – £42.1m/€50m (Paris Saint-Germain to Leipzig, January 2025)\nAfter a pair of successful loans it was decided that selling club Leipzig would indulge in a spot of record-breaking buying, making Simons the most expensive player in their history by a mile.",
      "",
      "19) James Maddison – £40m/€46.3m (Leicester to Tottenham, June 2023)\nAt one stage the most expensive Premier League signing from a relegated club, Maddison would be fortunate to emulate a former holder of that title in Moussa Sissoko.",
      "",
      "20) Joelinton – £40m/€45m (Hoffenheim to Newcastle, July 2019)\nDoes he belong on the list of most expensive midfielders, forwards or strikers instead? Genuinely not sure. But Eddie Howe has treasured and transformed Steve Bruce’s trash in so very many ways."

An ‘approach’ has been made for the 22-year-old, who would provide cover at right-back and centre-back.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Manchester City\nHonestly, who knows at this stage? Reports say City have joined the race to sign the Palace captain, though a move hinges on the futures of Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji. Even if those two leave, Pep Guardiola still has Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones and Abdukodir Khusanov, while Vitor Reis is out on loan. It’s a World Cup year, so Guehi could prefer to run out his contract in south London, but Liverpool really ought to get their wallet out after Ibrahima Konate’s worrying display against Newcastle.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar amid conflicting reports on whether he would serve as a replacement for the Swede or Callum Wilson. Either way, a move is ‘increasingly unlikely’ as Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",

      "15) 🔽 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "14) Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal.

      "",
      "12) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",

      "11) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",

Which City are likely to encourage given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",

      "9) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent. Savinho was left out of the City squad that faced Spurs on Saturday.",

      "8) 🔼 Piero Hincapie – Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal\nSpurs made a proposal for Hincapie and then it quickly emerged that Arsenal are also keen. Will some hijacking history hilariously repeat itself after the Ebere Eze debacle? That would be quite something and is looking increasingly likely, though the Gunners need to let one or two go before they can land the Ecuadorian defender, who has a 60 million euro release clause.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first and while Spurs are ‘planning a hijack’, that’ll probably fail.",

      "6) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "5) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, though it’s currently being reported that a private ‘meeting’ could lead to a ‘dramatic U-turn’.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Bilal El Khannouss – Leicester to Crystal Palace\nThe Foxes playmaker is being linked with Spurs, Newcastle, Leeds, and probably a few other Premier League clubs but Palace appear better placed while they look for a replacement for Eze with £60million burning a hole in their pocket. El Khannouss was left out of Leicester’s squad to face Charlton on Saturday.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Bayern Munich \nNot another one! Jackson is the latest striker that Newcastle United could miss out on, with Chelsea in agreement with Bayern Munich over a loan deal for their unwanted forward.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnarumma suggests they have something else up their sleeve.

      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",
      "",
      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, £100m)\nIt’s done. Liverpool have smashed their transfer record, which could rise by another £16m. It’s the biggest transfer of the 2025 summer window and surely won’t be usurped.",
      "Moving from the Bundesliga to the Premier League can be too big a jump for some, but in recent years more players have adapted well, including Omar Marmoush and an improved Dominik Szoboszlai. Put it this way: Wirtz will hope to be more like Erling Haaland or Heung-min Son than Jadon Sancho – who he replaces in this XI – or Jean-Kevin Augustin.",
      "Wirtz is absolutely good enough to justify his huge transfer fee, but that kind of money can weigh heavy on some players. We’re excited to see which way he goes.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Liverpool (x2), Manchester United (x2), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1)",
      "Total cost: £989.9m",
      "Most expensive players to miss out:\nPaul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, £89.3m)\nRomelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, £75m)\nJadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nNicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, £72m)\nKai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, £71m)\nWesley Fofana (Leicester to Chelsea, £70m)\nHugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, £69m)\nBenjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United, £66.2m)\nRuben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £65m)\nKai Havertz (Chelsea to Arsenal, £65m)\nBryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United, £65m)\nDarwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64m)\nRasmus Hojlund (Atalanta to Manchester United, £64m)\nRodri (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, £62.8m)\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United, £62.5m)\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, £62m)",

      "Arsenal pair Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke have joined the legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",
      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Alexander Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "28) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "27) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "26) Noni Madueke – £48.5m rising to £52m (Chelsea to Arsenal, July 2025)\nA section of the most ‘entitled’ fanbase in the world ought to have been ashamed at how they rallied against Arsenal’s latest signing of a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "While neither the striker Arsenal need nor the Rodrygo-level wide forward they wanted, Madueke will provide the sort of attacking cover which was painfully lacking in their latest failed title charge.",
      "",
      "25) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "24) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "23) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "22) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "21) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "20) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "19) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "18) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "17) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "16) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "15) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "14) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "13) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "12) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – £60m rising to £67.5m (Crystal Palace to Arsenal, August 2025)\nWhile he will hope to emulate Thierry Henry, having looked up to the Frenchman as an Arsenal academy graduate until his release as a 13-year-old in 2011, Eze has already endeared himself to the fanbase by following in the footsteps of Emmanuel Petit and leading Spurs on.",
      "That long road back to the Emirates opened up when Eze made a personal call to Mikel Arteta before fully committing to their bitter rivals, wanting to confirm that boyhood club Arsenal was not an option.",
      "It prompted a quick and straightforward hijack from Arsenal for a versatile forward who they feel can diversify their attack.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "9) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – £65m rising to £71m (Brentford to Manchester United, July 2025)\nIn a landmark summer for Premier League clubs overpaying for overperforming forwards within the division, Mbeumo was always likely to lead the pack after six excellent seasons with Brentford culminated in a 20-goal campaign.",
      "Newcastle withdrawing from the race when the Frenchman made his preference to move to Old Trafford clear should theoretically have made a deal easier and perhaps less expensive to strike. But no.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who was eventually turned into glue after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish stole the show as Everton won their first game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium against hugely wasteful Brighton.",
      "Arsenal won at Manchester United and there were ’emotional reactions’ all over the shop, not most from Declan Rice.",
      "Liverpool are required to break the British transfer record to sign Alexander Isak this summer but he would be ninth on a list adjusted for football inflation.",
      "Man City are reportedly lining up a bid for a new winger after Fabrizio Romano gave Jack Grealish’s move to Everton his ‘here we go’ confirmation.",
      "Manchester City paid a record fee for Jack Grealish before squashing his individuality due to fear. Everton can take advantage and harness the maverick.",
      "Everton have intensified efforts to sign Man City winger Jack Grealish and are not put off by his £300,000-a-week wages, according to reports."

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and after the second weekend, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "10) Richarlison (2)\nYou would have got incredibly long odds on Richarlison winning the Golden Boot two weeks before the season but he has been immense so far, scoring twice in that simple opening win over Burnley and then impressing again as Spurs won at Manchester City. He will take some shifting from that starting XI by Dominic Solanke.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "5=) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "5=) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (2)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "3) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (2)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres, but it’s all evened out as players have caught up with the Norwegian.",

      "",

In Chelsea’s case that means Axel Disasi, Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka, Raheem Sterling and David Datro Fofana. They include Mykhaylo Mudryk, mind.

      "Manchester United: 31\nNo repeat of the underhand Chelsea trick here: All of Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho are listed as being part of the first-team squad, presumably ready to emerge again when Ruben Amorim is inevitably sacked.",

Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall became grey-haired, grizzled veterans after pulling through an injury crisis for Ange Postecoglou, and they will soon be showing the likes of Melia the ropes for Thomas Frank.",
      "They will have to wait a little while for Melia, whose move as the League of Ireland’s record sale cannot be officially ratified until he turns 18 because Brexit. That’s so long, in fact, that said Irish transfer record has already been broken.",
      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",
      "",
      "Geovany Quenda (Sporting to Chelsea, £42.1m, June 2026)\nManchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "Denner Evangelista (Corinthians to Chelsea, £11.5m, June 2026)\nThe cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",
      "Chelsea swooped in despite the Brazil youth international star having not yet made his senior debut for Corinthians.",

But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

      "Victor Ozhianvuna (Shamrock Rovers to Arsenal, £1.73m, January 2027)\nArsenal were linked with future Spurs signing Melia as part of their drive to become a landing spot for Ireland’s best young talents. They lost out in that race but managed to secure a pre-contract deal with Ohzianvuna.",
      "Club Brugge offered an immediate exit and path to the first team while Arsenal cannot bring the versatile midfielder in until after he turns 18 in January 2027, but all parties felt another year or so developing in Ireland before moving would be beneficial.",

      "Man Utd will reportedly ‘agree two deals within days’ after Altay Bayindir continued to keep his place in net for the Red Devils against Fulham.",
      "The Red Devils have had a poor start to the new season with Ruben Amorim’s side losing to Arsenal in the opening weekend before being held to a draw against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "It is not the start Amorim would have wanted after the Man Utd board decided to put their faith in him this season despite a 15th-placed finish last term.",
      "Andre Onana failed to impress in goal last season as he made a number of glaring errors and Bayindir has started both of the Red Devils’ first two matches this campaign.",
      "But Man Utd legend Gary Neville was not happy with what he saw from the Turkey international, who was at fault for Arsenal’s goal at Old Trafford last weekend, when Bayindir flapped at a Fulham corner but Rodrigo Muniz could not take advantage.",
      "READ: Mailbox: Man Utd fans are ‘deluded’ or trying to win ‘I told you so’ trophy",
      "After his side’s draw at Craven Cottage, Man Utd boss Amorim told reporters: “I am focused on our goalkeepers. Like every manager I look at the amount of training, what I see in pre-season, in the games and try to decide who is the best goalkeeper to use in a game and I am going to continue to do that.”",
      "“You can look at it both sides,” he said when asked about Bayindir being targeted at corners. “We have a goal with a goal kick, we have two situations where we could manage to score, a penalty and the corner kick. In every game in the Premier League, you will always have situations in the corners.”",
      "And now Football Insider claims that Man Utd are ‘to agree two goalkeeper deals within days’ after their disappointing result against Fulham.",
      "Man Utd ‘will sell one of their current goalkeepers in the next few days’ while Senne Lammens is ‘expected to join’ from Belgian side Antwerp before the deadline.",
      "Football Insider adds: ‘Both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir are at risk, with Tom Heaton likely to stay at Old Trafford as the third-choice option.",
      "‘Sources say that Lammens is coming in as a long-term project for the Red Devils, to provide competition and back up for the number one keeper.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano brought the latest on Lammens on his YouTube channel overnight, the transfer expert said: “Manchester United remain focused on the opportunity to bring in a new goalkeeper before the end of the window.",
      "“The player they want is Senne Lammens at Royal Antwerp. My understanding remains that the player is keen on a move to Manchester United, contacts took place again on Saturday with Manchester United and Antwerp. The two clubs are talking, at the moment, not yet a done deal but advancing.",
      "“The agreement with the player is okay, club to club negotiating. They started at €17 million plus €3m in add ons. Now Antwerp are asking for something close to €25m. So there is negotiations ongoing on the transfer fee and the details of the deal. Conversations are ongoing for Senne Lammens to go to Manchester United.",
      "“Let me explain again, that Lammens to Man United doesn’t mean that Andre Onana is leaving because he remains an important player for United and there are no concrete negotiations taking place. At the moment the situation has not changed.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘accelerate’ for their ‘clear priority’ as Ruben Amorim is ‘raging’ at one Red Devils star.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United face missing out on a top transfer target as a European giant have ‘submitted’ a hijack ‘offer’ at the last-minute.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Gary Neville reckons Andre Onana could ask to leave the Red Devils with Senne Lammens edging towards a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd are ‘actively work hard’ to find a new club for their goalkeeper with their fifth summer signing ‘almost done’.",
      "A Man Utd star has been ‘offered’ to Bayern Munich as Romano reveals a top Red Devils target has ‘said yes’ to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim kept coy on a new Man Utd’s hunt for a new goalkeeper but warned the club’s bomb squad it’s on them to secure exits."

      "Manchester United fans seem to fall into two camps: Those who believe in magic and those who want to be right about Ruben Amorim.",
      "Now watch Newcastle v Liverpool and send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Are Man Utd fans trying to win ‘I was right’ trophy?\nI mean, that the mess at Old Trafford shows no signs of abating is of course tremendously entertaining, but FFS people, it’s two games into the season. Lost to Arsenal after more than matching them (and IMO it was a foul on the keeper), and drew away to a Fulham team that was four places higher and 12 points better off last season. New attack not gelling yet? It doesn’t happen overnight, fellas.",
      "I don’t think Amorim is the right guy, I never have done. I get the Villas Boas vibes too off him, and I believe that he is just another notch on the bedpost of failure at OT, but your board just gave him £200m to spank, and people are calling for his sack two games into the season? Have you lot learned nothing? He has to be given a chance to succeed, or, as is more likely, fail, and to turn your collective backs on him before August is over is insanity.",
      "The ever more deranged Badwolf is going to have a new condition named after him, such is the poor fella’s descent into despair caused by his beloved team’s fall from grace:",
      "“Why’s that man walking so strangely?”",
      "“Poor fella literally doesn’t know his arse from his elbow, worst case of Badwolf syndrome I have ever seen.”",
      "…and countless others are lining up to write the season off and call for the manager’s head and it seems more important to them that they are proven “right” (whatever that really means) than backing the manager, a manager who inherited a disjointed squad going backwards just a few months ago. There are unwritten rules to supporting a team, and the first one is that you, well, support them. Instead, we seem to have a core who seem to revel in slagging off the manager and many of the players, whilst leaving Brexit Jim – who has enough oversight here to be the actual scapegoat that people should be blaming – virtually unscathed.",
      "Yes, it’s probably going to end in tears, but it sounds to me as though the fans lining up to slate Amorim want this to happen at this point, just so they can “win” something. Anything. The “I told you so” trophy?\nMat (modern football fans are rubbish)",
      "",
      "Amorim is done\nNo idea who is next, but the experiment has failed. Don’t string it along, don’t strategically wait, get him gone and move forward. Every other club can do it, United can too.\nRyan, Bermuda (genuinely surprised Amorim failed this badly)",
      "",
      "…Lots of reaction to how bad United were/are.",
      "I’ll add that I think they are in more than a slump. Why?",
      "1. 28 points from the last 29 games",
      "Extract from that what you will.\nCulk the Younger",
      "",
      "Five points on average Man Utd\nFirstly, I had to stop watching the United game yesterday for my own sanity. After the first half, I could see they weren’t going to win the game, and you can just see the confidence and quality of the team is just very low.",
      "Secondly, Fernandes blaming the referee on missing his penalty because it disrupted his ‘routine’ says it all. How he said that with a straight face in the interview is beyond me. Is he being serious? He’s been great at taking pens over the years, but just own up and say you messed up instead of being a child about it. Excuses are already coming out instead of admitting drastic improvements are needed.",
      "Five points I would like to make on this team and Amorim as well",
      "1. How are Shaw, Mount and Casemiro starting matches? Come on, all three of them are physically incompetent, and just not good anymore. Maguire, Heaven or Mazraoui ahead of Shaw please and give Mainoo or Ugarte some minutes given they can actually run.",
      "2. Fernandes can’t play CM, he has to be one of the CAM’s. He doesn’t have the discipline to play in the middle in the 3-4-3 system Amorim desires to play, but actually plays well as a CAM or a number 10.",
      "3. Why is Amad playing wingback? He isn’t a wing back and is a pretty good winger. Seriously just switch it up to 4-3-3 as the formation as well. If this formation doesn’t work, play De Ligt with Yoro as the CB’s, with Mazraoui RB when he is back and Dorgu LB as the starting defenders.",
      "4. No players sold this summer says it all. Sancho, Garnacho and Antony are all getting exactly what they want, Shaw shouldn’t be at the club anymore, Mount is rubbish and I could easily name a few more who need to be on the transfer list. Selling Garnacho is a big mistake. He’s actually a good player, and yes the attitude seems to be a big issue, but find a way of managing him. He can play on the right or left too and actually have some pace and technique to trouble defenders.",
      "5. Our fan base is a laughing stock. We are sounding more deluded than the peak years of AFTV. The amount of people who said in pre-season we are going to challenge for the title or win some trophies this season are just living in another world. Based of what are they saying this! United will be lucky to finish in the top half this season. Yes there is no European football for United this season and will have time to prepare for matches, but I don’t think it will make too much a difference.",
      "Some players are doing the same as they have done to our previous managers, and the tone from the top seems to be even worse than it was when the Glazers were in charge of decisions. Amorim is out of his depth and came to the wrong club, or only came for the same reason so many other players come to United, for a very good remuneration package.",
      "Oh and I’d like to add that Amorim seems to want us to have an unstable keeper. Every time a corner comes into the United box, it’s a complete mess. Coach the team how to defend corners and sign a keeper that can actually catch a bloody football…",
      "Yes it’s two games in, but we have seen it all before with United hyping themselves up and just being utterly shite. Let’s see what Amorim can do, but he needs to first of all try and win two league games in a row, something he hasn’t been able to do since arriving in November last year.\nRami, Dubai (Different year, same arrogant United)",
      "",
      "Man Utd make you hate football\nWatching Man United is like being at the airport going waiting to fly home feeling miserable for that 2 hours.",
      "No excuses it’s actually making me hate football and have loved football for 30 years.",

      "Dermot Watch\nNot a lot to report on this week’s Dermot watch, of course he agreed with 80-90% of the on field/VAR decisions and the only ones he didn’t agree with were the blindingly obvious errors, e,g, VDV’s “tackle” on Bobb. He did review Trafford’s handball/assault but never really gave a definitive answer?",
      "There were however a few absolute gems even for Dermot and I again use these as examples of the hilarity that can ensue.",
      "When reviewing the disallowed Brentford goal, Dermot felt that the on field decision stands as there is not enough to say it’s not a foul. He and Jay then compare this to Arsenal’s goal last week and the Saliba foul on Bayinder. Dermot states that “well it is a foul isn’t it”, just one little problem here, seven days ago Dermot declared that it wasn’t a foul and Bayinder needed to be stronger, what chance do we have when the “expert” can’t be consistent.",
      "Secondly, a decision he did actually state was wrong. The foul on the WBA striker, “scythed down” (Dermot’s words) but not given as a penalty. Dermot states that “the referee has to question why the player has gone down, what’s caused that, he’s in possession of the ball, why would he go down?”. Fast forward a couple of minutes and Dermot is in full praise of the referee for “a great spot” as he books the Stoke forward for a dive when attempting to round the goalkeeper. But surely the referee should have awarded the penalty, allowed it to be overturned and then book the player, after all he has to question why the player has gone down, what’s caused that, he’s in possession of the ball, why would he go down? Didn’t take him seven days to change his mind on this one, could it be that the referee actually got it right?",
      "Finally, he states that Adringa correctly escaped punishment as his “slap” was non violent. Jay points out that had the Burnley player theatrically gone down then the referee might have reacted differently. Dermot agrees and says “that’s a completely different decision”, what???? A different decision for the same incident because a player cheats?\nHoward (is he Dave from the Fast Show) Jones"

      "Everton should know better over Jack Grealish, while Thomas Frank and Brentford are both thriving. But West Ham and Ruben Amorim look utterly hopeless.",
      "",
      "Everton\nIf Everton supporters had not already connected with Jack Grealish on a spiritual level after his inspirational first start, those post-match comments must have made them feel seen and heard.",
      "“I think maybe at times in the last couple of years I’ve not fallen out of love, but didn’t enjoy football as much as I should,” he said. “I absolutely love football and I want to have that feeling again when you get up on a match day and can’t wait to get out there.”",
      "It’s the same feeling those fans have chased for years. They needed that as much as Grealish, with the new stadium a perfect backdrop to their consummation.",
      "One of the first rules of football is to never fall for a loan signing but Everton really are pretty much helpless here.",
      "",
      "Thomas Frank\nIt would be a foolish oversimplification to state that Frank has displayed more tactical malleability in three games as Spurs coach than his predecessor managed in two years.",
      "But it really does feel as though Frank has displayed more tactical malleability in three games as Spurs coach than his predecessor managed in two years.",
      "Of course he hasn’t. Ange Postecoglou planned and executed these performances and results on occasion and even won at the Etihad without conceding, as the prophecy dictates any Spurs manager must.",
      "But Frank’s flexibility in devising a gameplan not just to nullify the strengths of such diverse opponents as Paris Saint-Germain, Burnley and Manchester City but to more specifically accentuate the strengths of his own players is what a great many supporters wanted more often from the previous regime.",
      "There should always be a certain philosophy and style at the heart of it, the same principles which run through and define whatever team the manager picks. Frank outlined his in that memorable Monday Night Football segment two years ago focusing on how he would set Brentford up to face Manchester City away.",
      "The idea behind his appointment centred around transposing that to a higher level with better players. Curse Daniel Levy for he might have nailed it.",
      "",
      "Brentford\nWhat a difference a week makes. Keith Andrews said Brentford “produced a performance that was us” against Aston Villa, having lamented how the Bees were “a little nice” and “naive” in the defeat to Nottingham Forest.",
      "Those were not adjectives which have often been associated with Brentford since their promotion, even if a sort of identity crisis was understandable after a summer of immense change.",
      "Brentford won far more of their duels – especially in their own defensive third – and it provided a greater base from which they could build. Their goal was a beautiful and basic – a long kick from the keeper and flick-on – and they weathered the storm for over an hour to protect that deserved lead.",
      "Even the disallowed goal lashed in by Mikkel Damsgaard from a long Michael Kayode throw which left Emi Martinez prone was stirring proof that you can raid individuals, but you cannot kill an idea so easily.",
      "The one shot Brentford had from the 28th minute had a better xG than 13 of the 16 Villa mustered in that same time. Perhaps home comforts offered a timely reminder of what they do best.",
      "",
      "Chelsea without Cole Palmer\nHaving failed to score in the three previous Premier League games Cole Palmer did not start, Chelsea needed that.",
      "Their talisman’s durability meant that sequence stretched all the way back to December 2023 but proof of strength and variation beyond the main attacking cog in their machine was overdue with or without him on the pitch.",
      "Enzo Maresca “didn’t want to take the risk” with Palmer and the fact he didn’t feel he had to was encouraging. This might even afford the England international the break his sustained form has long suggested he needs.",
      "Five different scorers stepped up to assume responsibility; it was a far cry from when Mauricio Pochettino implored his squad to “show this is Chelsea Football Club, not Cole Palmer Football Club” before a 5-0 defeat to Arsenal in April 2024.",
      "And there is a story to be told in Chelsea’s prior five-goal Premier League win, when they also recovered from the concession of an early goal to thrash Southampton away last December. The five different scorers that day were Palmer, Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Noni Madueke and Jadon Sancho.",
      "It has come at ludicrous expense but this is a team transformed and quickly maturing.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nThe perfect riposte to the wider noise surrounding the opening weekend. Another clean sheet against a relegation-battling United was this time supplemented by a show of proper attacking force Arsenal have not exerted for what feels like an age.",
      "It had all the hallmarks of what is likely to become their trademark brand of victories alongside scrappy 1-0s this season: set-piece goals, a penalty, some Viktor Gyokeres fun and even a couple of celebration-tempering injuries in attack.",
      "After beating Manchester City 5-1 at the Emirates in February, Arsenal scored more than two goals in just one of their next 15 Premier League games – away at Ipswich in April. This sort of thrashing has become their calling card under Mikel Arteta and entirely justifies those 90-minute grinds.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth\nThe argument with Wolves was won long ago; not a single soul still believes Bournemouth might have made a mistake over Gary O’Neil.",
      "But the trade-up for Andoni Iraola continues to prove masterful. His coaching has safeguarded against a level of squad upheaval few can match. Only Chelsea have accrued more in transfer fees than Bournemouth this summer yet the Cherries remain a clear and established force.",
      "The majority of those sales were made at the back, with the ageless Adam Smith accounting for more than two-thirds of the combined Premier League career appearances made by the starting defence and goalkeeper which did not struggle to keep a clean sheet.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the only other side to pick the exact same starting line-up across the first two games, yet just Arsenal and Manchester City have used more players than Bournemouth.",
      "Iraola spoke after the game of his improved depth and “options” for good reason; it’s a quietly excellent squad being maximised by a brilliant manager.",
      "",
      "Scott Parker\nThere will need to be imminent evidence that Burnley can make this work against teams they haven’t just been promoted alongside, especially away from home.",
      "But there is also plenty to be said for the momentum and confidence which can be extracted from that sort of victory. The moods at Burnley and Sunderland could not have been more disparate after their mirrored opening-day results and the Clarets redressed the balance in 90 accomplished minutes.",
      "Parker has also now nudged ahead of Mick McCarthy in terms of Premier League points per game. It truly was a weekend Sunderland might never recover from.",
      "",
      "Marco Silva\nWhile he would quite like some new signings – and is far from alone in that regard – Silva continues to create problems for himself by perennially finding solutions.",
      "One third of Fulham’s Premier League goals since the start of last season have been scored by substitutes. After two games they have already salvaged a couple of points with equalisers from the bench. It’s a neat trick.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nOliver Glasner did offer a much brighter outlook on Crystal Palace’s future and how “everybody is working really hard to get the right players in”. There is a strong sense that once the window closes he will be thrilled to be able to just coach without all the nonsense surrounding it.",
      "But Palace really should spend this next week stopping him talking to either Austrian TV or Gary Cotterill. Nothing good can come of it.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo\nShould be replaced by the man in the opposite dug-out but also retains the full and unwavering support of the fans. Much like his predecessor actually; working for Evangelos Marinakis does seem inadvisable.",
      "",
      "Leeds\nDidn’t lose 6-0.",
      "",
      "West Ham\nThe cycle continues. Without significant change at the highest level beyond the loss of their Premier League status, it always will.",
      "West Ham have appointed a coach shorn of tactical identity and charisma, backed them haphazardly at best in the transfer market – it is difficult to think of a worse, more systematically self-destructive window from an established top-flight club – and reportedly given them a game-based ultimatum to figure things out.",
      "There is no smoke without fire and the internal rejection of those stories only intensifies the feeling that this is an irrevocably broken club.",
      "Potter is not good enough to make sense of any of it, but then it is difficult to fathom who else might. The shortlist to replace him will obviously include Rafael Benitez as it always does, a perfect illustration of a club stuck in the mid-2000s and refusing to modernise.",
      "It is a diabolical squad put together with the conflicting ideas of about five different individuals from at least two managerial regimes, a club which generates money in spite of itself and spends it atrociously.",
      "The Declan Rice windfall is a prime example. It should have been used to reinforce their position as a mid-table side with designs on challenging the elite. They signed Edson Alvarez (loaned out), Mohammed Kudus (sold), Konstantinos Mavropanos (an unused substitute twice this season) and James Ward-Prowse (part of the worst midfield in the league).",
      "The 2003 West Ham vintage is still held as the archetypal forewarning of a side being Too Good To Go Down. The 2025 edition really doesn’t look close to being good enough to stay up.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nThe PSR argument does sort of fall in on itself with results and performances like that. These first two games must prompt a great deal more introspection at Aston Villa than has been allowed to take place so far.",
      "It was a horribly undercooked bench and even little old Brentford were able to prove the advantages of having an expensive Premier League-ready signing available; that is the sort of asset Villa in many ways cannot afford.",
      "But there must be better in-house solutions than using John McGinn as an out-and-out winger, using Emiliano Buendia at all or persisting with a system which doesn’t appear to work.",
      "Villa put in 27 crosses, a vaguely impressive feat considering their starting line-up was an affront to width and pace, and a figure they surpassed just three times last season. Only four of them found a teammate yet nothing fundamentally changed in Villa’s approach until Donyell Malen came on to offer some thrust in the final half an hour.",
      "Having almost twice as many shots as Brentford but the same amount on target is ultimately as wasteful as their utterly absurd wage-to-revenue ratio.",
      "",
      "Manchester City\nBetween the bungled deployment of the Pep Lijnders high line and Thomas Frank thanking “awfully clever” Jurgen Klopp for inventing the aggressive high press, it was not the first Manchester City defeat which could be traced back to Liverpool.",
      "But that was a chastening reminder that spending more than £300m in a year does not immediately fix every problem. This is a new team with fresh coaching ideas which will take time to implement and master.",
      "While Pep Guardiola knows he will be afforded that patience based on what he was allowed to survive and come through last season, there remains an uncertainty surrounding Manchester City which has rarely been present under his rule.",
      "And it doesn’t feel like their continued curious pursuit of another keeper to completely undermine their initial succession plan will help decide which of the two teams we’ve seen in the opening weeks is a more accurate reflection of Guardiola’s latest expensive rebuild.",
      "",
      "Vitor Pereira\nThere is sympathy for a manager trying to establish and uphold standards at the highest level.",
      "The coach is privy to information and context that supporters and outsiders are not and if Pereira felt Andre was a necessary sacrifice to that altar based on his commitment and approach to training, with Jean-Ricner Bellegarde granted his place, then those are the choices he is paid handsomely to make.",
      "As Pereira said, game time is not a “gift” and has to be earned.",
      "But this is also not anything close to a squad which can afford to make such statements. It is a confused mess of profiles, nationalities, ages and positions and Andre is likely the best of them, as underlined by the Brazilian’s half-time rescue call after his replacement’s decisive mistake.",
      "Wolves were ultimately better for his presence, even with 10 men. But they look every bit a side which has sold its best forward and defender and spent a fraction of the income speculating to accumulate precious little. You’d struggle to name most of that starting line-up even with a team sheet in front of you.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim\n“We prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal,” said Amorim last week.",
      "He must have known it had to be backed up with victories against Fulham and Burnley before the first international break at the very least, with strong performances a preferred accompaniment.",
      "But the burden of that apparent proof is collapsing in on itself. Amorim has managed 25 Premier League games against sides currently in the division, winning just four and losing 15. It is a farcical record considering the backing he has received and the support he still benefits from.",
      "Maybe signing the league’s two biggest xG overperformers does not fix the attack. Maybe Manchester United should derive a modicum of shame in how freely and publicly their opponents discuss their tactical shortcomings. Maybe Manchester United shouldn’t have built around a player who has no clear role and who can’t take a penalty properly after being nudged a minute beforehand.",
      "And maybe Amorim really isn’t the one to fix this. It is worrying that Manchester United do not appear to have contemplated that possibility for one second, so many of their cracked eggs have they already placed in his basket.",
      "READ NEXT: Amorim sack inevitable as Mainoo joins list of Manchester United sacrifices for absolutely nothing",
      "",
      "Brighton\n“With our younger players a little bit older, Fabian a year in the Premier League, we are hoping for more next season,” said Tony Bloom this summer.",
      "More of the same is not what was planned. Brighton have gamed the system and mastered the market but still cannot consistently crack the code in terms of goals.",
      "Their top scorers last season all scored 10 each and one – their outright top scorer the campaign before – has been sold. For all their brilliance, the only player to ever score more than 10 goals in a Premier League season for Brighton remains Glenn Murray.",
      "That seems unlikely to change this year. Brighton continue to create at as quick a rate as they waste. Danny Welbeck is a wonderful player but never the fulcrum around which an entire attack should revolve, never mind at 34.",
      "And their defence is still unreliable: only three current Premier League clubs have conceded more goals than the Seagulls since Hurzeler’s appointment.",
      "Bloom sanctioned the biggest spend of any top-flight club last season to improve Brighton in the present and that has trickled over into a summer of recruitment in 2025 focused more on the future.",
      "It means £50m worth of teenage Greek strikers remain on the sidelines as Hurzeler does not deem them ready, but the coach has been given a hand his bosses feel is strong enough to be played properly now. The results he is producing suggest otherwise.",
      "",
      "Sunderland\nA necessary reality check after that euphoric opening win and fantasy summer transfer window.",
      "The objective at Sunderland remains survival, even if some supporters should dare to dream of Europe and beyond. An injury to Dan Ballard or being forced to have more of the ball would not bring everything crashing down quite so dramatically if the foundations were sound.",
      "These results will happen and often depend on the sort of chance Eliezer Mayenda spurned in the opening stages. Sunderland might be grateful that the one common theme from their first two games is a need not to overreact.",
      "“Hello, is that Liverpool? We’re just calling to say that we want to negotiate on the Alexander Isak fee…”",
      "Manchester City have raised almost £300m selling players who never even represented them, which is one of the greatest secrets to their success.",
      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Newcastle v Liverpool was fun, right? But Liverpool have got some big issues and probably need Marc Guehi to sign quite soon.",
      "Arsenal have made an ‘approach’ as they eye TWO more signings, and a Man Utd transfer is at the ‘final stages’, while the likelihood of Alexander Isak joining Liverpool decreases…",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘step in the right direction’ following a private ‘meeting’ between Alexander Isak and a ‘PIF delegation’."

      "These seven big-name Premier League players have zero minutes played after two weeks of 2025/26, and have watched at least one match from the bench.",
      "We have ranked them by how p*ssed off they will be after consecutive snubs.",
      "",
      "7) Dario Essugo (Chelsea)\nSigned for a decent fee this summer, Essugo has yet to see a single Premier League minute. The 20-year-old has been left to watch Chelsea’s draw with Crystal Palace and demolition of West Ham from the bench, and must already be fearing the same fate as Lesley Ugochukwu, Carney Chukwuemeka and the rest of the youngsters hoarded at Stamford Bridge before being loaned out and eventually sold.",
      "And we all know the script by now. Say it together: one, two, three…Strasbourg!",
      "",
      "6) Ilkay Gundogan (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola put Gundogan’s omission from Saturday’s squad against Spurs down to rotation, a week after the German sat on the bench while City – and his replacement Tijjani Reijnders – ran riot at Molineux. Journalist Nico Schira claims Gundogan is no longer in Guardiola’s plans, but that’s already obvious after just two weeks of 2025/26.",
      "After seven glittering years at the Etihad, Gundogan left for Barcelona on a free transfer. He impressed in Spain and was re-signed by City a year later, a move we deemed perfect for everyone involved. It turns out we were wrong. For the first and only time ever.",
      "A year on, and back-to-back Premier League snubs suggest a third transfer in as many summers. Gundogan should be more disappointed than angry about the situation: his second City stint looks set to end with him on the fringes, a far cry from 2023 when Guardiola worked tirelessly to convince him to stay. Age catches up with us all, fella…",
      "",
      "5) Manuel Akanji (Manchester City)\nAn unused substitute against Wolves and available but ignored against Spurs, Akanji looks destined for the exit. City have agreed a fee with Galatasaray for the Swiss defender, though personal terms are still to be settled.",
      "The decision is a curious one. Akanji has been versatile and reliable, while Nathan Ake’s fitness record is far shakier, but City seem intent on cashing in while Gala’s interest is strong. Guardiola’s squad is bloated and trimming it is a priority, and Akanji appears to be collateral.",
      "At 30, he’s weighing up his options, but the way this is unfolding would test anyone’s patience. A move to Turkey feels increasingly inevitable, whether it’s his preferred choice or not.",
      "",
      "4) Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United)\nHaving spent every minute of 2025/26 getting splinters on his bum, Zirkzee hasn’t been called upon once by Ruben Amorim. This is despite Amorim chasing an equaliser against Arsenal on matchday one and a winner at Fulham on matchday two. His goal record in England is far from spectacular, but the Portuguese head coach baffled everyone by turning to centre-backs Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven in the 87th minute at Craven Cottage with the score level, while Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo were Right There.",
      "But Zirkzee’s situation is different to Mainoo’s. He hasn’t done enough to prove himself as a top-level player for United, and the big-money arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were always going to push him down the pecking order. The one small consolation is that he hasn’t been cast aside entirely like poor Rasmus Hojlund. But two sunny Sundays on the bench already feel less like rotation and more like a gentle nudge towards the exit door.",
      "",
      "3) Ederson (Manchester City)\n“My future is here. Some friends send me a lot of news but 99 per cent is fake news. I understand, but there’s a lot of fake news around my name. My head is staying at the club. It stays with the City. It gives me everything to go back to the Premier League again and try to win the Champions League as well.”",
      "That was Ederson in June. At the time we said it might not be down to him, and it’s panning out that way. Despite his public declaration, the Brazilian goalkeeper – like Manuel Akanji – is a target for Galatasaray. City seem happy to move him on, leaving him out of the squad entirely for the trip to Wolves amid the speculation before plonking him on the bench for Saturday’s defeat to Spurs. A James Trafford error, Ederson camera pan was inevitable.",
      "Trafford has moved ahead of him in Guardiola’s pecking order, and if Ederson goes, the door opens for PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma. It’s a brutal situation for City’s long-time No.1, whose future suddenly hinges not on his own form or loyalty, but on the availability of a superstar replacement.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nIt’s Groundhog Day for Kiwior, who has started a second successive campaign on the fringes. Left out completely for the Gunners’ opener at Old Trafford, the defender was an unused substitute against Leeds United on Saturday. Last August, Kiwior didn’t make the squad on matchday one and then sat on the bench for another three matches before finally starting in the Premier League on December 4.",
      "There is genuine transfer interest in Kiwior, and a sale would make sense. FC Porto are keen, but Arsenal are right to hold firm for a decent fee. Andrea Berta has the tough task of rebuilding the club’s reputation in the market, and securing good value for Kiwior would be a step in the right direction.",
      "Plenty of Arsenal fans would be content for him to stay – he played an important role in the second half of last season when Gabriel Magalhaes was injured. But the early signs suggest history is repeating itself. With Gabriel first choice, and Riccardo Calafiori and new arrival Cristhian Mosquera also in Mikel Arteta’s squad, opportunities will be limited. A move to Porto looks increasingly likely, and at this stage, Kiwior would be wise to give it serious thought if he wants to play regularly.",
      "",
      "Playing academy graduates is a cheat code for building a connection with supporters, and Mainoo is one of the best to come through at Old Trafford in years. He broke into an equally dysfunctional United side under Erik ten Hag at just 18 and showed incredible maturity and quality to establish himself in the first team. He’s a top talent, and if Amorim can’t find a role for him, that’s on him.",
      "The England international ought to be exasperated watching Manuel Ugarte struggle while Amorim turns to the Uruguayan and defenders Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven as substitutes ahead of him.",
      "That only fuels uncertainty about Mainoo’s long-term future. He remains one of United’s best, most consistent players – even off the back of a difficult season – and is not someone they can afford to lose, even if a sale would be a pure-profit goldmine. Mainoo might love the club to death, but players will always do what’s best for their career. We’re only two games deep, but fans are already annoyed, and you can only imagine how young Kobbie is feeling.",
      "“Hello, is that Liverpool? We’re just calling to say that we want to negotiate on the Alexander Isak fee…”",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is the subject of an ‘ambitious approach’ from the Red Devils’ arch-rivals Leeds, according to reports.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed Kobbie Mainoo’s decision on leaving Manchester United before this summer window closes.",
      "Manchester City have raised almost £300m selling players who never even represented them, which is one of the greatest secrets to their success.",
      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Newcastle v Liverpool was fun, right? But Liverpool have got some big issues and probably need Marc Guehi to sign quite soon."

      "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.",
      "\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.",

      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"",

      "\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",

      "Monday 25 August 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva both felt Manchester United's opener at Fulham should have been ruled out for a clear push by Leny Yoro in the build-up - on an afternoon of officiating controversy at Craven Cottage.",
      "In the pulsating 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage, Yoro appeared to have two hands in the back of Fulham defender Bassey as he met a United corner, before forcing a Rodrigo Muniz own goal. VAR Darren England approved the goal after a brief check.",
      "But Bassey felt referee Chris Kavanagh \"will be disappointed\" when they look back at the decision - especially as the Fulham defender was penalised for a shove on Mason Mount in the first half which gave United a penalty - that Bruno Fernandes missed.",
      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He [Yoro] has got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.\"",
      "\"I cannot understand it. I would love to explain everything to you from the first whistle to the last. But I don't have this. It's not my job, I don't want to go in this direction for everything that went on this afternoon at Craven Cottage.\"",
      "Analysing the United goal on co-commentary duty, Gary Neville said: \"If I was Fulham, I would be asking about the two hands in Bassey's back.",
      "\"Both hands on the back and Yoro is lucky to get away with that, but he will not care.\"",
      "Bassey was also at the centre of VAR controversy as he was accused by the officials of bringing down Mount in the penalty area.",
      "As per PGMOL guidance, referees will award more penalties for holding this season - in an attempt to crack down on grappling at set-pieces.",
      "Referee Kavanagh did not award the shove on Mount in real time but - two minutes after the incident, the official was sent to the VAR monitor during the next available break in play.",
      "\"I still think it's harsh,\" said Bassey about the incident. \"I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",

      "\"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be won, sometimes you're trying to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.",
      "\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.",
      "\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"",
      "Asked if he was relieved at Fernandes then missing the penalty, Bassey replied: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "There was even controversy as Fernandes stepped up to take the spot-kick, with the United captain colliding with referee Kavanagh in the build-up.",
      "Analysing the incident on co-commentary duty, Neville said: \"He picked the ball up, and maybe the referee has given him a bump by accident. And he goes back, it unnerved him a little bit.",
      "\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but [a few seconds later] he was still having a go at the referee, Fernandes - as he feels it was a little bit clumsy. That is maybe what put him off.\"",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.",
      "\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is convinced Manchester United's attack will fire this season. The evidence suggests it will. They threatened to run riot in the opening 15 minutes at Fulham, but a concern is how they've faded in games.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes were purring early on at Craven Cottage. Cunha went close three times. The quartet linked up with speed and precision around the box. They looked sharp.",
      "But it didn't last once Fulham settled and stifled Casemiro and Fernandes with their midfield diamond. Ruben Amorim's substitutions also weren't able to have the same impact as Fulham's, Emile Smith Rowe equalising with his first touch.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench early in the second half but had just one touch in the opposition box - it wasn't a telling one.",
      "Last weekend, United's possession was in the spotlight, racking up 60 per cent against a traditional top-four side for the first time in almost a decade. It helped them get the ball into dangerous areas and fire off 22 shots.",
      "This time it was different, over 10 per cent less as they were out-passed by Fulham, not by much, but with only 10 shots to show from it. Amorim's side remain a work in progess.David Richardson",
      "Jack Grealish received the biggest cheer even before Everton kicked off against Brighton in the first Premier League game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium but the cheers were bigger in the 93rd minute as he left the field after a player-of-the-match performance.",
      "The winger picked up two assists in Everton's 2-0 win - as many as in the previous two seasons combined at Manchester City. Had Dwight McNeil converted a late chance, it would have been a hat-trick of assists for the first time since his Aston Villa days.",
      "\"I hope he has got more of them to come,\" said David Moyes afterwards, acknowledging that Grealish gives this Everton something different. \"The big thing is he ball-carried for us. He retained the ball for us as well which gave us a little bit more composure.\"",
      "It is no great surprise that Grealish showed good technique. The only question was how he would approach this challenge after the disappointment of finding himself surplus to requirements at City. But he showed that he had the stomach for the fight too.",
      "He was tracking back inside two minutes. Putting in a tackle inside his own box just after the hour. \"He was game for it, didn't try to shirk anything, didn't want off after 60 minutes, didn't want any of that,\" said Moyes. \"No chance, he wants to show that he's the real deal.",
      "\"You know, you admire somebody who's saying, he probably has something to prove. I had something to prove, I think, over the years at different times. Sometimes it gives you that challenge that you have to try and be ready to take. Hopefully, Jack is.\"Adam Bate",
      "Anthony Elanga, who? Dan Ndoye is beginning to impress, filling the hole left by the Swede. With two games, he's already registered two goal contributions. After a debut goal against Brentford and an assist against Palace, he became the first Nottingham Forest player to score or assist in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since 1998.",
      "Elanga's attributes were clear and Ndoye perhaps doesn't possess the blistering speed that Newcastle's summer signing has.",
      "However, Ndoye's adaptability will impress Nuno, who can continue to hope for an interchanging and dynamic forward line.",
      "Ndoye's first-half display saw him marshalled out of the game. However, all it took was a tweak from Nuno to switch him and Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ndoye's individual brilliance did the rest to carve out the assist that earned Forest a point.",
      "Nuno wants more in the door in terms of transfers but at present Ndoye for £34m looks like a masterstroke.William Bitibiri",
      "Within the whirlwind that Crystal Palace have caught themselves up in this summer, it's been too easy to forget the fine work that is still being accomplished at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace continued an unbeaten start to the season.",
      "Whether it's the demotion to the Conference League or Palace's biggest stars being linked and in Eberechi Eze's case, securing a move away, the Eagles have navigated a strong start to the season. Their four games unbeaten are reflective of the mentality Glasner has developed in SE25.",
      "A win in the Community Shield saw Palace fight back to take Premier League Champions Liverpool to penalties. Their opening league fixture at Chelsea saw them controversially denied a point at the home of the world champions.",
      "A first game in Europe followed with Eze's future an acceptable distraction but still Palace secured victory. Against Forest, Palace will feel they dropped two points against a side that scored with their only shot on target. But Oliver Glasner will see the positives in their display.",
      "Their start is a total contrast to the beginnings of last campaign, where a slow start brought Glasner into question. Their recent run represents a growing consistency that is going under the radar.William Bitibiri",
      "To not score a goal from an expected goals figure of 2.46 was quite an achievement by Brighton.",
      "Not since Manchester City created 2.92 at Crystal Palace in March 2022 had a team in the Premier League created such a high xG figure without scoring away from home.",
      "Perhaps the footballing gods were working their magic for Everton on their big day so Brighton didn't really stand a chance but Fabian Hurzeler will be worried about the flakiness of his forwards.",
      "Danny Welbeck was responsible for 1.54 of that expected goals figure, missing from almost under the crossbar with the goal gaping and also from the penalty spot.",
      "Hurzeler will be hoping it was just one of those days at the office rather than anything too deep-rooted.Lewis Jones",
      "Marco Silva deserves a lot of credit for how his Fulham side have battled to start the Premier League season.",
      "Two games with two late goals to rescue a point on both occasions, they could have easily walked away empty-handed.",
      "Silva has been vocal about the need for reinforcements within his squad, with Benjamin Lecomte their only addition throughout the summer, and spoke openly about it after full-time against Manchester United, too.",
      "\"We need to sign two or three players,\" he said in his post-match press conference. \"We have eight or nine days to correct some things.",
      "\"We have a lot of games and have injuries; in some positions, we are short.\"",
      "Returns for Antonee Robinson and Ryan Sessegnon, as well as a boost in confidence for Emile Smith Rowe following his goal, will ease the strain on his squad.",
      "However, if they want to start converting draws into wins, fresh faces will be needed.",
      "They had the momentum to win this fixture but just lacked the final push in the latter stages of the game.Patrick Rowe",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "United are winless in their first two Premier League matches after being beaten by Arsenal last weekend and failing to hold onto their lead at Craven Cottage, with the pressure already building on head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "A Rodrigo Muniz own goal had put them in front just before the hour mark despite United defender Leny Yoro pushing centre-back Calvin Bassey in the back with both hands as he headed a corner in off the Fulham striker.",
      "The incident came after Bassey had been punished in the first half for throwing Mason Mount to the floor at a corner while Man Utd's Luke Shaw bundled over Muniz in the same moment.",
      "The game was stopped one minute and 23 seconds later when the VAR Darren England instructed referee Chris Kavanagh to review the incident, and he awarded a penalty.",
      "Kavanagh was involved further when he accidentally collided with Fernandes as the Man Utd captain was preparing to take the spot kick, which he then smashed over the crossbar, looking to find the top left corner.",
      "Fernandes appeared to be upset with Kavanagh disrupting his pre-penalty routine and said afterwards: \"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that's not an excuse for missing the penalty.\"",
      "United were left to rue the chances they missed in the first half. Matheus Cunha had three shots within the opening 14 minutes, whistling a strike from distance over, side-footing an effort against the right post and then forcing Bernd Leno into a fine save after brilliantly controlling Altay Bayindir's long pass forward.",
      "But Fulham more than played their part in an entertaining game, forcing the nervy Bayindir into two significant saves before Smith Rowe came off the bench and tapped in Alex Iwobi's cross from close range with less than 20 minutes remaining to deservedly earn a point.",

      "\"It's the same as my one. It's a foul. He pushed me to stop me from getting to the ball. When the ref looks back on it, he will be disappointed. I can't say too much before I get a fine!",

      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.\"",

      "\"I don't have the words to explain things that are impossible to explain. They did unbelievably well when they saw the penalty. The foul on Rodrigo (Muniz) was half of a second after the push from Calvin (Bassey). I think they were amazing and we have to congratulate them.\"",
