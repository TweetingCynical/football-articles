      "Manchester United prospect James Overy made his first appearance in a senior team training session on Wednesday. United secured Overy on a scholarship deal last summer after beating a number of Premier League rivals to his signature.",
      "In the lead up to the Premier League clash with Chelsea, Overy joined a cohort of promising players at Carrington, including Chido Obi, Godwill Kukonki, Harry Amass, James Scanlon, and Jaydan Kamason.",
      "Primarily a right-back, Overy is eligible to play for Australia, England, and Scotland on the international stage. Reflecting on Overy's journey after his academy debut, ex-U18 boss Adam Lawrence praised his attitude during his time off the pitch.",
      "He told MUTV: \"It's been really hard for James because obviously he's made the move from Australia and he's a terrific lad, first of all.",
      "\"But he got injured in pre-season and you can see he's such a great lad, a great kid and has such good energy and he wanted to be back. A real credit to him because he stayed positive throughout.",
      "\"It's not affected him in terms of his positivity. And listen, it's obviously disappointing what's happened in the game, but for him to be back and playing football again is brilliant.\"",
      "United's youth setup continues to be renowned as one of the finest, with their scouts on the hunt for young talents capable of stepping up to the senior squad.",
      "Promising youngsters are granted scholarship deals, marking a significant step towards the possibility of clinching a professional contract, which they are eligible to sign from the age of 17.",
      "At just 15, Overy turned heads among Premier League scouts with a standout performance for Perth Glory's first team in a pre-season friendly against West Ham in the summer of 2023.",
      "Amorim is likely to turn to a number of youngsters when they take on Chelsea on Friday night. The Premier League fixture comes just five days before their season-defining Europa League final vs Tottenham.",
      "The United boss has made no secret that's where their priorities lie, despite finding themselves in 16th position with just two games to go."

      "Manchester United's stars are said to be unhappy at being offered just two tickets per player for the Europa League final - whilst the travel logistics mean they may not be able to celebrate with their family if they win.",
      "The Red Devils take on Tottenham at the San Mames in Bilbao, but much of the build-up has been dominated by the news that Sir Jim Ratcliffe has continued to be frugal with the freebies. Complimentary tickets are very much at a premium, which has not gone down well with the playing group, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "The club are handing out just two complimentary tickets per player for friends and family - as well as seats on a chartered flight. That will land 60 miles away in Santander on the morning of the game whilst the guests will also be given food and drink at the team hotel.",
      "Their return flight is also from Santander - more than an hour’s drive from Bilbao - and leaves at 2.15am following the final, which means any celebrations are unlikely.",
      "The players can buy up to 10 more tickets from UEFA at face value, which range in price from £200 to £55. But if they took that option they would have to stump up the costs for the additional flights and hotel rooms.",
      "The Manchester outfit could land themselves £100million in revenue with victory in the Europa League, by virtue of landing themselves a spot in the Champions League. Despite that their INEOS chief has continued to watch the costs - a move that has not been well received.",
      "Ruben Amorim will pay for 30 members of his backroom staff at to attend the Europa League final with their families as he looks to remedy the unpopular decision taken by Ratcliffe. He will personally cover the cost for his coaches and physios to bring up to two members of family or friends.",
      "He said: \"You know that we have a lot of things - people leaving, a lot of changing in the staff. In this moment for our club sometimes it is hard to understand when to give and when to take. It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff - it is a really hard position.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"My reaction was to help. Then we talk to the players and the players had the same reaction - everybody wants the staff there and their families there.\"",
      "The finalists have been given an allocation of around 15,000 each and while Spurs are offering a free ticket to every full-time employee, United have only set aside a small number for a staff ballot. Instead they've been invited to a screening in Manchester where they will be offered two free drinks."

      "Former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag is one of the front-runners to take over at Bayer Leverkusen - but is also open to a return to the Premier League. The Dutchman has been out of work since being sacked by the Red Devils earlier this season.",
      "He has been linked with a host of roles including at Borussia Dortmund and former club Ajax. But it appears that a move to Germany could be a realistic proposition for Ten Hag.",
      "According to The Athletic, he has been shortlisted by Bayer Leverkusen as they search for their successor to Xabi Alonso, but he is also willing to explore the possibility of a return to the English top flight.",
      "Alonso, who won the title with Leverkusen in 2024, confirmed his exit from the Bundesliga side last week and is expected to take the reins at former club Real Madrid.",
      "He said: \"This week the club and I have agreed that these two games will be my last two games as Bayer Leverkusen coach. We have been talking during this week, and now is the right moment to announce it.",
      "“We have always had good and direct communication, and now that we have clarity, it is the right moment to say that for sure. It is a moment with mixed emotions, but it is the moment to announce it.\"",
      "Cesc Fabregas is also reportedly admired by Leverkusen chiefs but is expected to remain with Italian side Como for the time being.",
      "That leaves Ten Hag well in the running at Leverkusen, having worked in German football with Bayern Munich II, as Pep Guardiola managed the senior side. But the 55-year-old is keeping his options open, having already hinted in the past that his future could lie away from the dugout.",
      "\"There are so many other things I could do,\" he told SEG Stories. \"Maybe in football, in a new position as a manager. That’s an option.",
      "\"Or maybe something completely different. I've been working with my brothers lately. We have our own company.",
      "\"Or rather, they have their own company. But we also run a company together with our father. That’s also something I love to do. I can now give that more attention and it's also a lot of fun.\"",
      "Ten Hag, commenced his managerial career with Go Ahead Eagles before moving to Bayern Munich II. He has since had spells with Utrecht and Ajax before being appointed Man United boss in 2022.",
      "The Dutchman won the League Cup in his debut campaign, adding the FA Cup to that during his second season. But his third year was a disaster as United endured a rotten start to the campaign, with Ten Hag eventually paying with his job and was eventually replaced by Ruben Amorim."

      "A notorious ex-Manchester United hooligan has revealed his favourite London away day. Tony O'Neill was once dubbed Britain's toughest hooligan and 'the general' of the Red Army firm.",
      "Delving into his experiences on the Webby and O'Neill YouTube channel, part of his 'Fan Culture' series, he explained: \"We had tricky situations but London was always the main focus for United. Every time United were playing there, I would always get there, it would be very rare that I would miss London games because anything could happen.",
      "\"Euston (Station) was always the main focal point and that is why the Red Army in London was hated because when the Red Army travelled you could not control them.",
      "\"We could trust each other and there were some dangerous places to go, and I always say the night games are dangerous to go - and I had some dangerous night games.\"",
      "Once considered a public menace at football grounds, Tony found himself behind bars three times over football-related brawls, with police branding him 'Target Kilo'. His penchant for violence started in the 1970s and his last offence came in 2001.",
      "Since hanging up his hooligan boots, he has penned the titles Red Army General and The Men in Black and taken to lecturing students about choosing a better path in life.",
      "Tony spent his youth embroiled in skirmishes with rival supporters across London, clashing with fans from clubs like West Ham, Millwall, Chelsea, and Arsenal. Yet, out of all the confrontations, one particular group remained firmly etched in his mind.",
      "Despite fierce rivalries with Arsene Wenger's Arsenal and Chelsea under Roman Abramovich’s it was another away day that stood out for him.",
      "He explained: \"Tottenham was my favourite ground. Going there in 72... unbelievable! It is the best ground for a young lad. But going forward throughout my life, Tottenham was always my favourite ground, anything could happen there, it was just great.\"",
      "Tony later found himself on the payroll providing security at Gary Neville's Hotel Football and has even chatted with the ex-United skipper on his channel numerous times.",
      "In reminiscing over earlier times, he also named the notorious Chelsea Headhunters, labelling them a \"violent mob\".",
      "Despite this, to truly illustrate the sheer scale of football hooliganism in the '70s, he pointed out: \"They (Chelsea) weren't the only violent mob, virtually every big club in the first division had violent mobs up and down the country - and it was uncontrollable.",
      "\"And I can't really put into words how uncontrollable it was, every weekend it was happening up and down the country.\"",
      "In 1977, the British government and the Football Association took drastic action to try and stem football violence by making all away matches ticket-only and barring match day ticket sales.",
      "However, Tony was skeptical about the effectiveness of these measures, saying: \"It has never worked. They haven't got a clue. It is a disease. It is there. It gets passed down generation to generation. Liverpool Man United. It is a disease. The hatred gets passed down. Leeds Man United, gets passed down. That's the way it is. Millwall West Ham, gets passed down. You can't avoid it. It will always be there.\"",
      "Despite admitting that things have evolved over the last couple of decades, he reminisced about his earlier days as a fierce young man, claiming: \"That was the society we lived in, the 70s was wild, absolutely wild, there was so much freedom.",
      "\"People got everywhere and the police and government just could not handle it.\"",
      "After sharing the footage, one Tottenham supporter recalled: \"Spurs v United at WHL was always something to look forward to back in the day, United always brought a big and good firm.\"",
      "Another stated nostalgically: \"Spurs was always the big London games for United. Spurs v United used to attract bigger crowds than when we played Arsenal.\""

      "“Let’s see what the end of the season gives us. We always expect the season to be better, but I think many teams are having good seasons and won’t end up with a trophy.",
      "“In the end we're in a final, which is never easy, and we're still in the top four, which is also not easy. At this club, you take it for granted because we have been on top for so many years consistently.",
      "“We caught up with our form a little bit late. We had a great start to the season then we dipped a lot. Now we're catching up again.",
      "“Unfortunately it didn’t last the whole season, like it has before, but we're still there in a fight for the top four and in an FA Cup Final which is never easy. In the end, this season can turn out to be good. We are improving a lot – the final will be tough, as is every final. There's a lot of pressure on both teams, but we're ready.\"",
      "Kovacic has more reason than most in City's squad to lift the FA Cup, having lost all of his previous finals - three with Chelsea and last season with Guardiola's side.",
      "The Serbia star lost three successive finals, from 2020 to 2022, then again last season when City were beaten 2-1 by local rivals Manchester United.",
      "“This will be my fifth final and I will try as always to help the team to achieve the FA Cup trophy,” said Kovacic. “It would be amazing and to play the final at Wembley is always special.”",
      "“For me, every trophy is important, because it’s a different story and journey. The FA Cup is the oldest cup and it’s special. It’s knock-out games and if you have a bad day, you’re out. But we’ve had a good run this season and I can’t wait for the final. ”"

      "Marcus Rashford is more inclined to remain at Aston Villa than seek a move abroad this summer. The 27-year-old, who joined Villa on loan from Manchester United in February, has enjoyed his return to regular first-team football after being sidelined by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Villa have the option to make Rashford's move permanent for £40million, but their transfer plans may depend on which European competition they qualify for. While Rashford had previously considered a potential move to Barcelona, Express Sport reports that his successful stint under manager Unai Emery - during which he has scored four goals and provided five assists - has persuaded him to stay at Villa Park.",
      "Rashford will have input into his future, but the final decision on a permanent move to the West Midlands isn't entirely up to him. Villa might attempt to negotiate down their £40m option, but Rashford's hefty £350,000-a-week wage could be a major obstacle.",
      "This salary would make him Villa's highest-paid player by a significant margin, and it could also deter Barcelona. It's been suggested that Rashford has enlisted agent Pini Zahavi to explore a move to the Catalan club, as there's no certainty that Villa can meet his financial demands - especially if they fail to secure Champions League qualification.",
      "Although Rashford's contract with United runs until 2028, a return to Old Trafford is seen as highly unlikely.",
      "Whether other interested parties will join the fray this summer remains to be seen, following earlier links to Borussia Dortmund, Serie A clubs and teams in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Some Villa supporters are worried that they may have already witnessed Rashford's final appearance in claret and blue due to a hamstring injury he sustained last month.",
      "The forward, capable of playing centrally or on the left wing, undertook a warm-weather rehabilitation programme in Dubai to expedite his recovery, and a return before the season concludes wasn't initially ruled out.",
      "That said, Friday's home match against Tottenham is the last game Rashford is eligible to play in, as Villa head to Old Trafford on the final day.",
      "Rashford returned to the England squad in March after a year-long absence, and getting fit for Thomas Tuchel's second round of games next month is a top priority."

      "Manchester United turned their noses up at a young James Maddison when offered the chance to sign him back in his Coventry days. The Tottenham superstar, 28, has been one of the Premier League's top creative midfielders for a while, after turning heads at Leicester before sealing a £40million move to Spurs in 2023.",
      "But United could have snapped him for a fraction of that price back in 2016. At the time, Coventry were in the mire financially, and were thus forced to sell many of their best players, including 19-year-old prodigy Maddison.",
      "In 2020, transfer expert Ian McGarry, who, at the time, was working as a football consultant for the Sky Blues, claimed he contacted United to see if they'd be interested in bringing Maddison to Manchester, but claimed they \"didn't take any notice\" of his recommendation.",
      "\"When Maddison was in the process of leaving Coventry City because the club's financial crisis meant they had to sell their best players and Maddison even then was considered one of the best players,\" McGarry explained on the Transfer Window podcast.",
      "\"I contacted someone I knew at Manchester United in their recruitment department and said look you’re going to get a bargain here, this guy's going to be a huge player in the future and he's available for around £5m and he's also a Manchester United fan.",
      "\"They didn't take any notice. Manchester United could have had Maddison four years ago. In saying that there's no guarantee he would have developed the way he did at Norwich and then Leicester.\"",
      "Maddison would have almost certainly been lining up against the Red Devils in the Europa League final later this month, but will miss the clash due to injury. The England international was ruled out for the season after limping off in the first leg of Tottenham's semi-final against Bodo/Glimt, meaning he'll have to catch the action from the stands.",
      "\"Gutted. Just absolutely gutted,\" Maddison wrote on social media after learning he'd miss the showpiece. \"We've had our sights on that European final in Bilbao from day one of this campaign. So to accept not being able to take part out on that pitch with the boys is really tough to take.",
      "\"Injuries are just part of this game that can be so cruel at times. But I truly believe that it can be a special night for my football club. Bring on the 21st. All together.\"",
      "Maddison has notched 23 goal contributions in all competitions this season, including 12 goals - the second-best tally of his top-flight career. He's been a bright spark in an otherwise gloomy season for Spurs, who are on course for their worst-ever Premier League finish.",
      "The same can be said of Ruben Amorim's United, who are a place and a point above Ange Postecoglou's men in 16th. For both clubs, the Europa League final represents a shot at redemption, but also an unlikely path to Champions League football next season.",
      "For Maddison, watching from the sidelines will sting all the more knowing how different things could have been - not just in terms of his fitness, but in terms of an Old Trafford career that could have been but never was.",
      "Had United paid attention to McGarry's recommendation all those years ago, the creative spark that's been so often missing in their midfield might have been theirs to harness.",
      "Instead, Maddison stands as a living reminder of United's muddled recruitment strategy - an emblem of the talent they've let slip through their fingers during a decade of drift."

      "Pressed on why he felt United may be better off without Champions League football next season, Amorim said: “That is my feeling - we need more time with the team. We need to arrange a lot of things at Carrington [United's training ground] and we need more time - not think game by game.",
      "“Then we have the squad. We proved this year we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and then be really competitive during the Premier League.”",

      "The Manchester misfit's tenacity could be something Sporting CP boss Amorim would appreciate if combined with more output on the field. Yet despite Antony's efforts to reinvent himself during his loan spell in Spain, it appears it might not be sufficient to secure his career in England.",
      "Red Devils legend Pallister has suggested the out-of-favour winger has fallen prey to his own playing style at United. When Antony was loaned out in the January transfer window, his £82million fee made him arguably one of the worst signings in United's history.",
      "Coming from Ajax on the back of Erik ten Hag's recommendation in the summer of 2022, the player shouldered immense expectations. However, he only managed 17 direct goal contributions (12 goals and five assists) in 96 appearances for United before being shipped off to La Liga.",
      "In stark contrast, he’s nearly matched those figures with eight goals and five assists in just 22 games for Betis. Despite his impressive stats abroad, Pallister has said it's not Antony's mental toughness that's in question among United's loanees.",
      "\"I think Antony is probably better suited to the football that he's playing out in Spain. I liked his attitude when he was here and I know he got a bit of stick, but he was always game, he was always up for a fight.",
      "\"It didn't really work from him here. Some people are better attuned to the foreign kind of football rather than the Premier League.\"",
      "Many supporters might share this same view, considering what they saw of the player during his time in England to date. Now under ex-Man City chief Manuel Pellegrini, he's become an integral part of the team and has helped push Los Verdiblancos towards a Europa Conference League final.",
      "Yet the winger often seemed baffled by Premier League defences. Antony's overreliance on his left boot often led to ineffective displays, and his numbers failed to improve once Amorim took over in November.",
      "It's fortunate for United they have Amad Diallo as an established alternative for the right flank. The Ivorian has been hitting his stride at United over the past year or so, having had his own struggles for prominence at Old Trafford.",
      "United now face the conundrum of deciding their terms to let Antony go given his market value has nosedived since moving from Amsterdam. It's believed United have already snubbed one Betis bid to buy him outright, which implies the sum offered doesn't square with their price expectations.",
      "United are reportedly asking for £40m to part ways with the player, almost half of what they originally shelled out nearly three years ago. The star has expressed his fondness for his current club, telling Mundo Deportivo moving to Seville was \"the best decision\" he's ever made.",
      "Betis' financial scope this summer will depend largely on their ability to clinch a spot in next season's Champions League. Pellegrini's team must secure a place in the top five of La Liga to make the cut, currently sitting just shy in sixth place and trailing by three points."

      "Speaking on The Overlap, he said: “I've genuinely got a sickly feeling about this game next Wednesday. The biggest reason is when I look at every single player in the Tottenham team, when you look at (Dejan) Kulusevski, Son (Heung-min), Brennan Johnson, (Dominic) Solanke, if (James) Maddison was there, (Yves) Bissouma and (Pape Matar) Sarr, (Cristian) Romero and (Micky) Van de Ven, (Pedro) Porro and (Destiny) Udogie, when you look at those players, like-for-like with United's, only Bruno (Fernandes) would get into the first 11 of Spurs.",
      "“I would select every single Tottenham player. The goalkeeper is a 50-50 split because I don't like (Guglielmo) Vicario and I'm not a fan of (Andre) Onana.",
      "“Honestly, Udogie, Porro, Van de Ven, Romero, Bissouma, Sarr, Johnson, Maddison, Solanke, Kulusevski, Son, I would choose every single player of Tottenham's over Manchester United's next Wednesday. That's my worry.",
      "“The one thing that keeps me alive - the likes of a Casemiro, a Bruno, they've got something in them that will step up for a one-off game that means I think that we'll win. But if the players play as they should do, pound-for-pound, Tottenham should win that game.”",
      "Both Spurs and Man United have a Premier League game to play out ahead of the Europa League final in Bilbao next week. United take on Chelsea on Friday evening, with Spurs in action on the same night against Aston Villa.",
      "Who will win the Europa League final? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "The pair are also set to go in different directions when it comes to their potential celebrations. The North London side will host a parade should they claim their first trophy since 2008 but United will not follow suit, with a barbeque at Carrington provisionally planned for players, staff and families."

      "Ruben Amorim is facing an injury nightmare for Manchester United's biggest game of the season, with four defenders missing from training. United take on Tottenham in the Europa League final in Bilbao next Wednesday and could be short on players at the back.",
      "The club's season rests on the result in northern Spain, with victory providing salvation in the form of a place in next season's Champions League. United are 16th in the Premier League, a place above Spurs, following the 2-0 defeat by West Ham on Sunday and are fully focused on the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham game extended their winless run in the league to seven games and brought another bitter pill to swallow in the form of another injury for Leny Yoro. The French defender received treatment on the pitch at Old Trafford in the second half and had to be replaced by Harry Maguire.",
      "\"We have to assess Leny in a better way tomorrow,\" Amorim said after the match. \"He felt something, but it could be a small thing.\"",
      "He was due to undergo a scan to determine the extent of the issue and was conspicuous by his absence at an opening training session at Carrington on Wednesday morning. Amorim could be sweating on other injuries, too, with Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven also not presence in the session.",
      "Dalot suffered a calf injury in the 1-0 defeat by Wolves last month and appears very unlikely to make the Spurs game. \"He has something in his muscle, his calf, he had a sequence of games, he played all the time, we try to manage but the players play a lot of minutes and not so ready to cope with that. Dalot felt something,\" Amorim said. \"We don't know how long he's going to be out. But he's out for these next games.\"",
      "De Ligt picked up a knee injury in the 4-3 loss to Brentford, but Amorim had been optimistic about a swift return. \"It is not a big issue,\" he said. \"That is a good thing. He cannot play tomorrow [vs Athletic Bilbao] and he'll not play on Sunday [vs West Ham] but then we'll check day by day.\"",
      "Heaven has not been involved in any squads since being on the bench against Newcastle on April 13 due to a \"small setback\".",
      "Injuries have been a major problem for Amorim during his debut campaign as United boss, with defence a particular issue. Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui all featured against West Ham, but United are short on numbers in defence.",
      "Amorim chose to play a strong side against the Hammers on Sunday, with Bruno Fernandes partnering Manuel Ugarte in midfield. The Portuguese boss admitted that he still had one eye on the Europa League final and had to manage his squad ahead of Friday's trip to play Chelsea in the Premier League.",
      "\"We want to win and to be competitive, also in the Premier League,\" Amorim said. \"Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury [touches wood] but Harry [Maguire] has. So we have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.\""

      "‌It will be published every Thursday and here is the latest academy news...",
      "Sources have said Lawrence is open to working in a first-team environment or a fresh academy challenge for the next step of his career. The 39-year-old has been offered roles in English Football League first-team coaching set-ups and is currently weighing up his next move ahead of the new season.",
      "Neil Wood was the last high-profile coaching departure from the academy. Wood managed the U21s for three years and he was appointed at Class of '92-owned Salford after his exit.",
      "Lawrence seems likely to take a similar route and could manage a first-team next season.",
      "Head of the academy, Nick Cox, thanked Lawrence for his contribution, saying: \"Adam has contributed greatly to our club throughout his four years at Manchester United.",
      "\"His passion for helping young players to maximise their potential has played an important role in the success of our academy system. We take great pride in supporting and witnessing the development of our staff, Adam is a fine example of that, moving up from the Under-16s to the Under-18s, enjoying success and now being ready to seek a new challenge in the game.",
      "\"The whole of the academy thanks Adam for his service and wishes him the very best of luck for the future.\"",
      "It's understood talks are already under way to find a suitable replacement for Lawrence, with Cox and Jason Wilcox in the process of deciding who could continue his good work at Carrington.",
      "Bendito Mantato signed his first professional contract with United last week, and it was confirmed on Monday that he will represent England at the upcoming 2025 U17 European Championship.",
      "The most talented youngsters in the country have been included in the squad. Mantato is regarded as a rising star at United and he was named on the first-team bench for home and away legs against Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League.",
      "The MEN reported in November that Mantato could be promoted to the first-team by Ruben Amorim and the youngster has subsequently been involved in senior squads.",
      "Academy staff will decide which youngsters deserve to win the Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year award and Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, which both have an illustrious roll of honour.",
      "Last season, Ethan Wheatley won the Jimmy Murphy award and goalkeeper Elyh Harrison won the Denzil Haroun award.",
      "Mantato, Chido Obi, Jaydan Kamason, Gabriele Biancheri, Tyler Fletcher and James Scanlon are among the youngsters who have a chance of picking up an academy prize this term.",
      "I mentioned Edward Ibrovic-Fletcher in an edition of the academy notebook at the beginning of last month, and he was handed his debut for the Under-18s on the final day of their season.",
      "The 16-year-old came on from the bench to play the final 20 minutes against Sunderland.",
      "Ibrovic-Fletcher has a dual heritage in England and Serbia, and he's played for the latter's youth teams. He's an exciting talent and is worth keeping an eye on."

      "Sir Alex Ferguson half-joked that he was \"depressed\" after Manchester United's latest defeat to West Ham United.",
      "Ferguson, who was in the Old Trafford directors' box for the 2-0 reverse, was asked how he was after the listless performance and provided the one-word answer with a slight chuckle.",
      "Sixteenth-placed United suffered their 17th defeat of the Premier League season to ensure that they will record at least their joint-worst top flight finish of 13th since the club was relegated in 1974.",
      "The last time United came 13th was under Ferguson in 1989-90, a season that was salvaged by the FA Cup triumph over Crystal Palace, their first piece of silverware in five years and first under Ferguson.",
      "That sparked a remarkable golden period of 13 titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups, two European Cups, a European Cup Winners' Cup, a Club World Cup and an Intercontinental Cup over the next 23 years until Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim said last month that victory in next week's Europa League final would not \"save\" the club's season amid their awful domestic form.",
      "Ferguson, 83, will step down as a United ambassador after 15 years at the end of the season. The Scot has raked in just over £2million a year from the role.",
      "The United great is still expected to attend games next season. Ferguson has been in attendance for the majority of recent home matches and was also present for the away games against Everton, Tottenham and Liverpool this calendar year.",
      "Ferguson ended a 26-year title drought at United when they became the inaugural Premier League champions in 1993 and the club is certain to go half as long without finishing first come next year.",
      "United have targeted a title victory in 2028, the year of the club's 150th anniversary. Amorim is under contract until 2027 and certain to be under pressure at the start of next term to oversee swift and substantial improvement in the Premier League."

      "Manchester United must win the Europa League to salvage a miserable season, to qualify for the Champions League next season and make it easier to attract high-quality players in the summer window.",
      "The Europa League final at the Estadio de San Mames will have huge ramifications for 2025/2026, and the result of next week's game will influence how the summer transfer window unfolds.",
      "United need to play in the lucrative Champions League. They must sell players regardless this summer, but qualifying for Europe's premium competition would ease some financial concerns.",
      "Selling Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony will also help a great deal. Aston Villa have the option to sign Rashford permanently for £40million. Chelsea will pay a minimum of £20million for Sancho, a fee which could increase to £25m depending on the clauses in his contract.",
      "Antony could be remembered as the worst Premier League signing ever, yet he's somehow exploded into life on loan at Real Betis and looks capable of actually scoring goals.",
      "The Brazilian has rediscovered the form he enjoyed at Ajax and that is only good news for United ahead of the summer. Antony must be sold for £32.5m to avoid a PSR loss on his transfer, but that would make him Real Betis' record transfer and they might not have that capital to spend.",
      "If Real Betis can meet that asking price, United would raise over £90m for those three players, who should be pushed out of the door first. But has everyone forgotten about Tyrell Malacia?",
      "Although Malacia does not have the profile of Rashford, Sancho or Antony because he was signed for €15million (£12.9m), he should certainly be one of the first through the exit door this summer.",
      "Malacia is deadwood and his time in Manchester should be over soon. He joined PSV on loan in the January transfer window, but he's only made six starts in all competitions for the Dutch club.",
      "The left-back was absent from PSV's squad for their last Eredivisie game and he was named on the bench for their two games before that, which all suggests his loan hasn't gone to plan.",
      "United included the option to make Malacia's loan permanent in their deal with PSV, although that now seems unlikely, meaning they will be tasked with finding another buyer.",
      "Malacia previously agreed to join Benfica in January, but talks between the two clubs failed to reach an agreement because the option to buy figure was said to be a major stumbling block.",
      "It's expected to become a stumbling block for PSV, too. Malacia hasn't convinced back in his homeland and another transfer to a lower Eredivisie club will be on the cards this summer.",
      "Malacia was keen to find a temporary switch away to rebuild his form and fitness, having spent 18 months on the sidelines with a serious knee injury that required two rounds of surgery.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Thursday, May 15.",
      "We are just a couple of weeks away from the Premier League season ending and the race for transfers hotting up. On Wednesday, the excitement about the upcoming summer transfer window was on full display as rumours and statements were plentiful.",
      "Leading the conversation surrounding United was Lille's Jonathan David. He announced to his followers on Wednesday that he would be departing the French club on a free transfer.",
      "The striker has scored 25 goals this season and United have been linked with him in the past. Meanwhile, reports have linked United with a move for Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton.",
      "MEN Sport has reported that a midfielder is one of United's priorities this summer with Christian Eriksen expected to leave the club at the end of his contract. Wharton remains one of the most impressive midfielders in the Premier League but his focus will be on Saturday's FA Cup final vs Manchester City.",
      "The race for Victor Osimhen remains heated too with United continuing to be linked with Galatasaray's on loan striker. He scored twice in the Turkish Cup final last night and interacted with a Reds legend after full-time.",
      "Keep up to date with all the latest United transfer news throughout the day in our blog below...",
      "MEN Sport reported on Wednesday that United are looking to make at least three priority signings in the summer transfer window.",
      "Long-term targets Cunha and Delap remain the first ports of call in the transfer window.",
      "They are closely followed by a central midfielder with Eriksen expected to leave at the end of his contract and Casemiro's future still hanging in the balance.",
      "According to Caught Offside, Amorim is a big fan of Palace's Adam Wharton and is pushing the club's interest in the central midfielder.",
      "However, United are not alone in their interest in Wharton.",
      "Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Aston Villa, and Tottenham are all credited with interest too.",
      "Speaking recently on It’s Called Soccer, David admitted that he could adapt to the Premier League if United or another club wanted to take a chance on him this summer.",
      "To be honest, I think I can adapt to every League. Every league has their differences. I think the Premier League is a lot faster and more physical than all the other leagues. But I grew up watching a lot of La Liga. I wouldn’t say that would be my preferred league, but I think that’s a league that I enjoyed watching the most… I think one day, I would like to play there. But will that happen? I don’t know. I’m not opposed to anything, and we’ll just see where the future takes us.",
      "Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, David announced to his followers that he will be leaving Lille at the end of the season.",
      "This has undoubtedly put Premier League clubs needing a striker on the cheap - like United - on notice. With 25 goals to his name this season, United cannot afford to ignore him, surely?",
      "I wanted to tell you myself that after so many years at the club it's time for me to say goodbye. I've had five wonderful seasons here. I know it hasn't always been easy but I hope that my goals and my celebrations have managed to bring you some joy. I would like to thank all of my teammates, all of the coaches - staff, technical, medical team, all of the managers, everyone I have met and spent months with at the club. Thank you very much for everything you have given me personally over the years.",

      "Come back tomorrow for more analysis and opinion on all the latest from Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford reportedly prefers to stay at Aston Villa over moving to a club abroad this summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was largely overlooked at Old Trafford under Reds boss Ruben Amorim, who left him out of nearly all matchday squads following his last appearance on December 12, until he was loaned out to Aston Villa in February. Since moving to Birmingham, Rashford has become a key player for Villa under Unai Emery - contributing four goals and six assists. His campaign was cut short, however, due to a muscle injury.",
      "Our colleagues at The Express claim that his preference is to remain at Villa Park and that any chance of a return to Old Trafford is unlikely.",
      "Old Trafford misfit Antony has been told his future lies in foreign football rather than at Manchester United, despite the positive mindset he continues to show.",
      "It's an attribute Ruben Amorim could do with a lot more of. But while the Brazil international has shown a transformed version of himself on loan at Real Betis, it's perhaps not enough to salvage his future in England.",
      "That's according to Red Devils legend Gary Pallister, who believes the discarded winger was a victim of his own style at United. At the time of his loan departure in the January transfer window, £82million Antony held the reputation as arguably one of, if not United's worst signing of all time.",
      "Read the full interview here",
      "Richard Keys has suggested that Ruben Amorim could soon leave Manchester United after their defeat to West Ham United.",
      "Following Sunday's 2-0 loss to the Hammers at Old Trafford, Amorim indicated doubt about his future should his team's poor performances persist into next season. BeIN Sports presenter Keys contends this attitude confirms his view that Amorim is looking to leave.",
      "Despite reaching the Europa League final, where a win in next Wednesday's clash against Tottenham would secure Champions League football, Amorim himself has acknowledged the challenges of competing in Europe's elite competition next season.",

      "Musa's fine form includes a sensational six goals in 45 minutes against Leeds' U18 side last month, with the Reds winning 13-1. Only Manchester City striker Reigan Heskey, the son of Emile Heskey, has scored more goals in the competition this term.",

      "Former Manchester City financial advisor Stefan Borson has weighed in on the chances of Bruno Fernandes leaving Manchester United this summer.",
      "“I don’t think it’s a case of renegotiating with Fernandes at his age,\" Borson told Football Insider. “He’s already on a very big salary. We know what they’re doing to their overall salary cost.",
      "“So, I think it’s much more about whether they just decide they’re going to keep him or if they’re going to take the fee, whatever that fee is from Saudi. I think it’s very unlikely that the fee will be the sort of numbers that have been speculated. They very rarely pay very big fees of the type that’s been rumoured there. Clearly, they paid it for Neymar, which was a disastrous deal.",
      "“There is some speculation they’re going to pay a very big fee for Kudus from West Ham. We will see about that. They paid a reasonably sized fee for Duran, although that’s a different category of deal given his age and given the striker.",
      "“They have paid very big wages but have tended not to pay very big transfer fees, and we’ll have to see whether that changes this summer. But if they weren’t to, then I think that would be the deal dead as far as Fernandes is concerned. I don’t think United would contemplate selling him unless they could get an extraordinarily large fee anyway.”",
      "As mentioned, Mourinho is interested in Sancho should he become available.",
      "However, United could use Sancho as a pawn in their bid to sign Simons if they are truly interested in him.",
      "A return to the Bundesliga would benefit Sancho more than a move to Fenerbahce and if United were to agree to sell him to RB Leipzig in return for Simons, Mourinho could be left out.",
      "Manchester United-linked Viktor Gyokeres has posted a two-word message on social media. The Swedish international has become one of Europe's top strikers in recent seasons with an impressive record of 95 goals in 100 matches since his transfer to Liga Portugal from Coventry City in July 2023.",
      "Sporting's top scorer has made a significant impact in the Portuguese top-flight this season, with 38 goals and eight assists in 32 appearances. The 26-year-old has been instrumental in Rui Borges' squad, helping Sporting climb to the top of the league with just one game left.",

      "The Dutchman is thought to be keen to join a club in the Champions League which will not be possible at RB next season.",
      "Speaking to the media ahead of Friday night's clash with Chelsea, Amorim gave updates on the three centre-backs Yoro, De Ligt and Heaven.",
      "I don't know if they are going to be available. We are going to try and push because it is the final matches and there is a final. All the players want to play in that really bad. I don't think they will go to Chelsea, but we will have a possibility to have some of them in the final.",
      "On Dalot, he added:",
      "Dalot is trying really bad. I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, a second injury, it is a big thing. We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad. We will see. He is working really hard to get in the final.",
      "He may not be the 'biggest' name on the market but his goalscoring prowess in recent seasons means he cannot be overlooked.",
      "109 goals in 231 appearances is a respectable return and at 25 he holds plenty of resale value.",
      "What's more, on a free, he is ideal for a cash-strapped side.",
      "United may only be looking at Delap and Cunha to strengthen this attack at present, but they potentially will need more than just them to strengthen their team and David is certainly worth a punt.",
      "In big news for United as they look for an affordable striker, Jonathan David has announced he will be leaving Lille at the end of his contract this summer.",
      "This season, the forward has scored 25 goals in 48 appearances for the French club.",

      "United have won just six of Amorim's 25 Premier League games in charge and sit 16th in the table with two fixtures to play. Sunday's 2-0 defeat to West Ham means they have failed to win any of their last seven league games.",

      "Instead, the 40-year-old feels he could get the sack if he doesn't turn fortunes around, with next week's final against Tottenham in Bilbao a chance to start doing just that.",
      "\"What I’m seeing is that since I arrived here I’m always talking about the standards,\" said Amorim. \"I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League and not say nothing and not take the responsibility.",
      "\"It's just that I have a clear idea what to do. I understand the problems of the team, so I’m not, I’m far from quitting.",
      "\"What I’m saying is that we need to perform and, we have this season and in the future we need to perform or else they will change us. That is normal thing.\"",
      "Amorim also suggested that qualifying for the Champions League via winning the Europa League wouldn't necessarily be good for his team, but hedid say that a club of United's stature should be in Europe's premier club competition.",
      "\"Personally for me I think Champions League is more important for everything - to prepare the next season,\" he said.",

We have had so many bad results in the Premier League so the environment is tough in the moment but when we are preparing a game in Europa League the environment is a little bit different.

      "This month, there has been attempts from Spain to unsettle Yoro as a report from Defensa Central claimed that the 19-year-old was regretting his decision to move to United and was instructing his agents to make a move to Real happen. Los Blancos, who look set to be managed by Xabi Alonso next season, have remained on the hunt for a central defender and now look set to focus their attention away from Yoro.",
      "According to several reports, led by journalist Fabrizio Romano, Huijsen looks destined to move to the Spanish capital. On Thursday morning, he reported that Huijsen's camp are flying to Madrid to finalise a deal for their client.",
      "It is understood that Madrid are willing to pay his £50m release clause in three installments and commit the 20-year-old to a five-year contract at the Bernabeu. The journalist also claims that Premier League clubs were interested in keeping the Spanish international in England.",
      "However, the defender gave priority to Real and now the deal looks as good as done. For United, this is the dream scenario as they could not afford to lose Yoro considering his potential.",

Yoro picked up a foot injury during the defeat to West Ham at the weekend and while he will not make the trip to Stamford Bridge on Friday, Amorim has suggested it is too soon to say whether he will fly to the Basque Country."

      "Following the disappointing draw, which saw Nuno Espirito Santo's side fall further behind in the Champions League race, club owner Evangelos Marinakis entered the pitch to speak with the Portuguese manager.",
      "This action drew criticism from pundits such as Gary Neville and sparked allegations of a subsequent outburst by Marinakis in the tunnel.",
      "\"Scandalous from that Forest owner,\" Neville posted on X. \"Nuno should go and negotiate his exit tonight with him! The Forest fans, players and manager do not deserve that.\"",
      "However, Forest vehemently deny these claims, labelling them as 'fake news', and have called on 'public figures' to avoid 'rushing to judgement'.",
      "In a statement posted on their website, the club said: \"Nottingham Forest can confirm that Taiwo Awoniyi is recovering well so far following urgent surgery on a serious abdominal injury sustained during Sunday’s match against Leicester City.",
      "\"The seriousness of his injury is a powerful reminder of the physical risks in the game, and why a player’s health and well-being must always come first. At Nottingham Forest, this principle is not just policy for us; it is the deeply held belief and conviction of our owner. To Evangelos Marinakis, this isn’t just a football club — it’s family – and he instils that message in all of us.",
      "\"That is why he was so personally and emotionally invested in the situation that unfolded at the City Ground on Sunday. His reaction was one of deep care, responsibility, and emotional investment in one of our own. He didn’t just see it as an isolated incident, but as something that reflected the values and unity of the entire team.",
      "\"In moments like that he demonstrates his leadership, not just through words, but through action and presence. In the final ten minutes of the game, when he saw our player clearly in discomfort, struggling through visible pain, it became increasingly difficult for him to stay on the sidelines. His deep frustration at seeing our player lying on the ground in severe pain -something no one with genuine care could ignore - triggered him to go onto the pitch. It was instinctive, human, and a reflection of just how much this team and its people mean to him. He would do the same again if such an unfortunate event were ever to reoccur.",
      "\"The truth of the matter is there was no confrontation, with Nuno or with others, either on the pitch or inside the stadium. There was only shared frustration between all of us that the medical team should never have allowed the player to continue.",
      "\"In light of this, we urge former coaches and players, and other public figures in the game, to resist the urge to rush to judgement and fake news online, especially when they do not have the full facts and context. Baseless and ill-informed outrage for the purposes of personal social media traction serves no one — least of all the injured player. We call on these influential voices to show the same respect for player welfare that they often demand from others. Let concern come before commentary.",
      "\"At Nottingham Forest, we believe the mental and physical well-being of our players and coaching staff must always take precedence — over media narratives, inflammatory judgements, and certainly over self-promotion. In moments like these, the game must unite around those who put their bodies and minds on the line every week. That’s what real leadership looks like in our game.\"",
      "On Wednesday morning, The Guardian reported that the striker is expected to be brought out of an induced coma later that day following emergency surgery for a severe abdominal injury."

      "There was a groundswell of support for Ratcliffe to take over the club when it at first seemed like he would be completing a full takeover from the Glazers. However, when it became clear that the Glazers would be remaining and Ratcliffe would be looking to complete a minority purchase, opinion soon shifted.",
      "Sheikh Jassim was the only candidate looking to complete a full takeover and with the Glazers unwilling to relinquish power entirely, Ratcliffe was able to shake on a deal. Having taken over the sporting element of the club, Ineos have become a controversial group among supporters.",
      "The decision to rehome approximately 500 season ticket holders for next season sparked protests while their cost-cutting measures stoked fury among some sections of the fanbase. This has raised its head again after Ruben Amorim was forced to step in to allow staff members and their families the chance to go to the Europa League final in Bilbao after Ineos were planning not to fund their travel.",
      "There have also been reports that there will not be an open-top bus parade if United beat Tottenham Hotspur in the final and that celebrations for the squad will be modest with a BBQ planned at Carrington, according to the BBC. Unsurprisingly, this has led some fans to hope for Sheikh Jassim to come in again and try to purchase the club but his mind, at present, seems set.",
      "Not too long after Ratcliffe completed his purchase of a stake in United, Sheikh Jassim dissolved Nine Two UK Holdings Ltd in confirmation that his United dream was over at the time. The company, which listed both Sheikh Jassim and Abdulrahman Al-Ansari as company directors, was set up to take over United.",
      "The name was chosen due to the link to the Class of '92 but once it became clear that the takeover race was run, the company was dissolved as there was no purpose left for it. If Sheikh Jassim was to relaunch a bid for United, his first step would be to reopen Nine Two UK Holdings Ltd but until that point, his involvement in the club remains unlikely."

      "Manchester United and the remainder of the Premier League were put on notice on Wednesday as Xavi Simons' future at RB Leipzig appeared to be confirmed.",
      "The Dutchman only arrived at RB Leipzig permanently in the January transfer window having spent the past 18 months in Germany with the Red Bull club on loan. However, after results last weekend ensured that Leipzig would not be in the Champions League next season, Simons has moved quickly to set his stall out.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that Simons is looking to start a new chapter away from Leipzig and that the club were aware of his decision. On Monday, Sky Sport Deutschland explained that having bought the midfielder for approximately £42m, Leipzig would be looking to secure £67m with his driving force being to play for a club that is in the Champions League.",
      "Romano has added that a host of top Premier League clubs are looking at Simons and United have been linked in the past. United still need more players who can play in the 3-4-2-1 system that Ruben Amorim prefers and the 22-year-old would fit that bill as an attacking midfielder.",
      "First, they would need to secure Champions League football by beating Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final but once that objective is satisfied, United have a secret weapon that could intrigue Leipzig - Jadon Sancho. In England, specifically the Premier League, Sancho's stock is low with his loan spell at Chelsea having not turned many heads.",
      "Perhaps even more concerning for United is that the Blues are reportedly open to paying a £5m penalty to avoid signing Sancho permanently in the summer. If they decide to do that, Amorim will lose a big chunk of what was thought to be guaranteed money for his summer rebuild.",
      "They would also be lumbered with a player who has low stock however there is still a market where Sancho is seen as a valuable asset. In both his stints in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, the winger has impressed and The Sun reported this weekend that Champions League qualified Bayer Leverkusen are watching the forward.",
      "With such a good track record in the Bundesliga, you would imagine that Leipzig would entertain signing Sancho if he was on the table for them. United would avoid a swap deal plus cash for Simons due to its negative impact on PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules).",
      "However, they could be more than happy to negotiate two separate deals which would solve multiple problems for both teams. Of course, this secret weapon only works if Chelsea back out of the deal for Sancho but, at this stage, this scenario would be ideal for everyone involved."

      "Despite all that has happened, United could still finish the season only slightly worse in terms of sporting achievement if they win the Europa League. They go into the final as slight favourites thanks to their history compared to Tottenham Hotspur and United have also shown they are a different beast in the Europa League.",

      "Good news\nDelighted to see that Reading have been taken over by a guy that seems, at least from the outside, interested in running a football club and that club being good at football. No community should go through losing a club, and it seemed all too possible.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe is like Gordon Gekko\nSo Lee wrote in to support Ratcliffe. Just to be clear it’s a different Lee because this Lee would only ever be caught saying Chuck Feeney is a decent billionaire (Google him, it’s a good story ) the rest are just self serving vultures.",
      "There’s a couple of things I’d like to challenge in Lee’s mail",
      "1. We don’t know if Ratcliffe will turn the club around?",
      "2. He’s a self-made billionaire",
      "Answering question 2 will actually answer question 1 so we’ll start there.",
      "There is no such thing as a self made billionaire. Every billionaire starts from a position of middle-class safety in which they have a family which funds their living costs while they build their dream, Jobs, Gates, Musk, all had it. Ratcliffe had two working class parents who had become middle class thanks to their work which gave Ratcliffe the middle class base he needed.",
      "He also got his start in petrochemicals after convincing Esso to pay for his MBA, so that’s three different people who have helped him already but like I said there is no such thing as a self made billionaire.",
      "But this doesn’t mean a billionaire doesn’t work hard, most work long hours and rarely take holidays. So did Jim. But Jim didn’t get where he is by being a brilliant engineer and inventing something amazing or even being a chemical engineer and inventing something. His wealth comes almost entirely from raising private capital which he would then use to buy struggling companies, asset stripping them and moving their headquarters to tax havens.",
      "His chemical businesses in Middlesbrough also regularly just ignore environmental warnings about air and water pollution so if the air and water is terrible – his company is a big reason why.",
      "But his general MO in every case is as follows – identify struggling business with assets which can be sold. Buy very cheap. Immediately cut staff, sell assets, change HQ to tax haven and then pocket the money while publicly claiming the business is struggling and needs to cut costs.\nSound familiar?",
      "Jim is a proud Manc and English man. So proud that he campaigned for Brexit to give Britain back to the British and then once the vote had been taken immediately moved his personal residence to Monaco so he didn’t have to pay UK taxes and support UK services and economy.",
      "Jim is not Lou Gertsner or Warren Buffet who invest in businesses to make them succeed. He’s closer to Gordon Gekko, a vulture capitalist who bends rules (or ignores them) to benefit himself while putting thousands of people out of work.",
      "Will he turn around United? Why don’t we ask the fans of OGC Nice – the other team Ratcliffe owns…",
      "He bought Nice for 100m when they were struggling financially, he immediately came in promising greatness while making massive cuts to staff. Managers last on average 14 months before being fired.",
      "In the six years before Ratcliffe bought the club nice finished in the top 4 three times. Since he bought it? 0 times. At first fans liked Jim as they saw him attending games regularly, this changed within two years especially when Jim was caught saying ‘Nice games just aren’t very interesting to him’.",
      "Today the Nice supporters often protest Jim’s ownership stating he promised a lot and never delivered anything but constant change and chaos.",
      "So my guess….is Jim probably won’t save United. But he will be en excellent bullet shield for the Glazers for a few years.\nLee (the LFC one)",
      "",
      "BBQ fine though\nIt’s simple, United don’t do parades for anything but Premier League and Champions League. Haven’t had a parade since Fergie’s last season.",
      "Kind of of a ‘nothing to see here’ situation this BBQ thing but alas that wouldn’t be clickbaity or allow for DISGRACE and EMBARRASMENT would it.",
      "In fact, United have NEVER held a parade for anything other than the Prem or Champions League… even in Fergie time…. MADNESS",
      "PATHETIC attempt at journalism lol…. AGAIN\nMoses",
      "READ: Why Manchester United must sack Amorim, sell Fernandes, appoint Moyes and raid French side",
      "",
      "Glazers have done a fine job\nHow can you say that the Glazers mismanaged their ownership of Man United? In over 20 years, with minimal input by themselves, they have made hundreds of millions of pounds in personal profit. That seems like brilliant management to me. They even managed to sell a debt ridden business with run down assets for more than they paid for it. Again astounding business.",
      "Hell, the shambles that is the football part of the business even managed to win a trophy every couple years. They can take pride in having won more in the last 20 years than the owners of all but 3 clubs in England (assuming City, ‘pool and Chelsea have actually won more).",
      "How dare you say the Glazers, who bought so much footballing pleasure to the ABU crowd over the last 2 decades are guilty of poor management. After all there are many more ABU’s than MU supporters. By any measure personal to the Glazers they have done a brilliant job of managing the club.\nMurray (life long member of the Anyone But United crowd who was saddened when the Glazers left)",
      "(Erm, they haven’t left; they still own more than 70% of the club – Ed)",
      "",
      "Pashun and wages\nFirstly, some people seem to have issues with Liverpool fans proclaiming themselves as special, or the best in the world, while also booing Trent. Whilst I’m not a fan of booing, it’s probably fair to say that far from being mutually exclusive, they probably go hand in hand.",
      "Typically, fans leave an impression not for their chat about ecumenical matters in the pre-Columbine era, but more for making a massive racket in the stadium and knowing a lot about their players. This might also be called passion and knowledge. It’s therefore no surprise when the outliers do then act like jilted lovers when a player leaves.",
      "On another matter, people often redefine their league failures by quoting where they are in the wages league table. Obviously some clubs pay more than others (I’m looking at the republic of Mancunia), but in the main, professional contracts at elite clubs can give up to 100% extra on top of base salary for hitting performance targets, so is that really any justification? It all sounds a bit chicken and egg to me. Or am I missing something?",
      "To put that sentiment more succinctly, Arsenal will be low wage payers this season because they underachieved in most metrics.\nAdam, LFC",
      "",
      "Trent and ‘family’\nFirst things first, I’m an Arsenal fan so I’m more than likely obnoxious. Just gonna say that up front so all the fans of other clubs can decide whether my opinion is worthy of reading. And yes it is about Trent.",
      "Obviously the Liverpool fans booing a man who has played an important role in winning them everything are stupid, classless, ungrateful, all that. And I also understand that fans are allowed to be stupid and classless. It’s not illegal, it doesn’t necessarily point to a problem with anybody’s character. It’s sport.",
      "You’re not a worse person for booing Trent Alexander-Arnold or for being bitter toward him. But you are stupid, classless, and ungrateful. And you probably don’t have anything in your life worth celebrating if you can’t even celebrate this wonderful footballer, and I mean that sincerely.",
      "What disturbs me about the whole thing is the justification that “he’s one of our own so it hurts more.” That if he’s part of the Liverpool “family” then it makes it even more of a betrayal. Honestly I have to wonder how you treat members of your own family if that’s how you think about it. You should want your family to leave home and spend time experiencing the world. Just because of where he’s born he has to compromise his career to make his family happy? “But we didn’t even get a fee!” Let the man have a life.",
      "I have to wonder how players like Van Dijk and Salah must feel when they see how some of these fans react to “one of our own” leaving his hometown to start a new chapter of his life. Some (often abusive) people are far more horrible to their families than the people they work with and see outside the home, so I have to wonder exactly what kind of person has this sentiment.",
      "Again, you can feel however you want. You’re not better or worse than anyone else for booing your own player (the best right back in the history of the Premier League besides Lauren of course). If you want to allow a thug and a bully like Jamie Carragher to dictate how you feel then be my guest. I’m sure plenty of people will be able to point to other clubs who have booed their own players, been horrible, etc. But I’m not talking about them.",
      "What we saw on Sunday was needlessly small and petty behavior directed toward a club legend, and I don’t think players forget things like that. You’ll never walk alone until you do.\nDeadbeat Cat Dad",
      "",
      "Ronaldo Jnr?\nAm I the only person who finds it completely mental that Cristiano Ronaldo has a 15 year old son playing for Portugal’s U15s? I guess Ronaldo still seems to be 25 in my head.",
      "No idea if the kid is good enough to make it to the men’s team, but it would be one to watch if they both played in the same match (would Sr lose his shit and dock his pocket money if Jr didn’t pass to him?)",
      "Has there ever been a father/son combo in an international match before?\nPhil, Manchester",
      "",
      "FA are actually blameless\nFurther from Paul’s mail earlier about officials not flagging offside at the time they see them, and how this could have prevented the nasty injury suffered by Awoniyi.",
      "I totally agree that the current rules/guidance isn’t necessarily correct but it had to be changed to accommodate VAR.",
      "What I don’t agree with is Paul blaming the FA. They don’t decide the rules which officials follow – it’s IFAB who do this.\nA, LFC, Montreal (stuck up for VAR recently, now the FA – something must be up with me!)",
      "",
      "Beckett is an Evertonian\nI just want to respond to Mick T, Liverpool from his comment on Evertonians and relegation. When I lived in Liverpool, I actually became good friends with a bunch of Evertonians (massive Liverpool fan here) and found them 20+ years ago to be better with the banter (Rafael Beneath Us) and all that. But I always looked at Everton as a kind of second team in my books…happy to support them 36 out of 38 games during the season, etc. But there has been a real shift in them (I blame Jordan Pickford), and they are a supremely bitter club…but also delusional (We won 2-2 at Goodison Park).",
      "And so, let Everton wish for relegation before Liverpool wins a title. I wish Everton a perpetual life of 17th place finishes, staying up on the last day forever, never getting relegated, but always that fear. A sporting equivalent of Waiting for Godot.\nJonathan, Toronto",
      "According to reports, Manchester United staff are ‘dreading even more savage cuts’ if Ruben Amorim’s side lose to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Arsenal are seemingly ‘lucky’ that they play in the Premier League and not in Portugal while Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a victim of Man Utd.",
      "Richard Keys has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has ‘ripped the heart out’ of Manchester United, who are now an ’embarrassing’ side that Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to be part ...",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has set a bold target for Man Utd next season after Ruben Amorim admitted he was “embarrassed” by the club’s performance this season."

      "Manchester United might need to sack Ruben Amorim, sell Bruno Fernandes, replace Andre Onana and induce a global pandemic to meet their targets next season.",
      "Despite slugging it out with Europa League final opponents Spurs to see who can embarrass themselves the most domestically, 16th-placed Manchester United have set themselves the objective of a top-six finish in 2025/26.",
      "Every Premier League club has been set a target for next season but that seems like one of the more outlandish examples.",
      "Only five times in the history of 20-team Premier League campaigns has a side improved their league position by 10 places from one season to the next. Nottingham Forest will make that a half-dozen soon enough, but what lessons can Manchester United take from the past?",
      "",
      "Aston Villa (from 16th in 2002/03 to 6th in 2003/04) – changed managers\n“I had another year left on my contract and I was under no pressure to resign as Aston Villa manager,” said Graham Taylor. “But I have become increasingly unhappy at how the club as a whole was run,” he added, never naming infamous chairman Doug Ellis but leaving little doubt as to his reasoning either.",
      "Having broken his managerial retirement after nine months at the beck and call of a panicking Villa in February 2002, Taylor should perhaps have consulted predecessor John Gregory about the business practises of his new boss.",
      "But Taylor was lured back to the West Midlands in what he would later state he always knew was a “transitional” role. A record of 19 wins from 60 games saw Villa lurch from 8th one season to 16th in his first and only full campaign, before a jump back up to 6th under his replacement.",
      "David O’Leary had been out of work for a year after leaving trophyless Leeds, but an exciting crop of Villa academy graduates dovetailed wonderfully with the experience of Dion Dublin, Ronny Johnsen, Nolberto Solano and Juan Pablo Angel to turn relegation battlers into European qualification contenders.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Make Ruben Amorim quit; he genuinely doesn’t seem far off anyway.",
      "",
      "Everton (from 17th in 2003/04 to 4th in 2004/05) – sold best player\n“I sold Wayne Rooney and Everton got better,” was how David Moyes allayed any concerns West Ham might have had over losing prized asset Declan Rice. And frankly it was powerful logic: they avoided relegation by six points with him as their top scorer, Manchester United handed £27m over after Euro 2004 and Everton used those funds to help qualify for the Champions League.",
      "It does skip past a few key points, like the signing of Tim Cahill, the partnership between David Weir and Alan Stubbs and the form of Lee Carsley. But fundamentally Everton improved as a team when they cashed in on their star player.",
      "Only Norwich (3rd in 1992/93) have ever finished higher in the Premier League with a negative goal difference than the Toffees, who scored the same number of goals when finishing 4th as they did to come 17th, while only actually suffering four fewer defeats.",
      "Even when they chucked their new-found transfer weight around it backfired, but without Rooney at least Thomas Gravesen could finally spread his wings.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Sell Bruno Fernandes, and maybe sign Marcus Bent.",
      "",
      "Fulham (from 17th in 2007/08 to 7th in 2008/09) – signed competent keeper\nIt remains one of the more unlikely relegation escapes in Premier League history, perhaps a little lost in the mire of Derby selfishly and simultaneously recording their Apocalypse Season.",
      "Fulham were already 18th and in trouble when they appointed Roy Hodgson as Lawrie Sanchez’s successor in December 2007. But their struggle to build any momentum left them in this spot heading into the final straight:",
      "The Cottagers then trailed Manchester City 2-0 within 21 minutes of the first of those three must-win games. Yet they did precisely that, Diomansy Kamara capping a ludicrous comeback in stoppage time at the Etihad before Birmingham and Portsmouth were felled for no apparent reason.",
      "Fulham’s eagerness to avoid a similar scenario meant a substantial summer spend, with Andy Johnson, Bobby Zamora, John Paintsil and Zoltan Gera among those signed. But it was free agent Mark Schwarzer, released by Middlesbrough, who rejected Juventus and Bayern Munich to move to west London.",
      "Perhaps a full pre-season of Hodgson’s double training sessions of two banks of four was actually the decisive factor but Fulham went from conceding 60 goals in 2007/08 to letting in only 34 in 2008/09, fewer than Arsenal and indeed every team bar the top three, with Schwarzer equalling a record for most clean sheets in a Premier League season for the Cottagers which still stands.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? It’s not great news for Andre Onana.",
      "",
      "Leicester (from 14th in 2014/15 to 1st in 2015/16) – changed managers but also signed probably the league’s best player from France’s mid-table\nThere is little point in trying to dilute and replicate any element of Leicester’s title-winning season, but also Manchester United should probably sack Amorim after his son is embroiled in a racist sex tape scandal before appointing a likeable but ill-suited manager, being widely tipped for relegation and capitalising on the collective bed-soiling of the usual contenders.",
      "It might also be an idea to identify one of the most effective players in Premier League history, going entirely unnoticed in Ligue Un at a ludicrously low price. Leicester, unbeknownst to everyone including themselves, already had most of the pieces in place to win the title, but N’Golo Kante, a £5.6m signing from Caen, made director of football Steve Walsh perhaps the sport’s most coveted man.",
      "Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas? And does Nigel Pearson calling a journalist an ostrich trigger a series of events which culminates in Andrea Bocelli belting out Nessun Dorma at a disbelieving King Power Stadium?",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Appoint Claudio Ranieri and raid Toulouse.",
      "",
      "West Ham (from 16th in 2019/20 to 6th in 2020/21) – stopped playing in front of fans\nWhile the instinct is to wipe the entire sorry saga from memory, those months in which Jesse Lingard and Tomas Soucek were the single greatest footballers on earth were at least a novelty. A great many things would not have happened without lockdown and West Ham almost qualifying for the Champions League is chief among them.",
      "From the date of the first game without fans in June 2020 to May 2021, when heavy restrictions were still placed on attendance, only five teams accrued more points than West Ham, who trailed Arsenal on goal difference alone.",
      "Considering their plight beforehand it was a ludicrous turnaround. Moyes was again the architect of a huge leap in places but he struggled after replacing Manuel Pellegrini and things only started to click when Michail Antonio was free to chase long balls and run the channels without fear of being chastised by supporters.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Be managed by David Moyes and break into some labs in Wuhan.",
      "READ NEXT: Who each Premier League club should support in the Europa banter and other three finals and why",

      "Reports suggest Leipzig want a quick and sizeable return on their January investment, with the Bundesliga side expected to demand around €80 million (£67m).",

      "The Netherlands international has nine goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga this season, despite Leipzig enduring an up-and-down campaign.",
      "Last term, he registered 25 goal contributions across all competitions and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.",
      "Speaking recently, Simons hinted at his future, telling Sky Germany: “I’m still a young player, I have many dreams and the club knows that. But right now, the most important thing for me is to play well in the upcoming games. Then we have the international matches, and after that we’ll sit down and see what happens.”",
      "Simons’ desire to play Champions League football is thought to be a key factor in his decision. Leipzig are currently seventh in the Bundesliga, with their hopes of qualifying for next season’s competition all but over.",
      "That could give the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool the edge. Man Utd are also interested, but their financial flexibility may depend on Europa League success and the Champions League qualification that comes with it, as revealed by Duncan Castles recently.",
      "He said: “Their problem is an obvious one in that they don’t have much money to play with, certainly not the kind of money that Leipzig are looking at as a sell fee.",

      "According to Romano, the Bavarian giants have submitted a full proposal for Tah, including a complete salary package, and have now received internal approval to press ahead.",
      "The only thing left, Romano said on X, is a green light from the player himself.",
      "“Bayern formal proposal to Jonathan Tah has been approved internally at the club, salary included,” Romano confirmed.",
      "“Green light needed from the player in order to close the deal and get it done, as final crucial step. Up to Jonathan Tah.”",

      "But we’re not sure pointing out that United’s own biggest Premier League leap is a mere three places ‘from seventh to fourth’ is all that relevant. The fact they’ve never finished below eighth is kind of the point.",
      "When you look at the club’s entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved.",
      "Yes, but it also needed the non-brilliance of finishing 11th or lower the year before. United haven’t even had the opportunity for a 10-place jump since the final few years before football history officially began – and going from 13th in 1990 to sixth in 1991 feels at least vaguely adjacent to this latest supposed mission.",
      "In all, since those far-off days of 1964, United have had a whopping five whole seasons where a 10-place top-flight finishing position jump was even possible, and in three of those only winning the league could have achieved it. And in one of those they did go from 11th to second, between 1987 and 1988.",

You just told us.",

      "Right, okay, fine. But where’s the snub? He’s going to Real Madrid. That is, if anything, the opposite of a snub.",
      "Of course, we do here have the now-standard tabloid use of the word ‘as’ where instead of the usual dictionary meaning of ‘something that happens during the time when something else is taking place’ it in fact means ‘something that happens at literally any time other than the time when something else is taking place’.",
      "Last season, in this specific example, when Xabi Alonso was busy winning the Bundesliga and pointedly not preparing to take over at Real Madrid or anywhere else. It was quite significant news at the time.",
      "Yet still we get no nearer to this Real Madrid snub. Until, far later, when we eventually get this.",
      "Ironically, Klopp might have actually talked himself out of contention for the Real Madrid job, with the Spanish side eventually moving for Alonso. It had long been reported that the former Liverpool boss was among their favoured candidates for the role.",
      "So the snub is Real Madrid not giving the job to Jurgen Klopp, a man who expressed no interest in the job and who made it very clear when leaving Liverpool that he would not be returning to a frontline managerial job for some time and quite possibly ever? What a snub. What volumes spoken. What absolute bollocks.",

With the current coefficients, that would mean EPL Vs Serie A, La Liga Vs Bundesliga, Ligue 1 vs Eredivisie and so on. Then you could award loads of coefficient points for the competition so leagues that do well tend to play higher-ranked leagues the next season.",

      "– How to fit it in the calendar? Cut back the formats of the other European club competitions to reduce typical fixture load by about two per team. Those competitions have too many games anyway, and this would attract more TV money, because interest would be broader.

In fact, it’s not just the top teams in the EPL, like City and Liverpool, but also those almost all the way down the EPL table.",
      "Currently, we are seeing almost every star player being linked with a move to the EPL. Granted, this can be as much about an agent seeking exposure to enhance negotiations or a reporter aiming for clicks, but the EPL has consistently acquired many Bundesliga players over the last few years.

That is, frankly, a wild challenge for a team who were two places outside that last season, never mind this catastrophe of a campaign, and have all manner of other teams to try and get past beyond the decaying remains of the old Big Six. Possibly while also having to juggle Champions League commitments for which they are profoundly ill-equipped at this time.",

We are not remotely convinced at this time that such a manager is or can be Enzo Maresca, but we don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask that by this time next year there is some kind of reason to believe that whoever is in fact the manager might be worth sticking with.

Can Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah go again or will the years start to catch up with them? And who picks up the slack then? And we’ve not even started on TAA.",
      "There will, obviously, be more comings and goings this summer than last and while it isn’t necessarily as straightforward as Liverpool MUST defend their title to prove they are here to stay, they absolutely do need to be right in there and involved to the end to convince us this is the start of a Liverpool dynasty and not just one stunning season.",
      "Manchester City: Title challenge\nWeird for City’s target not to just be as straightforward as winning the league, but it does feel like they might need to walk, or at least jog, before they can run here.",
      "City being City and Pep being Pep, it still wouldn’t entirely surprise us to see them 12 points clear this time next year, but right now it would be enough just to see them in genuine contention again and with Guardiola looking willing and able to build another great team.",

      "Manchester United: Top six\nNot what we’d have gone for, because there currently appear to be – at a rough estimate – 15 teams better placed to achieve this but it is apparently the target United’s brains trust has set Ruben Amorim and his merry band of dafties, so there it is. No point us making up our own target when the actual club has already set one.",

      "For the short term next season, it seems reasonable to suggest that maintaining their position among the upper echelons of the Premier League would suffice as long as it’s accompanied by making a better go of the Champions League itself.",
      "Newcastle were, in truth, a touch unlucky on their last go at it a couple of years back as events and circumstance transpired against them. They were always competitive in a tough group, but they did still finish bottom of it.",

      "Nottingham Forest: Don’t be one-season wonders, make decent stab at whichever lesser European comp they’re in\nAmong the more interesting teams next season, because what happens next has such a wide range of possibilities. Has this season been a bit of a rogue one? One in which the sheer scale of the fallibility pretty much everywhere outside Anfield – and Forest won there anyway – has serendipitously combined with Forest’s xG-baiting, p*ss-boiling counter-attacking game?",
      "Or have they actually cracked a code that will allow them to compete at the top end for multiple seasons? We don’t need to see another genuine tilt at Champions League qualification, necessarily; just enough to confirm this season hasn’t been, to be unnecessarily harsh about it, a fluke.",
      "Comfortably top half would be enough for that, while Forest also have the chance to turn (likely) Champions League disappointment this season into something more positive next season. This season has starkly shown the gulf that exists between those European competitions and the potential for even the very daftest of English clubs to have their fun in the lesser ones.",

      "Tottenham: Restore sanity\nOnly Spurs. Only Spurs could have such two obvious ambitions as ‘win trophy’ and ‘qualify for Champions League’ and find themselves one win – against a team they’ve already beaten three times this season – away from achieving both and yet also find themselves entirely mired in mortifying existential crisis.",
      "Even at Man United, an even bigger and at this time even stupider football club, the sense of crisis is not so all-pervading. The Europa League final feels far less like a pivotal sliding doors moment for them than it does for Spurs.",
      "United don’t have the same desperate, yearning hunger for a trophy – they win them all the time regardless of how sh*t they happen to be at any given moment. And they are still Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. They’ll still attract players, they’ll still have the chance to build what they want to build under Ruben Amorim, even if losing the final mires it in greater early uncertainty.",
      "Spurs are completely f*cked if they don’t win the final, and might be quite f*cked even if they do. Even if they do win it, they probably need to thank Ange Postecoglou profusely for delivering on his second-season-trophy promise in the most absurd manner imaginable and move on.",

      "Appointing Graham Potter when they did was both a shrewd move, one that reflected a reality in which the trajectories of both parties had pulled them into each other’s orbit at an opportune moment where it didn’t look like an embarrassing option for either, yet also one that conceded the current season was being written off.",
      "That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The Julen Lopetegui idea had proved a bad one, and there was no point persisting with someone serving up Moyes-lite dullness with no obvious way out of the doldrums.",
      "Potter has not necessarily improved results or performances, but he does offer at least the prospect of better and above all more watchable things to come.",
      "When we think of Good Potter, of Brighton Potter, we think of a meticulous manager with carefully crafted and well-drilled plans. He is a manager who absolutely needs a pre-season. And if anything is left of that Potter, and we really think he’s still in there, then it is only when next season is firmly under way that we can even begin to assess where he and West Ham are at.",
      "The vital thing to do at the start of the season, though, is to avoid offering any encouragement at all to those promoted clubs looking for someone they might be able to drag into a fight. There are few contenders for that role, and West Ham shouldn’t really be one either, but circumstance places them as one of the few for whom a noticeably poor start would offer genuine succour to the newbies.",

      "Wolves: Start properly, don’t require managerial change by November\nWolves have a recent habit of allowing the sloppy end to one season to bleed into a difficult start to the next, often accompanied by rushed or half-baked managerial change.",
      "They lost four of their last six games in 2020/21, and then four of the first five in 2021/22. That season ended with a seven-match winless run, followed by one win in the first nine of 2022/23.",
      "The 2022/23 season then ended with four defeats in their last seven games, and one win in six started the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "That season ended with seven defeats in the last 10, mirrored by seven defeats (and no wins) in the first 10 games of this season.",
      "The fact Wolves have pretty comfortably remained a Premier League club throughout all that tells you that in the middle part they’re generally doing fine.",
      "But these stumbling finishes and slow starts feel like an unnecessary frustration.",
      "It did look like they might be about to buck the trend this time with a six-game winning run through March and April raising genuine hopes of approaching the summer with momentum and optimism.",
      "May, though, has brought a pair of defeats and with games against Palace and Brentford to come there is no guarantee Wolves do snap back out of it before the summer. And as with West Ham above, and Wolves’ own early struggles this season, it would appear a particularly bad time to be offering early hope to newcomers.",
      "Wolves also have a fine manager on their hands; it would be deeply careless should a continuing trend for slow starts leave them feeling the pressure to switch to a tried-and-tested firefighter by November.",

      "Joan Garcia\nArsenal are leading ‘half of Europe’ in the race to sign a keeper they almost landed last summer. They will be hoping for smoother talks with Espanyol, and perhaps even for them to lose their La Liga relegation battle as a £20.9m release clause would drop to £12.5m.",
      "",
      "Vanja Milinkovic-Savic\nIf Chelsea or Manchester City act on their apparent £16.7m interest in the Torino keeper and brother of Sergej then expect every other Ruben Amorim press conference to be spent explaining why no-one currently at Manchester United should really be blamed for releasing a teenager who couldn’t get a work permit in 2015. He is 6ft 8ins so that’s something.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "",
      "Dean Huijsen\nBournemouth spent £12.8m on a teenaged centre-half whose professional career comprised of 15 appearances for Juventus and Roma last July; within a season they are preparing for a £50m auction on their full Spain international.",
      "",
      "Jeremie Frimpong\nThe homegrown bonus of Manchester City academy product Frimpong is obvious but even without it his brilliance at wing-back for Bayer Leverkusen will convince many that £33.5m is something approaching a steal. Liverpool certainly seem to be of that mind.",
      "",
      "Enzo Boyomo\nIt could depend on which European competition Aston Villa qualify for but they are known admirers of Osasuna centre-half Boyomo, who has been crucial for a side he only joined a year ago. Boyomo stayed at Real Valladolid for just one campaign too before moving to Pamplona; whoever triggers his £21m release clause might expect to keep him for a little longer.",

      "Kevin Lomonaco\n“I really like the Premier League. It’s what I watch the most. I like West Ham,” should raise an absurd number of red flags within the departments of any and all clubs charged with scrutinising the character and even sanity of 23-year-old Lomonaco.

      "Matheus Cunha\nNot two months separated Cunha signing a four-and-a-half year contract extension with an improved release clause of £62.5m, and the Brazilian saying he has “made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things,” before claiming to have been misquoted.

Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",

      "Benjamin Sesko\nThere is some debate as to the exact numbers which would compel Leipzig to countenance the sale of Sesko – £62m is the strongest recent claim – but less doubt about whether his record of 35 goals in 79 appearances in Germany is worth the risk on a 21-year-old.",

      "Leeds United, Burnley and whoever else is unlucky enough to get promoted from the Championship need to get it right this summer, or their 2025/26 Premier League season will be full of misery.",
      "Daniel Farke is going to be a busy man, and exploring the loan market could be a stellar method to improve his squad and ultimately stay up.",
      "Here are 10 Premier League youngsters Leeds (or the clubs around them) should try to sign on loan in the summer transfer window…",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nGod bless Brighton and their world-class recruitment team. Albion players account for 30% of this feature and it could have been a lot higher, ignoring Valentin Barco, Facundo Buonanotte and a couple of others. We start with former wonderkid-turned-disappointment Evan Ferguson.",
      "The Irish striker might think he has bigger fish to fry than newly promoted Leeds United, but we’re not sure. After all, he’s currently warming the bench for West Ham – a team 15th in the Premier League – after struggling to play for Brighton in the first half of 2024/25.",
      "There was talk in January of one of the ‘Big Six’, namely Arsenal, looking at him as an emergency option, but that never came close and he ultimately joined a wildly underperforming team who have been unable to improve under Julen Lopetegui’s replacement, Graham Potter.",
      "Brighton and Ferguson need to work out a way to untap the potential everyone was ranting and raving about in 2022, because his stock is falling dramatically and a player once guaranteed to fetch the Seagulls at least £100million is now worth less than half that amount. Another loan might be ruled out considering how poorly his Hammers spell has gone, but minutes are much more likely at a newly promoted team like Leeds, even if Joel Piroe bagged 19 in the Championship this term.",
      "WIN Europa League final tickets – and support the Red Cross",
      "",
      "Harry Amass (Manchester United)\nManchester United are in no way inclined to hand out favours to Leeds United and Leeds United are probably too proud to go to Old Trafford asking for help. Regardless, we have families to feed and want a Man United player in this list.",
      "There is, as always, logic behind this. Leeds are set to lose Junior Firpo – reportedly to Real Betis – and need to sign at least one left-back in the summer. Getting a promising Premier League youngster on loan is cost-effective, but if the profile is right, also very clever on-the-pitch-wise.",
      "Amass’ integration into the United first team has been far from seamless, even though we were told he’d fit Ruben Amorim’s system to a tee. He’s struggled, and that’s to be expected really, given how dysfunctional and easy to play against this United team is.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is the first-choice left-wing-back and Luke Shaw – also able to play left-centre-back – is likely ahead of Amass in the pecking order, so Amass could do with a year out on loan. Rivalries aside, we honestly think Elland Road would be perfect.",
      "",
      "Julio Enciso (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nEnciso is one of Brighton’s most promising youngsters and he has impressed on loan in a rubbish Ipswich Town team. Fingers cannot be pointed at the young Paraguayan for Ipswich’s relegation this season; he has been one of very few bright spots in a miserable campaign.",
      "He is the sort of player capable of getting you off your seat, whether that be with a 30-yard screamer or a piece of skill, which is one of the fundamentals you want from a young whippersnapper, as well as energy, commitment and effort. Which might all basically be the same thing.",
      "Brighton might be reluctant to send Enciso to a promoted club again considering the last six all went immediately back down without putting up much of a fight, but Leeds feel… different. If there’s a Championship club that stands a chance of staying in the Premier League, it’s them. There isn’t much logic to this other than they’re a big club with a rich history. Yep, it looks like we are relying on aura for a relegation battle. Excellent.",
      "",
      "Marc Guiu (Chelsea)\nThere is no way into the Chelsea team for poor Guiu, who turned down an equally difficult pathway at Barcelona to earn more money in London. Game time has been scarce and almost exclusively only in the league phase of the Europa Conference League, and it would make no sense to stagnate his career and development further by keeping him on the periphery again next season.",
      "He is only 19 and six goals in six European games is a positive sign, especially the first-half hat-trick he scored against… Shamrock Rovers. FFS. And we thought the financial disparity between Chelsea and semi-final opponents Djurgardens was bad.",
      "A hamstring injury has ruled Guiu out since February, but even so, he couldn’t get a kick in the Premier League when fit. Leeds and Burnley should give serious thought to signing the Spanish striker this summer, even if we’re not sure how good he is yet.",
      "",
      "Lewis Miley (Newcastle United)\nThis is ambitious, but not completely out of the question. Newcastle are set to return to the Champions League, barring a complete disaster, and will need a big squad in 2025/26 to ensure lightning doesn’t strike twice and they falter domestically as well as in Europe. That makes keeping Miley more sensible than sending him out on loan to Leeds, but there is still a strong chance it could be a career-defining move for the young Geordie.",
      "For a city obsessed with football, Newcastle doesn’t produce a vast amount of talent and Miley is arguably their best academy graduate this century. Eddie Howe will be very careful with his development and won’t make any rash loan decisions. Leeds will need to ensure they are right for him if by some chance they do target Miley. And if they get him, they’ve got a reyt gem.",
      "",
      "Ibrahim Osman (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nCurrently on loan at Feyenoord in the Eredivisie, Osman cost Brighton £16million last February and was sent to the Netherlands in August. Three goals and three assists in the Dutch top flight is pretty underwhelming, especially in comparison to Yankuba Minteh – who left Newcastle for Brighton last summer after a season at Feyenoord – and his 10 goals and three assists.",
      "Osman doesn’t seem ready to come in and play consistently for the Seagulls and after an average loan abroad, joining a newly promoted Premier League team feels like a natural next step.",
      "Leeds’ attack was devastating in the 2024/25 Championship, scoring 95 goals – a division high by 24. Second? Norwich City down in 13th, obviously. Still, they will need more quality up front, especially if Manor Solomon doesn’t join permanently or extend his loan.",
      "",
      "Luis Guilherme (West Ham)\nSpeaking of which, the Whites could probably do with at least two new forwards. Finding a game-changing addition or their next Raphinha is a big ask, so the low-risk additions of Osman and/or West Ham’s Luis Guilherme could work.",
      "The issue with this one is that no-one really knows if Guilherme is any good. We’re not sure if Graham Potter even knows. The positive thing is that he’s a young Brazilian winger and Brazil have produced loads of world-class ones. Let’s just hope he can get closer to the level of Raphinha and Vinicius Junior than Marquinhos and Kenedy.",
      "",
      "Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)\nFocusing entirely on the forward areas would be naïve and very costly. As touched on already, a new left-back is a priority for Daniel Farke, but adding someone with the versatility of Acheampong would go a long way to providing the depth necessary to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Like most players at Chelsea, the 19-year-old is under contract for the foreseeable, signing an extension until 2029 last December, so the Blues clearly rate him highly, and if they do, there’s a strong chance they give him a loan to spread his wings in 2025/26.",
      "He is capable of playing right and centre-back, and there is not one downside we can think of for Leeds, Chelsea or Acheampong.",
      "",
      "Archie Gray (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThis is extremely unrealistic considering how much football Archie Gray has played this season, but considering it’s Leeds we are talking about, there is a chance… ever so slightly.",
      "The reasons for Spurs not sanctioning the loan exit of Gray are much more compelling than the reasons to do it, if we are not jumping the gun by going plural there.",
      "The 19-year-old used to play for Leeds and is welcome back at Elland Road. Go on, Spurs, make it happen; it could be the perfect way to give Gray some positional stability and ensure his progress is not further hindered.",
      "",
      "Stefan Bajcetic (Liverpool)\nForgotten Liverpool starlet Bajcetic has been on loan at RB Salzburg and Las Palmas this season, reuniting with Pep Lijnders in Austria. Jurgen Klopp’s old assistant manager lasted 29 games and six months before being sacked.",
      "Liverpool snapped up Bajcetic for a measly £224,000 in December 2020, making his first-team debut a little under two years later. After showing immense promise, injuries began to hold him back and a loan was the right call last summer. Still, it’s not been a comfortable year for the 20-year-old, who was recalled in January and instantly sent to Las Palmas in his native Spain.",
      "At least moving to La Liga was the right call. He’s played a lot more in his home country, but his performances haven’t been great. Next year could be make-or-break for Bajcetic, and Leeds signing him would be risky, but the potential reward is huge.",

It would be annoying if the Old Trafford Banter Years swept up yet another trinket to pull further clear of Arsenal’s haul in this renaissance period, but the alternative of Spurs being happy is unthinkable.",

      "Wednesday 14 May 2025 19:27, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has said he is far from quitting as Manchester United boss after warning he could walk away if results do not improve next season.",
      "Amorim was \"embarrassed\" after West Ham came to Old Trafford and won for the first time in nine matches to move above United, whose dreadful Premier League campaign has left them 16th in the table after losing 17 games.",
      "The United boss warned that everyone at the club must \"seriously think about a lot of things\" before saying they should \"give space to other people\" if the poor form continues after the summer.",
      "But Amorim insisted in his press conference ahead of next Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham that he has no plans to step down.",
      "Asked if he would seriously resign, Amorim said: \"I am far from quitting.\"",
      "\"What I am saying is that since I arrived here I am always talking about the standards. I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and not say something and take responsibility,\" he added.",
      "\"I have a clear plan of what to do. I understand the problems of the team.\"",
      "But the United boss, far more upbeat than in the aftermath of the defeat to West Ham, warned \"we need to perform or else they will change us\".",
      "Amorim also confirmed he had agreed to pay for his backroom staff to go to next week's Europa League final after reports claimed the club would not be covering the cost of their tickets.",
      "This is just the latest cost-cutting measure implemented under United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen more than 400 redundancies since taking control of football operations from the Glazer family.",
      "Amorim, who acknowledged it is \"hard to manage things\" at United, said the cut-backs made it difficult for the club to pay for those staff still in a job.",
      "\"We have had a lot of people leaving and a lot of changes in our staff,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"In our club at the moment it is sometimes hard to understand when to take and when to give and to respect the people when we have taken their jobs to survive and rebuild.",
      "\"It is complicated for the club to give to other members of staff, so it is a really hard position.",
      "\"That situation was explained and my reaction was to help because - I am not a good guy - it is not going to change my life. The players had the same reaction.",
      "\"Everybody wants the staff and the families there.\"",
      "Amorim says injured United defenders Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Diogo Dalot are pushing to feature in next week's Europa League final.",
      "Yoro joined fellow centre-backs De Ligt and Heaven on the sidelines after limping off in Sunday's 2-0 loss to West Ham with a foot injury.",
      "The trio were absent from training just a week out from facing Spurs and head coach Amorim said: \"I don't know if they are going to be available.",
      "\"We are going to try to push because it's the final matches and this is a final, you know that. All the players want to play that really bad, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think they will not go to Chelsea [on Friday], but we will have a possibility to have some of them in the final.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are ruled out of the match against Tottenham next Wednesday.",
      "Jonny Evans and Toby Collyer were in training a week out from the final, while full-back Dalot did an individual session before the main group trained as he seeks to make it to Spain.",
      "The 26-year-old has made 51 appearances for United this term in all competitions but last month suffered a potentially season-ending calf injury.",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad,\" Amorim said. \"I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, second injury [follows] and then it's a big thing.",
      "\"We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad, so we will see but he's working really hard to get in the final.\"",
      "\"I am working really hard, you can imagine how much I want to be back as soon as possible,\" he said."

      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",

      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",

      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",

That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim: \"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK'. That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it’s the end of the world to lose a game at home\"",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim insists Man Utd are \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\" after admitting to being “embarrassed” about his side's lack of urgency amid their Premier League struggles.",
      "United returned to earth with a bump three days after reaching the Europa League final as fellow strugglers West Ham secured their first Premier League win at Old Trafford since 2007.",
      "Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored in a 2-0 triumph that meant United have now lost an eye-watering 17 top-flight matches this term, with nine of them coming on home turf.",
      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",
      "\"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',\" the United boss said.",
      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",
      "\"We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "Amorim then appeared to cast doubt over his own role at United he reiterated that United \"need to change a lot of things during the summer\" and acknowledged that could eventually lead to a change in the dugout, having overseen just six league wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Asked how he changes the players' attitude given his struggles to do so, he said: \"I don't know, and I don't want to talk about players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "\"If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "So poor have United been that he even suggested that Champions League qualification may be an issue.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final,\" he said. \"It's by far the smallest problem in our club. We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing that in the end of this season that playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon, so we need to know that.",
      "\"I'm not concerned about the final. They (the players) will be focused and I don't know what is best, if it's playing Champions League or not. So, let's think about Chelsea to improve a lot of things.\"",
      "Man Utd deserve to be in a relegation scrap.",
      "If you take the three relegated clubs out of the equation, Manchester United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games.",
      "They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and top-flight is so great, otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games, they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right-flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals. West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense."

      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",
      "The problems continued to mount up for Man Utd in the second half as Leny Yoro was forced off through injury just 10 days before the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",

You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",
      "\"I am responsible for that. It is frustrating because we are so near the goals. We have such a lack of urgency to protect our goal. This is week by week. We don't play so well in the Europa League but we have a different sense of urgency.",
      "\"It's something we need to work on. It's inside the pitch and outside the pitch. If we are not able to do, we have to go away and give the space to different people. All of us.",

      "United have fallen 1-0 behind 12 times at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season, with only Leicester (15) doing so more at home in the 2024/25 competition, while it's the Red Devils' most ever in a single Premier League campaign, overtaking 11 times in 2023/24.",
      "Man Utd are winless in seven Premier League games (drawn two and lost five), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992.",
      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",
      "But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in to this team in the longer-term.",

      "Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch.",

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.",
      "Surely but surely nobody can argue this is anything but a successful season.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
