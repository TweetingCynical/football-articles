      "Jadon Sancho will love what Marcus Rashford previously said about his own loan spell at Aston Villa, as the Manchester United winger gets set to head there himself. Sancho is now poised to join Villa on a season-long loan, after the out-of-favour star was placed in Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' during pre-season, alongside Tyrell Malacia, Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "For now, Malacia is the only one left at Old Trafford; with Rashford on loan to Barcelona, Garnacho sealing a £40million switch to Chelsea last week, and Sancho on his way to Villa on deadline day.",
      "The 25-year-old will likely call upon his old United and England team-mate for advice about working under Unai Emery. Rashford spent the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan to Villa, and made a real stamp on the team during his limited time.",
      "Upon joining, Rashford admitted how he had \"a few clubs\" approach him, but choosing Villa was \"an easy decision\".",
      "He added: \"I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions. I just want to play football and am excited to get started.\"",
      "The Manchester-born star shone in the Champions League for Villa, while scoring four times across all competitions and making a big difference in Emery's front line.",
      "However, injury eventually hampered his time in the west Midlands and he returned to United for a brief period in the summer, before heading overseas to join Barcelona. When saying his goodbyes to the Villa supporters, Rashford's words could be of some comfort to Sancho as he heads to Birmingham for the season.",
      "Writing on social media at the time, Rashford said: \"Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me. It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from 1st minute on the pitch.",
      "\"Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",
      "Rashford also initially saw his fitness and goalscoring prowess improve while at Villa, as he commented on his confidence returning following the team's 3-0 victory over Preston North End that sent them to the FA Cup semi-finals.",
      "After scoring a brace in that game, the 27-year-old said: \"It's a great feeling, I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. It's obviously nice for a forward to get a goal so hopefully it continues.",
      "\"I think we have to just take it one game at a time and give it 100 percent on the pitch and see where it takes us. We're a very ambitious team – we want to win and try and get as far as we can in all competitions and we also want to push to get back into the top four.\"",
      "Sancho will benefit from hearing Rashford's words ahead of his straight loan move to United's Premier League rivals, given that he struggled for form before Amorim even arrived.",
      "In his 83 appearances for the club since he joined, the winger has scored 12 goals and assisted six times, with his most recent stint in red coming in a penalty shootout defeat to Manchester City in the Community Shield, where he played seven minutes and missed his spot-kick.",
      "Meanwhile, Emi Martinez has been looking at going the other way from Villa to United. But the Red Devils have now reportedly agreed a deal for Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens, which may well push Martinez out of Amorim's plans for the upcoming season – but anything could happen on deadline day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United paid a world-record fee for a teenager when bringing Anthony Martial to Old Trafford on deadline day 2015, but the Red Devils were later able to save some money on the forward. Martial arrived from Monaco for an initial £36million, with the deal potentially rising to £57.6m.",
      "There was hope that Martial could be the prospect to ignite the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, even if United boss Louis van Gaal believed the club had overpaid for the forward. His debut goal against Liverpool, combined with numerous comparisons to Thierry Henry, only added more fuel to the fire.",
      "Martial ended his debut season with 11 league goals, but would only better that tally once before he left the club in 2024. Although he ultimately failed to fulfil his potential at United, the excitement surrounding the Frenchman was summed up by a contract clause dependent on Martial being shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or, which saved United £7.2m.",
      "Martial signing for £36m broke the record fee for a teenager that had been set by his team-mate Luke Shaw's move from Southampton the previous year. However, Monaco included three transfer clauses in the deal, each worth £7.2m, which could have seen the club earn an additional £21.6m.",
      "The first objective to be achieved was Martial scoring 25 league goals by the end of the 2018/19 season. His bright start to life at Old Trafford suggested this would not be a problem, but Martial's subsequent inconsistent form meant the £7.2m was not paid until October 2018.",
      "The second clause rested on the striker earning 25 caps for France. He made his international debut soon after signing for United and featured 30 times for Les Bleus between 2015 and 2021.",
      "United were spared from paying the final £7.2m, though, as Martial was never among the nominees for the Ballon d'Or. He came closest during the 2019/20 campaign, scoring 23 goals in all competitions, but struggled to rediscover that form before leaving the club as a free agent last year. It meant that United paid £50.4m in total for Martial, who scored 90 goals in 317 appearances.",
      "While Martial showed early signs of promise, Van Gaal was honest in his belief that United had been overcharged. A short time after the deal had been finalised, the Dutch coach explained that the forward had been bought more for the next United manager.",
      "\"It was a ridiculous amount of money, but it's the crazy world we are in,\" Van Gaal told executive United season ticket holders in 2015. \"United are routinely quoted £10m more for a player, but I have not bought Martial for me. I have bought him for the next manager of Manchester United.\" He later suggested he would be succeeded by his assistant coach, Ryan Giggs.",
      "However, Van Gaal was replaced by Jose Mourinho in 2016, and Marial began to lose some of his early momentum, with the striker later accusing the manager of disrespect. It wasn't until the arrival of United hero Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that Martial began to remind fans of his potential, though he was unable to sustain his top form beyond a single season.",
      "After Solskjaer left the Red Devils in November 2021, Martial fell out of favour with interim boss Ralf Rangnick. He was loaned out to Sevilla in January, scoring once in 12 appearances. In his two years under Erik ten Hag, Martial scored 11 goals in 48 games.",
      "This was not what Monaco had envisioned when selling the young forward to Old Trafford. He had been expected to meet all of the club's transfer clauses, including being shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "In 2015, Monaco president Vadim Vasilyev announced: \"The price for Martial is £57.6million, but take into account this sum includes bonuses, which are very realistic.\"",
      "United released Martial at the end of his contract last year, ending his nine-year stint at Old Trafford. The 29-year-old later joined Greek side AEK Athens, where he scored nine goals in 23 games across all competitions last season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Aston Villa have agreed a loan deal for Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho. The 25-year-old is set for a switch that will see him spend the remainder of the 2025-26 season at Villa Park.",
      "Sancho had started Monday looking likely to remain at Old Trafford, one of two members of Manchester United's 'Bomb Squad' still banished from the first-team squad at the club's Carrington training ground - the other being Tyrell Malacia. Now Villa, who have been restricted by their need to adhere to UEFA financial regulations during the summer, are pushing to get a deal over the line after a breakthrough with the player's camp.",
      "They have been looking for a wide player to replace Leon Bailey, since his loan move to Roma, and have turned to Sancho who is in the final year of his United contract, although they do have an option to extend. Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, where he made 41 appearances, before they paid United £5m NOT to sign him permanently, having initially agreed a £25m obligation as part of his loan deal.",
      "Sancho currently earns just over £200k-a-week at United, having incurred a 25 percent pay cut due to the club's lack of Champions League football. That is a figure United are keen to get off their books and is one that Villa are more able to take up - they'll pay roughly 80 percent plus a small loan fee -, particularly as United look to take Emi Martinez to be their new No.1.",
      "But they're now back in after members of the club's hierarchy moved to sanction a costly short-term solution with Martinez instead of planning for the future with Royal Antwerp’s highly-coveted young stopper Senne Lammens, whom the club's goalkeeping scout, Tony Coton, has been pushing for.",
      "However, United's top brass feel that signing the former Arsenal keeper is a gamble they have to take, even though the club are flirting with PSR problems having already spent more than £200million on new signings this summer. Martinez was left out of the Villa team by a furious Unai Emery for the 3-0 defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday, with the two sides looking to get a deal done.",
      "If they can't, then the door is still open for Lammens to complete his move.",

      "Erik ten Hag has been sacked by Bayer Leverkusen after just two Bundesliga games in charge. The job in Germany was his first since being dismissed by Manchester United, but it has been short lived.",
      "Ten Hag saw his side lose their opener against Hoffenheim before drawing to Werder Bremen at the weekend and the club's hierarchy have opted for a change. The Dutchman's pre-season had not inspired confidence as the squad came to terms with a number of key departures.",
      "The ex-Ajax boss was looking to rebuild his reputation in Germany but, after winning in the first round of the German Cup, he picked up just one point from a possible six.",
      "Leverkusen surrendered a two-goal lead against ten-man Bremen at the weekend to leave with just a point and, despite having little time to implement his ideas, Ten Hag has been shown the door.",
      "A club statement read: \"Bayer 04 Leverkusen have parted ways with head coach Erik ten Hag. This was decided by the shareholders' committee, the club’s supervisory body, on the recommendation of the management of Bayer 04. Training will be overseen by the current backroom staff on an interim basis.\"",
      "Captain Robert Andrich said after their Bremen collapse: “If we lead 3-1 and are a man up, we must take three points. We were too wild and made many mistakes after the sending-off. We must start playing as a team immediately, otherwise we won’t win any matches.\"",
      "The German club's hierarchy refused to back their manager after their collapse at the weekend, which was seen as a damning sign, and are again looking for a new manager having seen the hugely successful Xabi Alonso leave for Real Madrid in the summer.",
      "Leverkusen have seen the likes of Jeremie Frimpong, Granit Xhaka and Florian Wirtz leave the club this summer, recouping huge fees, but leaving them lacking in quality and Ten Hag ultimately paid the price.",
      "It is another major blow for the ex-United boss, who saw his tenure in Manchester end poorly. He was controversially backed after winning the FA Cup in 2024 but it quickly became apparent that the Ineos bosses needed to make a change and he was sacked in October last year.",
      "Ten Hag also copped criticism for his transfer record, which saw him spend more than £600m on the likes of Antony, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana - only to see them all fail to hit expectation. Several of his signings are already being ushered out of the club.",

Aston Villa goalkeeper Martinez was left out of Unai Emery's squad on Sunday that lost 3-0 to Crystal Palace, with the manager confirming he wasn't \"focused\" on the game due to a possible transfer.",
      "While Ruben Amorim insists he is happy with his options of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, the pace is picking up on the World Cup-winning 'keeper making a last minute move to Manchester. However, Martinez won't be pleased that the Portuguese manager has gotten rid of one of his international teammates, following Garnacho's £40million move to Chelsea.",
      "Back when the young winger made his debut for Argentina in June 2023, the shot-stopper was full of praise for Garnacho's capabilities both on and off the field. Speaking to TyC Sports at the time, he said: \"He is a very humble guy. He came to work; he didn't talk a lot.",
      "\"He is very eager to play. The truth is that he's a little treasure and I hope we can mould him so that he gives us as much as Angel Di Maria.\"",
      "So while Martinez may be saddened by Garnacho's move away from the club he could potentially join in the next few hours, he still has a familiar face in front of him in United's backline. During Argentina's famous World Cup win in 2022, the heroic 'keeper dubbed Lisandro Martinez an \"animal\", as the pair helped their country to their third trophy of its kind - and the first since 1986.",
      "The defender has been out of the United squad with a cruciate knee ligament injury since last season, but is targeting a return to the field after the international break.",

      "Onana has made one appearance for the Red Devils so far this campaign, in the dramatic penalty shootout loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. While the 'keeper did save one spot kick, he failed to keep two goals out of United's net in regular time, and has since been dropped in favour of Bayindir once more.",
      "The Turkish star has started all three of United's Premier League games, but he hasn't instilled confidence with his performances so far. Bayindir has conceded four goals in three matches, including two from a newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday.",

      "Manchester United have finally agreed a deal to sell Antony to Real Betis, with the winger set to return to the club he spend the second half of last season on loan at. Antony joined United from Ajax for an initial £81.3million back in 2022, but has struggled to make much of an impact.",
      "The Brazilian managed just 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances across all competitions and United are now set to cut their losses. Antony has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim and was keen on a return to Betis after finding form during his loan spell.",
      "Now, after the furore of the weekend, a £21.5m deal has been struck after an agreement was reached over Antony's salary. The deal also includes potential add-ons worth around £2.6m and a clause that will see United bank 50 per cent of any profit Betis make by selling Antony. The 25-year-old is set to take a major pay cut, with the winger having two years left on his £6m-a-year deal at Old Trafford.",
      "The deal hit the skids over the weekend due to money owed to the player on the remaining two years of his deal - with both Betis and United not wanting to pay. United did not want to pay Antony any more money and the club have now got their way. They will make no further payment to the player' with Antony having to do his bit to seal his return to Betis.",

      "Unai Emery showed his frustration with Emi Martinez during a bizarre pre-match interview on the eve of transfer deadline day.",
      "Martinez was left out of the Aston Villa squad for their Premier League game against Crystal Palace on Sunday night amid speculation he could leave for Manchester United. The Argentina international has been linked with a transfer all summer and things came to a head on the weekend.",
      "Emery opted to leave Martinez out of the squad entirely, with summer signing Marco Bizot starting in goal. It proved to be an ill-fated decision, with Bizot conceding a penalty for a foul on Daichi Kamada as Palace eased to a 3-0 win at Villa Park.",
      "In awkward scenes, Emery left long pauses as he stuck to his unusual approach. Asked where Martinez was, he replied: \"Marco Bizot!\" Asked whether Bizot would be the Villa goalkeeper going forward, he declined to add anything else, just repeating his name once more before stating \"your time is over\" and walking off.",
      "After the game was over, and Villa had suffered a damaging home defeat, Emery did admit that the situation needed resolving. \"It is not helping us. One of the circumstances not helping,\" he said.",
      "\"We will see how we close the transfer window. We have a lot of circumstances that are not helping us be mentally like we were last year.\"",
      "Asked why Martinez was left out, Emery replied: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent. He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Martinez, United and Villa are in a three-way tussle which also involves Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens. United have been in talks with Antwerp over a deal for their 23-year-old goalkeeper. It was reported on Sunday that United had tabled an improved offer for the player ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline.",
      "But Lammens has also been linked with Villa, who are looking at their options for if Martinez does leave. It is an intriguing situation which has come about largely because of the shaky performances of both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana for United this season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has insisted he is happy with his options in between the posts, but United are pursuing a deadline day deal nonetheless. Villa, meanwhile, have been hamstrung by profit and sustainability rules and have been quiet this summer in the window.",

      "Raheem Sterling swapped one London club for another at the last minute in 2024, allowing Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to escape Old Trafford and head to Chelsea. Last year's deadline day was full of surprises in the Premier League, with Chelsea's dramatic dealings sparking plenty of headlines.",
      "Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal, and United saw Sancho and Sterling move to different parts of London on loan for the new campaign. As the transfer window slammed shut, the Blues released a small statement confirming Sterling's departure, which simply read, \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger - who is now 30 years old and back at Stamford Bridge - completed a last-minute loan switch to the Emirates Stadium. This was after it became clear he was not part of manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club throughout the summer.",
      "Chelsea saw another new addition to their squad: the arrival of former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially was swapped in for Sterling. The England international was also left out of then-boss Erik ten Hag's plans at United and had been free to depart either on loan or on a permanent deal.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the chosen location for the young attacker, as United agreed to an obligation to buy price of £23million if certain targets were met. That was a far cry from the £73.5m that the club paid back in the summer of 2021 to lure Sancho to Manchester, but he hardly pulled up trees at Old Trafford, registering just 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances, subsequently seeing his stock fall dramatically.",
      "Meanwhile, Sterling was reunited with an old friend at Arsenal; boss Mikel Arteta, who spent a lot of time working under Pep Guardiola during the forward's seven-year tenure with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the end of the 2024/25 season regardless of his impact in north London.",
      "During his time at Arsenal, the forward managed just one goal and assisted five times in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League. Sterling was used sparingly and arguably enjoyed his best game when he helped Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice score in a 2-2 draw with PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's elite competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but ultimately finished the season without silverware and barely any game time before heading back to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Meanwhile, Sancho had a more impactful year with Chelsea, scoring five goals and assisting 10 times across 41 appearances both domestically and in Europe. Most of the young winger's goals came in the Premier League, but it was in the knockout stages of the Conference League where he shone the most for the Blues.",
      "After making the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund while on loan in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho made yet another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, and they dispatched the Spanish club in style, winning 4-1 with Sancho scoring the third in the 83rd minute of the game.",
      "However, Chelsea opted not to pay a fee to United to avoid having to trigger Sancho's buyout clause, having failed to be convinced by the winger despite his role in helping them claim silverware.",
      "Now, Sancho is part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still trying to secure a move away for the winger as he is not part of the Portuguese manager's plans for the future.",
      "Sancho has already turned down moves to Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly wanted by several clubs, while Sterling is also unwanted at Chelsea. With both players in difficult positions at their clubs, there's every chance they could one again be involved in a dramatic deadline day move, and will hope this time they can make more of an impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Few signings will ever match the hype and euphoria Cristiano Ronaldo’s return to Manchester United brought on transfer deadline day. In summer 2021, following the exciting new additions of Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho, United appeared set to suffer a blow as club legend Ronaldo looked to make a return to the Premier League.",
      "The then-36-year-old was strongly linked with a move to neighbours Manchester City. But the Red Devils made a last-ditch intervention with Juventus and Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, while club legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Rio Ferdinand phoned the player to dissuade him from joining City.",
      "What followed was a bombshell announcement that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner had apparently made a U-turn to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side – 12 years after he left for Real Madrid and went on to become one of the greatest players of all time. For many fans, it marked the homecoming of their dreams and represented a return to the old Manchester United, which had been lost since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013.",
      "Ronaldo’s sensational return cost an initial £13million, but totalled £38m when factoring in the £385,000-a-week he was paid over the next 64 weeks he spent in Manchester. Despite being a big sum for a player in his mid-30s, it still represented a salary cut on the £500,000-per-week he had received at Juve.",
      "And, simply put, the fans didn’t care as they raced to print the Portuguese icon’s name on the back of their 2021/22 jerseys. The feel-good factor was through the roof. A swashbuckling United led by club legend Solskjaer had finished second the previous season and here they were, adding the most lethal finisher in history to their ranks.",
      "Ronaldo said after his move was announced: “Manchester United is a club that has always had a special place in my heart, and I have been overwhelmed by all the messages I have received since the announcement on Friday.",
      "”I cannot wait to play at Old Trafford in front of a full stadium and see all the fans again. I'm looking forward to joining up with the team after the international games, and I hope we have a very successful season ahead.”",
      "Having initially joined the Old Trafford club in 2003, Ronaldo went from an exciting prospect to a world beater over the next six years, netting more than a century of goals for the Red Devils and contributing to United securing three Premier League crowns, plus the Champions League.",
      "Upon his return, he was given his iconic No. 7 shirt back and scored on his second debut against Newcastle. More goals followed as he registered 24 in all competitions, but his efforts were in vain as United struggled for form and Solskjaer was sacked early on in his first season.",
      "Ronaldo would play under two interim managers that season in Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick as he visibly grew more and more frustrated at the side's fall from grace. Ronaldo reportedly made attempts to engineer a move elsewhere but failed to do so before the transfer window, while United refused to let him go.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s appointment as permanent boss in the summer of 2022 presented a potential fresh start, until it became clear the Dutchman was not giving his veteran forward any preferential treatment. The Portuguese was omitted from the Manchester derby defeat to rivals Manchester City, which became a huge talking point.",
      "Ten Hag claimed he left Ronaldo on the bench \"out of respect\" as United were 4-0 at half-time, though he later asked Ronaldo to come on as a substitute three minutes before the end of the victory over Tottenham, which the striker refused to do.",
      "Ronaldo then stormed down the tunnel and out of Old Trafford before the final whistle – an incident he admitted he regretted. Ten Hag had responded to that tantrum by suspending him for one fixture before making Ronaldo captain for the next four matches.",
      "However, Ronaldo’s mind was already made and, ahead of the 2022 World Cup, he sat down for a tell-all interview with close friend Piers Morgan on Talk TV, where he blasted both Ten Hag and predecessor Rangnick.",
      "The forward said he had been “betrayed” by United, also claiming Ten Hag had tried to force him out of the club. United responded by terminating his contract, paving the way for his move to current club Al-Nassr in January 2023, and bringing one of the club’s biggest and most exciting signings ever's time to a bitter end.",

      "Manchester United could be in line for a busy deadline day this year. A number of exits are on the cards for the Red Devils before the deadline on Monday.",
      "And while some of them could be welcome as Ruben Amorim attempts to guide United back on track, some might not be as accepted as others. That was certainly the case when academy graduate Axel Tuanzebe left the club for Ipswich Town on deadline day in 2023.",
      "The move to Portman Road brought to an end his 17-year association with the Red Devils, having been at the club from the age of eight and progressing through the club’s youth system.",
      "Back in 2015, he won the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award while club icon Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made him the club’s youngest-ever captain in a Carabao Cup tie vs Rochdale in 2019.",
      "Speaking at the time, Solskjaer said. \"Axel is a captain in the making, he's a leader. Why not give it to young kids? How does he handle it? He was fine, he enjoyed it. It's just a way of telling him that we trust him.\"",
      "Solskjaer wasn’t the only one aware of Tuanzebe’s leadership abilities. Harry Maguire was also one of those to note his potential to be leader with the Red Devils.",
      "\"We have a lot of leaders in the dressing room, a lot of senior pros,\" Maguire said. \"And you don’t have to be a senior pro to be a leader. Axel is a leader, in the ways that he works and speaks in the dressing room. And he’s only a young boy, he’s still learning his trade. I’m sure he’ll go on to have an unbelievable career.\"",
      "Tuanzebe left Old Trafford having made 37 appearances for the first team, injuries having hugely disrupted his time with the club. And that appears to have been a sticking point for the defender having lodged a legal complaint against his former side for “medical negligence”.",
      "Meanwhile, United appear to have moved on, with Amorim having put together a leadership group over the summer. He said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys now. They are responsible for the group.",
      "\"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them in this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.",
      "\"We have Bruno, we have Licha (Martinez), we have Harry, we have Diogo (Dalot), we have Tom (Heaton) and we have Nous (Mazraoui). So it's not just the oldest one.",
      "\"Nous is in the group because he's a character that I like. And I try to understand the dynamic of the group. Try to reach every space. They are the guys that are responsible to keep everyone in line.\"",

      "Buckle up, Manchester United fans, it's set to be a busy transfer deadline day. With £207.5million spent on their attack, the Red Devils are focussed on bolstering the other end of the pitch before Monday's 7pm cutoff.",
      "United are looking to finish as fast as they started the summer transfer window, having welcomed Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million move from Wolves all the way back on June 1. Cunha's arrival at Old Trafford was followed up by the addition of Bryan Mbeumo, as after weeks of fraught negotiations with Brentford, the Red Devils stumped up a £71m package to land his signature.",
      "After Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko was signed in a deal which could rise to £74m, completing a new-look forward line for Ruben Amorim. Scoring goals from open play has still been an issue in the early stages of the 2025-26 season but's conceding them which has really harmed United.",
      "The Red Devils are yet to keep a clean sheet and the finger has often been pointed at the man between the posts. That's why Amorim wants to sign at least one new goalkeeper - and to finally offload a hoard of unwanted stars.",
      "Here are seven deals which United are looking to complete before the transfer window shuts.",
      "First up, it's United's most glaring issue: goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir has played every Premier League game so far but hasn't been convincing while Andre Onana's performance at Grimsby was nothing shirt of a disaster.",
      "So, the Red Devils have turned to Senne Lammens. An improved bid was sent to Royal Antwerp on Sunday and United hope to complete the signing of the 23-year-old Belgian, with the deal set to cost upwards of £20million.",
      "As a contingency, though, the Red Devils made fresh contact with Aston Villa to discuss Emiliano Martinez, who's already agreed personal terms. The Argentina international, 32, is much more established than Lammens, who could join Villa his a replacement, but would cost significantly more.",
      "Lammens and Martinez aren't the only goalkeepers in United's sights. Abdulla Al-Hammadi, a former Everton trialist, has been on trial at Old Trafford during the summer, training with the club's academy.",
      "The MEN report that 20-year-old Al-Hammadi, who hails from the UAE, has impressed staff and will be an academy signing. Due to being a free agent, Al-Hammadi doesn't need to be signed before the deadline.",
      "After ex-United star Scott McTominay, Rasmus Hojlund wants to be next player to reignite his career at Napoli. Hojlund, 22, is poised to join the Serie A champions on loan for the season, banking United £5m, before a £38m obligation to buy kicks in next summer.",
      "Another Red Devil who reignited his career away from Old Trafford is Antony - but he's still at United. The 25-year-old Brazilian has been holding out for a return to Real Betis all summer, and just as there looked to be light at the end of the tunnel, the Spanish side withdrew their offer.",
      "After Betis went public, it's now a stalemate. \"There is no agreement for Antony and we have withdrawn the offer,\" the club explained. \"We can't afford the fee and the amounts that Manchester United must instead pay the player before the transfer.\"",
      "Unlike Antony, there's been much less talk surrounding the potential departure of Jadon Sancho. Chelsea opted not to sign the English winger permanently and he's now in the final year of his contract.",
      "Roma have been pursuing Sancho, 25, but he hasn't been swayed as of yet. Late on Sunday, it emerged that the ex-Borussia Dortmund star was a target for Villa, who've endured a wretched start to the season.",
      "Speaking of players in the bomb squad - which included the now departed Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho - Tyrell Malacia is seeking a move. Elche entered talks last week but currently nothing is imminent.",
      "Another left-back, Harry Amass, is also due to leave but on a temporary basis. Amass is expected to complete a season-long loan move to Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Talks over a deal for Lammens have been ongoing but it emerged over the weekend that United had rekindled their interest in Martinez, though they will only sign one.",
      "Martinez, 32, was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the summer. It was reported on Sunday that United have, in fact, now approached their Premier League rivals over a possible transfer, with an agreement on personal terms already in place. At the same time, news of an approach from Villa emerged.",
      "The Telegraph have since outlined that United have returned to the table with a new offer for Lammens, who they claim is the Red Devils' preferred target to come in and compete with Onana and Bayindir.",
      "The 23-year-old is highly regarded in Belgium by both club and country and has also attracted interest from Galatasaray. He is keen on the idea of moving to Old Trafford, though, if a deal can be done in the next 36 hours.",
      "While Lammens is likely to cost in excess of £20million, that is around half of the £40m that Villa would likely demand to part with Martinez. United have spent in excess of £200m on new attackers this summer as they bid to bounce back from their worst ever Premier League campaign last year.",

      "And so, in a desperate bid to ease her disappointment, Eamonn has been lavishing her with a number of luxury treats.",
      "The GB News presenter, 65, organised a special VIP lunch at Fulham football stadium's new £100m stand to watch his team Manchester United. Tickets for the VIP stand allegedly cost up to an estimated £12,000.",
      "Eamonn, who is yet to finalise his divorce from Loose Women panellist Ruth Langsford, was dressed in a blue suit. Meanwhile, Katie was seen wearing a pin-striped outfit.",
      "Two days before, on Friday, Katie and Eamonn jetted off to Belfast for a luxury weekend. And this came after the pair headed to Cyprus last month to enjoy family time with Katie and her three children.",
      "The couple and her children were spotted on a cruise which boasted a glass bottom deck and a sprawling buffet, according to The Sun. The group were staying at a five star hotel in Paphos.",
      "And the publication claim that the holiday was Eamonn's first attempt to smooth over their crack, the first in their year long relationship. The Annabelle Hotel comes complete with swimming pools, four restaurants, a gym, a tennis court and a spa.",
      "In May last year, news emerged that Eamonn and Ruth had separated, ending 14 years of marriage.",
      "A source told the newspaper: \"Eamonn and Katie didn’t always look blissfully happy at the football, but at least they showed they are still an item. Eamonn’s moody face later might have been due to United conceding an equaliser to Fulham - denying his team a much needed win. The Northern Ireland air will have cheered him up for sure.\"",

      "Manchester United have confirmed a loan exit for young forward Ethan Williams. The teenager has signed a new deal at Old Trafford, extending his contract until 2028 before completing a season-long move to Falkirk.",
      "Williams took part in United's pre-season tour, scoring in a 4-1 friendly victory over Bournemouth. He spent the second half of last season on loan at Cheltenham, netting twice, and now faces a year in the Scottish top-flight.",
      "“We’re absolutely delighted to bring Ethan Williams to Falkirk,\" the Scottish club's manager John McGlynn said. He confirmed former United centre-back Jonny Evans played a part in the move, having taken on a new role at Old Trafford since his summer retirement.",
      "\"He’s a young player of real quality who has been developed in one of the best academies in the world at Manchester United, and he now has the chance to take the next step in his career with us,\" McGlynn added. \"Ethan is quick, direct, and has an eye for goal, qualities that we feel will add a different dimension to our attacking play and excite the supporters.",
      "“Ethan is a player we’ve had our eye on for some time, we were chasing this deal before the window even opened. It’s been a long road getting him to Falkirk with plenty of twists and turns along the way, but we always felt it was worth persevering with and we’re delighted to finally get it over the line.\"",
      "He joins a growing list of United stars to complete loan moves away from Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford is spending the season at Barcelona, with Toby Collyer at West Brom and Ethan Wheatley at Northampton.",
      "\"Last term, he did well with Cheltenham Town in League Two, scoring his first goals in senior football,\" United said in a statement about Williams once the loan was announced. \"A new experience awaits him north of the border, after a deal was concluded with the Bairns.\"",
      "There are still a few more deals left to be wrapped up. Among those is another loan, wit Rasmus Hojlund on the verge of trading Manchester for Napoli on loan with a view to a permanent switch next summer, and Alejandro Garnacho has now made a permanent move from United to Chelsea.",
      "United are also still working to complete a deal for Antony to return to Real Betis. The teams are a little apart on the financial terms, specifically concerning a potential payment to the Brazilian to make up for his wage drop.",
      "\"There is no agreement and we have withdrawn the transfer offer because Real Betis can't afford the transfer fee and the amounts that Manchester United must [instead] pay the player before the transfer,\" the Spanish club said in a statement on Friday. The winger thrived on loan at the club last season, but a permanent move - for a fee of around £21.6million - now hangs in the balance.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The youngster signed his first professional contract immediately after celebrating his 17th birthday and only the most highly regarded academy talents are given pro deals so quickly.",
      "However, disaster struck in August 2022 when it was confirmed that he'd ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee. Ennis faced a long road to recovery after that injury but he made up for lost time after that 14-month lay-off and has quickly got back to his best.",
      "The Cheshire-born youngster scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for United's Under-18s in 2021/22, his first full season at the club, and his finishing ability is one of his finest qualities.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Martinez, 32, has been itching to join United for several months and the club received short shrift from a loan enquiry earlier in the summer.",
      "The MEN revealed in January United were considering options to bolster their goalkeeper department and Senne Lammens of Royal Antwerp is another target.",
      "Roma have been the frontrunners to sign Sancho for a number of weeks but have failed to secure a breakthrough in discussions.",
      "Sancho, 25, had identified Italy as his likeliest escape route and held talks with Juventus earlier in the summer but Villa have emerged as a possible option.",
      "Martinez and Sancho are on similar wages, with the former on £200,000-a-week. Sancho’s is roughly the same due to the Champions League penalty clause that reduces a United player's salary by 25% if they fail to qualify for the competition.",
      "World Cup-winning 'keeper Martinez was left out of the Villa squad for their 3-0 home thrashing by Crystal Palace on Sunday. Villa coach Unai Emery admitted Martinez was not focused. Villa have struggled to strengthen their squad this summer and are winless after their first three Premier League games.",
      "Sancho has not made a Premier League appearance for United in more than two years. Chelsea paid a £5million penalty fee not to sign Sancho at the end of his season-long loan last term.",
      "The winger has entered the final ten months of his United deal and the club will almost certainly not trigger the one-year extension if Sancho is still under contract.",

This was decided by the shareholders' committee, the club’s supervisory body, on the recommendation of the management of Bayer 04. Training will be overseen by the current backroom staff on an interim basis.\"",

      "The window opened at the beginning of June before briefly closing due to the Club World Cup. United have conducted the majority of their business, but there is still work to do on the final day.",
      "The deadline is 7pm today, which is a four-hour shift from the traditional 11pm closure.",
      "Here are the deals United could complete on transfer deadline day:",
      "Lammens has been left out of successive Royal Antwerp squads and discussions with United continue. The goalkeeper has not agreed personal terms, but it's hoped a breakthrough can be reached.",
      "Galatasaray have been linked with a move for the Belgian shot-stopper ahead of the deadline.",
      "United admire Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who could be a potential alternative to Lammens, but the Argentina international earns £200,000 per week at Villa Park.",
      "United did not budget for the signing of a first-choice goalkeeper at the start of the window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has watched Altay Bayindir make mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby and made an error for their second goal.",
      "At the time of writing, Rasmus Hojlund's move to Napoli has yet to be confirmed. He is leaving on a season-long loan, with the obligation to make it permanent included.",
      "United will receive a €6million (£5.2m) loan fee for Hojlund and €44m (£38m) next summer when the obligation, which depends on certain conditions, is triggered.",

      "Will Antony complete his transfer to Real Betis? The Brazilian has held out for a move to Betis all summer after his loan last season, but the Spanish club have struggled to finance a deal.",
      "United would have to sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss, and it would not be a shock to see him join Betis as part of a fresh loan deal.",
      "It seemed like a deal was already agreed last Friday. Reports indicated a bid had been accepted and the terms of a permanent transfer had been agreed, but Betis released a formal statement saying: \"Betis has retired its offer. Betis cannot afford a transfer fee, nor the amounts the player is supposed to receive.\"",

      "Last month, Roma contacted United to discuss a loan move for Sancho with an obligation to buy for £20million next summer, but the Italians could not agree on personal terms with the winger.",
      "Sancho's move to Chelsea broke down due to his wage demands, so the London club decided to pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break their obligation to sign the winger. The 25-year-old needs to be realistic with his expectations for his next destination.",
      "United shifted Sancho at the eleventh hour last summer and it could go down to the wire again.",
      "Malacia recently celebrated his 26th birthday and interest has been sparse following his loan with PSV, but Spanish club Elche have been credited with late interest in the Dutch defender.",

      "The Manchester United boss was handed a lifeline this summer as the board backed him with transfers and allowed him a full pre-season schedule to right the wrongs from last season. The Red Devils finished a lacklustre 15th in the Premier League standings last term, with Amorim being frugal in his spending in the January window while moulding the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag.",
      "However, the 40-year-old has certainly made up for lost time this summer, spending more than £200million on a new frontline of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, with hopes of improved performances for his first full campaign.",
      "As a result of Mbeumo coming in on the right wing, Amorim has decided to deploy Amad as a wing-back, despite the young talent's strengths clearly coming in the form of his attack rather than defence. And it's a choice that has left Mowbray bamboozled.",
      "Speaking on No Tippy Tappy Football, the 61-year-old said: \"In my opinion, and can I say this from a position of total humility that he's manager of Manchester United, who am I? Who am I to tell him what to do? But in my stomach, it feels like you don't have to play 5-4-1, whatever you want to call it.",
      "\"You don't have to do it. If the group of players is screaming at you to play a three-man midfield to protect the mobility of a Casemiro if you want to play him or whoever it might be. You maybe have to put an extra man in there, so why would you be so stuck on one system and trying to force Amad as a right wing-back?",
      "\"Amad who's a brilliant footballer, Man United class I would suggest. I speak to Gary Pallister a lot about this when we sit and have coffee near my street most days. Amad, he's a genius.",
      "\"I talked about not having to look at the ball, the ball's stuck to his left foot. He is a brilliant football player, and a brilliant human being. And you're playing him at right wing-back just to fit into your system.\"",
      "Mowbray famously oversaw Amad during his loan stint with Sunderland between 2022 and 2023, where he scored 14 goals and provided four assists in 42 outings in the Championship. Speaking about his time with the talent, he added: \"Amad was one of the ones who wanted to get better and wanted to practice.",
      "\"He should be bending it in the top corner with his left foot, he should be sitting people on their backside and scoring wonderful goals like I know he can. Why's he chasing people into his own box playing right wing-back?\"",
      "A favourite on either wing, Amad started Manchester United's clashes with Fulham and Burnley at right wing-back, much to the hubbub of football fans worldwide. But with Mbeumo also able to operate either as a winger or a centre forward, the 23-year-old may find game time in his preferred position hard to come by this season.",

      "The 2025 summer transfer window is set to close earlier than usual this year. The deadline for Premier League and EFL clubs to sign players will be 7pm BST on Monday, 1 September.",
      "As per tradition, clubs will have a two-hour grace period after the window shuts to finalise deals, but only if the paperwork is submitted to the Football Association (FA) by 7pm. The transfer windows in La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A will all close simultaneously.",
      "In the past, the transfer window in England has closed at 11pm BST, but this has been brought forward following an agreement between the FA, Premier League and EFL. The change is intended to provide a more regular working pattern for staff involved in transfers, rather than the late nights and unsociable hours that have become associated with deadline day.",
      "However, Scotland's window will remain open until 11pm, while FIFA's international transfer deadline remains unchanged, closing at midnight. Saudi Arabia's window will stay open until Wednesday, 8 October.",
      "This follows the division of the summer transfer window into two parts this year, with the first phase having run from 1 to 10 June. The window was moved forward to allow teams participating in the Club World Cup the chance to sign players before the tournament kicked off on 15 June, reports the Express.",
      "Due to FIFA's rules, which state that a transfer window cannot last more than 16 weeks in a calendar year, the window was split this summer, reopening for a second time on Monday, 16 June.",
      "It's already been an incredibly busy summer for Premier League clubs. Manchester United have bolstered Ruben Amorim's attack with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, while Manchester City's activity was done in the first transfer window before the Club World Cup.",
      "Last year's spending stopped at £2.1 billion, while the previous record was set in 2023/24 with £2.5 billion. This summer's high spending is due to several high-profile signings and a £1.4 billion spend on forwards - about £850 million more than the amount spent on defenders.",
      "Before Monday's deadline, United are looking to sign a new goalkeeper, with Emi Martinez left out of Aston Villa's 3-0 home loss to Crystal Palace. City are also eyeing up another shot-stopper with Gianluigi Donnarumma linked.",

Bryan Mbeumo immediately regained United's lead, but yet another Altay Bayindir error gifted Burnley a late equaliser through Jaiden Anthony.",

      "Manchester United are doing everything they can to make a late attempt to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa ahead of Monday night's 7pm deadline, according to reports.",
      "United have been linked with the Argentina international throughout the window and were reportedly unsuccessful with a loan proposal. A new goalkeeper has been on Ruben Amorim's radar throughout the window amid uncertainty over Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "Bayindir has started all three of United's Premier League games this season, conceding four goals. Onana failed to cover himself in glory during the humiliating cup exit to Grimsby Town in his single appearance.",
      "In the last two weeks, Royal Antwerps' Senne Lammens appeared to be the most likely addition with the Belgian expected to come in and compete for the number one spot. However, that move has gone quiet recently.",
      "Now, with one day left of the transfer window, United are now reportedlyprioritising Martinez and are considering a late move to land the World Cup winner. Fabrizio Romano has now reported that United have made an approach to Villa for Martinez having agreed personal terms with the goalkeeper.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Martinez is set to be in action for Unai Emery's team on Sunday evening in their Premier League clash against Crystal Palace at Villa Park. Previously, it was reported that the goalkeeper was 'desperate' to move to Old Trafford.",
      "The latest twist in the saga comes in the shape of Villa and Lammens. Romano has also reported that the Villans have made a formal approach to Antwerp for Lammens.",
      "It's claimed that the Belgian is their main option alongside FC Porto's Diogo Costa to replace Martinez, if he does secure a late move to United.",
      "But, just a matter of hours later, The Telegraph reported that United had returned to Lammens and made the Belgian their priority signing for the goalkeeper position.",
      "The report states United have made an improved offer for Lammens, and that Martinez is their contingency should they fail to secure the Royal Antwerp star's signature.",

      "Manchester United put the disappointment of their Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby Town behind them with a dramatic 3-2 win over Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Burnley twice came from behind after a Josh Cullen own goal and Bryan Mbeumo's first Premier League goal for the Reds, but Bruno Fernandes' penalty kick in stoppage time was enough to secure all three points.",
      "United's international stars will now head off to represent their countries as club football is paused for the next fortnight, and the break may have come at a good time for United after they picked up some injury worries on Saturday.",
      "With that in mind, here is a look at the current injury situation at United heading into the September international break.",
      "Injury: Hamstring",
      "Cunha pulled up clutching his hamstring in the win over Burnley and was replaced by Joshua Zirkzee in the first half.",
      "He has withdrawn from the Brazil squad for their forthcoming World Cup qualifiers and Amorim is hopeful the injury isn't too serious.",
      "The United boss said: “It was hard to lose Cunha and Mason Mount, because Mason Mount played 30 minutes with an injury.",
      "“I’m concerned about that, because they are so important for us. We will see. I don’t know [how they are], I don’t know. We will check them. We need those guys really bad to be really competitive.”",
      "Estimated return date: Unknown",
      "Injury: Unknown",
      "Mount was excellent in the first half of the win over Burnley but was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo at half-time.",
      "Amorim revealed he played 30 minutes with an injury and after his injury-riddled first two seasons at the club, United will be hopeful his positive start to the season won't be curtailed by another knock.",
      "Estimated return date: Unknown",
      "Injury: Knee",
      "The Argentina international suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury last season but he has been back in training and is targeting a return to action after the September international break.",
      "Estimated return date: Man City (A), September 14",

      "Brighton & Hove Albion have made a decision over Carlos Baleba amid transfer links with Manchester United.",
      "The Athletic previously reported that United are keen on Baleba as they look to bolster their midfield options ahead of the summer transfer window deadline. It has been suggested that the Reds have reached out to Brighton via intermediaries to discuss potential terms for a transfer.",
      "However, it's worth noting that Brighton are reportedly keen to retain the Cameroon international for at least another year and have reportedly slapped a price tag of more than £100million on him. And Brighton's firm stance has been reinforced by their decision to name him in their starting line-up for Sunday afternoon's clash at home to Manchester City.",
      "Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler has insisted in the build-up to Sunday's game that Baleba will remain a Brighton player.",
      "Asked whether he was 100 per cent confident Baleba would stay, Hurzeler told a press conference: “Yes. If there is a number more than 100, I would even say more than 100. I am confident.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is coming to the end of his maiden summer transfer window at Old Trafford, and he has spent big on new recruits over the past couple of months. More than £200m has been splashed on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim failed to find success with his ageing midfield made up of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen last term and will be hoping to get a new midfielder in before Monday's deadline.",

      "Manchester United are said to have never been in an advanced situation to sign Senne Lammens during this summer transfer window.",
      "Talks continue as United push to sign the goalkeeper before the deadline. There is no agreement on personal terms as of yet, but there is hope that a breakthrough remains possible, with Royal Antwerp keen to cash in.",
      "Lammens has not played over the last two weekends after being left out of their matchday squads to prevent injury. Emiliano Martinez is admired and could be a potential alternative, with reports emerging on Sunday that the club have agreed personal terms with the World Cup winner. The Aston Villa goalkeeper currently earns weekly wages of £200,000, but unlike current first-choice goalkeeper Andre Onana he would not miss a period of the current season during the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "\"They've clearly got a bit of an issue in terms of whether there's a market for Andre Onana; it doesn't seem to be the case at the moment; you never know before the deadline. Maybe more plausible, you can move on Altay Bayindir there, but he's playing at the moment.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"It's plausible that more than one comes in, but that would give them an excess of goalkeepers. Then, they really have the issue of the Africa Cup of Nations on the horizon, and they want to upgrade in that area, that's long been understood.",
      "\"Senne Lammens of Royal Antwerp is a player they've looked at and have an interest in. I don't think the situation has ever been as advanced as some have suggested, but let's see what develops on that front.",
      "\"And then, of course, there are continued reports around Emi Martinez, for whom they made a loan inquiry earlier in the window; it didn't develop then; let's see if it does now. The suggestion from Villa until this point has been that they expect Emi Martinez to stay, despite what we saw from him at the end of last season in that very emotional scene on the pitch that looked like a departure was coming.\"",

      "",
      "There was a curious internal and external move to try and label Arsenal as the title favourites heading into the game at Anfield, which manifested itself in a sort of underdog portrayal of the actual champions who are about to become the first club to ever spend more than £400m in a single transfer window.",
      "Mo Salah reiterated that they “have a team that has played for five, six years, they understand each other’s game and they also have a manager with the team for five, six years”.",
      "But if Liverpool need to imagine they are the valiant pretenders in this almighty title battle then they should feel free. Perhaps it gave them the level-headedness and clarity to see the game through.",
      "Their previous 1-0 wins under Arne Slot had come against Leicester, Everton and Crystal Palace. Not since Salah scored in a narrow victory over Manchester City in October 2022 had Liverpool beaten a Big Six opponent by that scoreline. It was a welcome show of variation from the new entertainers.",

      "The West Ham manager pretended that “you get written off in your job after a week” because “this is the world we’re in”, as if West Ham hadn’t taken the joint-fewest points of any side who had been in the Premier League throughout his eight-month tenure and he was only under pressure because woke.",
      "But he earned the opportunity to give some back after what felt like a transformational afternoon out of nowhere.",
      "Their best and most committed player by a ludicrous margin was left arguing with a supporter days before after a third consecutive defeat to start the season, all of which had seen the Hammer concede three goals.",
      "Then came news of Lucas Paqueta’s seemingly imminent departure, a blow softened by the boost that Nayef Aguerd had refused to travel to the Midlands.",
      "Heading into the international break void away at a team which had started with a win and a draw after spending over £160m this season, it was seemingly designed specifically to be Potter’s final stand.",
      "Yet Bowen scored as he tends to, Paqueta did the same before mugging off Fabrizio Romano, and Callum Wilson earned a presumably ungodly goal bonus while Crysencio Summerville emerged as a genuine game-changer, Mateus Fernandes showed that midfielders can have mobility and Kyle Walker-Peters actually defended his back post.",
      "Potter’s switch to a four-man defence helped change the mood completely. That was his biggest win in any game since October 2022, and equalled his best ever away in the Premier League. The critics are far from silenced but he will welcome them at least having to mutter under their breath for a while.",
      "",
      "While no different to any other manager in that there is a perception among the fanbase that his substitutions are often either wrong or timed poorly, the difference with Hurzeler is that he has a uniquely strong hand to shuffle as a coach outside the elite.",
      "“For me it’s important to have the courage to make the decisions and not wait until something happens, because making the decisions with substitutions you can change the game,” he said after turning a 0-0 draw with Ipswich into a 2-0 win in January, which some might argue is roughly the same as conjuring victory from a defeat to Manchester City.",
      "There is definite outcome bias at play; if Brighton had been hit on the break, conceded again and slumped to a loss after that quadruple substitution then Hurzeler would be slammed for his naivety and foolishness. But he sensed a shift in the game with neither side having had a shot for 15 minutes and acted upon it.",
      "Brighton had the next four attempts including James Milner’s penalty equaliser, then weathered a mild two-shot storm in response from the visitors before having seven unanswered efforts on goal, culminating with Brajan Gruda’s winner.",
      "Two substitutes scoring after being introduced at 1-0 down, while Pep Guardiola chucked on Rico Lewis and Ruben Dias to try and salvage a point. As Hurzeler said, it was all about “energy” and “belief”. Rarely do you see either transfer between teams during a game so dramatically.",
      "",
      "A top-flight club-record unbeaten run, with the first Thursday-Sunday away grind of the season navigated without conceding a goal, having sold their best player while manoeuvring through continued speculation over their captain and being unable to name anything close to a full bench because of injuries and a lack of squad depth.",
      "Oliver Glasner is a magician and these are uncharted waters Crystal Palace are plainly sailing on.",
      "He must be backed over Marc Guehi. As Glasner said, it’s “tempting” to take the money for a player out of contract at the end of the season, but it feels as though Palace are on the brink of something special and there is a danger of jeopardising that by valuing the financial aspect of a deal too highly.",
      "If keeping Guehi gives them a better chance of renewing Glasner’s own terms before they expire next summer, it is entirely worth taking that hit. Glasner is “responsible for sports” and there is no-one better pound-for-pound in the Premier League, if not across the European coaching landscape as a whole.",
      "",
      "Mind you…",
      "Bournemouth sold three-quarters of their starting defence in the summer and had their loan keeper return to his parent club. They have the lowest net spend of any team in Europe this summer by some way. Their 10 most recent first-team signings all had limited to no Premier League experience when they joined.",
      "Their most-used XI last season and the line-up which so thoroughly beat Spurs on their own patch shared three players: Adam Smith, Antoine Semenyo and Evanilson. And they appear to be better, more cohesive and more stable than last season.",
      "Iraola does feel eventually destined for something greater but only to the sort of level Bournemouth’s biggest player sales have been to this summer: your Real Madrids, your Paris Saint-Germains, your Liverpools, your Brentfords.",
      "Amine Adli personally hunting down the entire Spurs backline and midfield to retrieve a ball he didn’t even lose before getting his head down to sprint on a counter-attack, all in stoppage time away at a Champions League side, was emblematic of a team few can match physically or technically.",
      "It is ridiculous how high that Bournemouth ceiling is both collectively and as individuals.",
      "",
      "The results undoubtedly help but there is an overriding sense that Everton are just enjoying having actual fun.",
      "They have scored 34 goals in 24 matches under David Moyes at a rate of 1.42 per game, compared to the 1.19 managed by Sean Dyche.",
      "There have been zero goalless draws under Moyes, whereas Dyche had five in his last 13 fixtures.",
      "In only six games under Moyes have Everton failed to score, with Dyche sacked after a miserable run of ten matches in which the Toffees drew a blank eight times.",
      "One of those managers did have a Jack Grealish able to thrive again as the big fish in a smaller pond, as well as Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to help facilitate that. But that coach did also revitalise Beto while coaxing twice as many goals out of Iliman Ndiaye in 420 fewer minutes, so…",
      "",
      "It is a neat inverse of the recent promoted team archetype to beat sides established in the Premier League while losing to those you came up with.",
      "Sunderland would probably take a couple of chastening setbacks against Burnley and Leeds if they were routinely sandwiched between the sort of results they have to deliver against precisely the kind of club they should be looking to replace in the top flight.",
      "West Ham and Brentford are among that vulnerable subsect of teams which have been systematically weakened by the elite this summer. These games might not have explicitly carried the six-pointer label in the build-up but they will be imbued with no less importance if the tag is added retrospectively in discussing how they stayed up.",
      "Pulling those entrenched sides into trouble is the difficult part. In the last two seasons, the most wins a promoted team has recorded against non-promoted clubs was Luton with five in 2023/24, and none of the last six teams who came up ever recorded consecutive victories at home before their relegation was confirmed.",
      "Sunderland at least look well-equipped to make it interesting.",
      "",
      "A timely reminder, in spite of their apparent discovery of competence on the pitch, that they remain a delightful ball of insanity off it.",
      "One two-month injury to a rotated centre-forward should not prompt the cancelling of a loan to Bayern Munich and the recall of a striker from Sunderland while prompting speculation over another transfer.",

      "It is difficult to recall a more consequential recent Aston Villa defeat than their loss at Old Trafford on the final day of last season. At least the player largely responsible for the setback which helped cost them Champions League qualification isn’t trying to return to that scene while burning every bridge back to Birmingham he can find.",
      "Yet this cannot be pinned solely on Emi Martinez. His conduct and that situation has not helped but Villa look broken and lost on and off the pitch.",
      "Tyrone Mings calling for the squad “to act as professionally as possible” after the surrender to Crystal Palace felt desperate. The focus on simply surviving the rest of the transfer window, assessing the damage incurred by this team over the summer and moving on seems forlorn.",
      "Half-time substitute Emi Buendia should not be leading your team for tackles, nor should 17-year-old Bradley Burrowes have to be thrown on for his Premier League debut as a simultaneous message to the board and to Matty Cash for continuing to be Matty Cash.",
      "For all the talk of needing new faces to freshen things up, £26m summer signing Evann Guessand only lasted the first half and was still tackled more times than anyone all game.",
      "Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins have attracted interest and an internal valuation of around £140m yet Villa are the only team in the entire English football pyramid yet to score a league goal this season.",
      "And adding most of a painfully ordinary Jadon Sancho’s earnings to a disastrous wage-to-revenue ratio does not feel like a happy solution.",

      "",
      "Not sure there is ever a particularly good time to lose 3-0 at home to a side previously without a win but the inopportune timing of that Nottingham Forest setback on the eve of a crunch meeting with the volatile owner was not lost on Nuno.",
      "His previous Premier League sacking was brought about by a home defeat by the same scoreline to a hapless United, and meted out by an exacting and unforgiving chairman. Perhaps Nuno should start considering his choices and the consequences of his actions more thoroughly.",

      "While others at least make a vague effort to prepare for the race ahead, Wolves turn up at the blocks half-dressed and facing backwards.",
      "They essentially write off August every year. Their results in the opening month of every top-flight campaign since promotion in 2018 make for hilariously painful reading: 26 games, two wins, nine draws and 15 defeats.",
      "One of those victories was in lockdown September against an atrocious Sheffield United; the other came two years ago against Everton, who instead sent them into this international break at as low an ebb as is imaginable for a Premier League side.",
      "Wolves handicap themselves so thoroughly each season that it should come as no surprise. A transfer policy predicated on selling their best players and taking time to replace them with inferior ones means the pressure builds, momentum doesn’t and the revolving door of coaches never really stops spinning.",
      "It just feels like there is probably a middle ground between embracing their position in the food chain and meticulously identifying rough diamonds to polish and upsell, and sacrificing the first three or so matches of every season to facilitate that role. Once clubs get lost in that cycle it tends to end only one way.",
      "",
      "Every aspect of the modern Southampton survival blueprint is to be avoided at all costs and although predominantly playing in the same colour kit cannot be helped, Brentford really could have done without copying their bizarre outlook on penalties.",

      "But the point stands: while Will Osula makes up for a lack of decisive quality 100 times over with his work rate and self-sacrifice, that is never going to be enough to lead a team already defined by its energy, effort and intensity.",
      "Newcastle need something different, a goal threat which weaves seamlessly with that tone-setting desire and application. And as Howe said, “one more player” even after a club-record transfer is probably necessary with the Alexander Isak saga almost over.",
      "Of course a starting line-up in which Bruno Guimaraes had the most career Premier League goals (22) was held to a 0-0 draw. Jacob Murphy (19) and Fabian Schar (18) completed that depressing podium and leaving out £90m of starting wingers before bringing them on with nothing to aim for did not help.",
      "Newcastle lost as many games as they won when having 60 per cent of the ball or more in the Premier League last season. A pair of goalless draws with a possession share only just under that does not suggest the issue has been sorted over a summer of transfer distraction and disturbance.",
      "Woltemade and Yoane Wissa will be placed into a competent enough structure but the need for them to show what well over £100m can bring beyond that is immediate.",
      "",
      "Marco Bizot. Marco Bizot. The time is over.",
      "Add Alexander Isak to this unbeaten Liverpool side and they absolutely have to win the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal need not be the ‘nearly’ side; without Mikel Arteta’s caution they could achieve more. So says John Nicholson, who is Not A Fan.",
      "Nobody really cares or remembers if you are wrong about transfers. Unless, and this caveat is crucial, you are an absolute dick about it.",
      "We have Arsenal and Liverpool reactions to that borefest at Anfield which some feeling better about Mikel Arteta. Not everybody though.",
      "What’s this? A Transfer Deadline Day that cannot be overhyped? Oh, you sexy b*stard. Follow all the gossip and done deals live with F365…",
      "Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot were in agreement about Arsenal, Liverpool and magic moments. Gary Neville and Gabriel Martinelli gave us plenty more to go at."

      "Man Utd have reached a ‘total agreement’ to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeper Senne Lammens ahead of the deadline, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein.",
      "The Red Devils have been on the lookout for a new goalkeeper this summer after Andre Onana’s poor performances in the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Altay Bayindir has moved ahead of Onana in the pecking order as Ruben Amorim chose to start the Turkey international in their first three Premier League matches of the season.",
      "Onana did start their League Cup defeat to Grimsby Town with the Cameroon international making two big mistakes as Man Utd were knocked out on penalties by the League Two outfit.",
      "And the goalkeeping situation at the club has led Man Utd to line up a goalkeeper signing on deadline day with Lammens about to move to Old Trafford.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano wrote on X on Monday morning: ‘Manchester United have agreed personal terms with Emiliano Martínez and approached Aston Villa! As exclusively revealed this morning, Dibu is back as concrete option for #MUFC if Lammens deal doesn’t happen. Talks well underway now.’",
      "Before he later added: ‘Emi Martínez has told Aston Villa that he wants to join Manchester United. Clear message again after the game as personal terms are agreed with #MUFC. Talks continue also re Sancho. Man Utd also keep talks active for Lammens… who’s #AVFC target if Dibu leaves.’",
      "But now The Athletic journalist Ornstein has revealed that Man Utd have ‘reached total agreement’ for the signing of Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Ornstein added: ‘A fee of €21million (£18.2m) plus add ons has been agreed between the two clubs with no sell-on clause included.",
      "‘Lammens, 23, is travelling to Manchester with personal terms on a five-year contract agreed as all parties work towards completing a deal before Monday’s 7pm UK deadline.’",

      "Aston Villa goalkeeper Martinez could now be forced to stay at Villa Park but Romano has revealed that Galatasaray is an option, while ‘solutions are being explored’.",
      "After Ornstein’s story, Romano continued on X: ‘After Manchester United proceeding with Senne Lammens deal, solutions are being explored for Dibu Martínez. Argentina goalkeeper being discussed with Galatasaray in the recent hours.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Emiliano Martinez has told Aston Villa that he wants to join Man Utd before the transfer deadline.",

      "Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has been sacked by Bayer Leverkusen after just three games in charge of the Bundesliga club.",
      "The Dutchman only took over from Xabi Alonso this summer but has reportedly already fallen out with the Leverkusen hierarchy and a draw and a defeat from their first two league games has seen him sacked from the role.",
      "Simon Rolfes, managing director of sport, said: “This decision was not an easy one for us. Nobody wanted to take this step. However, the past few weeks have shown that building a new and successful team with this setup is not feasible. We firmly believe in the quality of our team and will now do everything we can to take the next steps in our development with a new setup.”",
      "CEO Fernando Carro said: “A parting of ways at this early stage of the season is painful, but we felt it was necessary. We remain committed to achieving our goals for the season – and to do that, we need the best possible conditions at all levels and across the entire first team. Now it’s a matter of fully implementing and utilising these conditions again.”",
      "The sudden departure comes after a 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen, a result that saw club captain Robert Andrich tear into his team-mates.",

      "“Everyone played for themselves, everyone ran around the pitch on their own,” Andrich said. “We have too many players who are preoccupied with other things or only with themselves. I don’t know if I’ve ever experienced that at Bayer.",
      "“The disastrous final phase was a symbol of our current situation. This has nothing to do with any unrest, player transfers, or legal proceedings.",
      "“They see: They’re leading 2-1, could make it 3-1, and are discussing a penalty first. These are the little things that build up an opponent. We can’t stand around for two minutes and play rock-paper-scissors to see who’s going to take the penalty. That’s one of many things that aren’t going well for us at the moment.”",
      "Ten Hag’s task was also not made any easier by the number of outgoings from the club this summer. The team that Alonso guided to an invincible league campaign in 2023-24 has been picked apart, with Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Amine Adli, Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka all leaving. Meanwhile Alonso went to Real Madrid.",
      "Ten Hag admitted at the weekend that having players leave “hurts.”",
      "“Letting good players leave always hurts,” he said. “But we also have other good players and they then need to take on that task.”",
      "Ten Hag has now been sacked from his two previous jobs, having lost the United gig in October 2024.",

      "Losing at home to West Ham has left Nuno Espirito Santo in some quite considerable trouble. Even more than Ruben Amorim.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that, even if Potter is far from out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Even more entertainingly, it might even be Jose Mourinho…",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Amorim could resign or be sacked but as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",
      "There’s once again a ‘feeling at Man Utd that Amorim may resign’ and we can add being rubbish to a list of reasons including a dodgy knee and the lack ...",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has repeated an unforgivable Erik Ten Hag move at Manchester United, while a surprise favourite emerges to replace him.",
      "Some players in the Man Utd dressing room are questioning the tactics deployed by Ruben Amorim so far this season, according to reports."

      "Liverpool were showing off with a scrappy title race win. Potter, Hurzeler, Glasner and Iraola impressed but Aston Villa and Wolves are in free fall.",
      "Add Alexander Isak to this unbeaten Liverpool side and they absolutely have to win the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal need not be the ‘nearly’ side; without Mikel Arteta’s caution they could achieve more. So says John Nicholson, who is Not A Fan.",
      "Nobody really cares or remembers if you are wrong about transfers. Unless, and this caveat is crucial, you are an absolute dick about it.",
      "We have Arsenal and Liverpool reactions to that borefest at Anfield which some feeling better about Mikel Arteta. Not everybody though.",
      "Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot were in agreement about Arsenal, Liverpool and magic moments. Gary Neville and Gabriel Martinelli gave us plenty more to go at."

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

The sight of him, 2-0 down to League Two opposition and fiddling about with magnets on his tactics board, already has a McClaren’s Umbrella feel to it.",
      "If Amorim is done for, the next question becomes who could take over at Manchester United? We have the big names with the latest odds here…",
      "",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund boss was high in the reckoning for the Tottenham job, mostly we suspect because he is available. The same criteria could get him the nod here, and it’s fair to say that former Dortmund bosses have generally done okay in Our League.",
      "",
      "Has done quietly brilliant things at Fulham, but would Manchester United settle for quietly brilliant things? They probably should, they definitely won’t.",
      "",
      "United missed their chance back in summer 2024 when Chelsea cruelly discarded him, but any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until next summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",
      "",
      "",
      "Has extended his Germany contract until after Euro 2028, which would appear to rule him out, but the lure of the elite club game can be strong and Nagelsmann in the Premier League has long felt inevitable somewhere down the line.",
      "",
      "According to reports in Spain: ‘At Manchester United, some directors believe that Xavi could be the ideal man to rebuild the team, especially since his style of play resembles what they have been looking for since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.’",
      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an “interesting” club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Backed in over recent days as talk continues to swirl around his Nottingham Forest future. He’s a fine manager, but we simply cannot see United going for this at all. Especially given how his previous attempt to manage a Big Six banter club turned out.",
      "",
      "Would ‘knows the club’ trump the fact that Carrick has not long been sacked by a Championship club? It didn’t work out brilliantly for Frank Lampard at Chelsea, but it remains a curiously beguiling CV booster even at the very heftiest of clubs.",

      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",

      "The Saturday 3pm slot has been decimated and desecrated more than ever this Premier League season, but it refuses to go quietly.",
      "The third Saturday of the season delivered in style, with a thrilling late win for Sunderland, a desperate face-saving late win for Burnley, the sight of Jack Grealish falling in love with football again in real time, and Spurs crashing Spursily back down to earth with a shocking performance in defeat at home to Bournemouth, who somehow keep on trucking despite having the heart ripped out of their team over the summer.",
      "Andoni Iraola might just be a genius, while Ruben Amorim looks more lucky general after a late VAR intervention spared United more blushes after a truly mortifying week.",
      "Here’s the F365 3pm Blackout on a belting afternoon of fun and games…",
      "It says a great deal about Manchester United these days that even when you sit and ponder what a 97th-minute winner might mean as a sliding doors moment for club, player and manager you still come to the conclusion ‘Probably not much’.",
      "There just seems too much too fundamentally broken at Old Trafford – literally and figuratively – for a spawny late home win over a promoted side to mark any kind of significant corner-turning. It will mean slightly less noise and attention through the international break – and gratitude must be extended from one banter club to another here as Spurs gamely take on the mantle after a truly abysmal effort against Bournemouth – but we’ve been here so many times with United, under so many managers.",
      "It’s not even the first time Ruben Amorim’s team have performed absurd acts of late escapology; it’s never really amounted to anything much before, it’s unlikely to do so now. The sheer amount of times they get themselves into these situations remains more compelling than the admittedly often eye-catching times they manage to extract themselves.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Relegation six-pointers are always big games, and at the end of the day it doesn’t really matter how you win them.",
      "But this was about as unconvincing a win as it’s possible to imagine against a team that had been so thoroughly sorted out on their previous away day. And by United’s banter-club rivals to boot.",
      "Twice Burnley were able to peg United back after falling behind, exposing yet again the fragility at the heart of this team.",
      "The slapstick nature of United’s first goal – ricocheting home off the unfortunate Josh Cullen – and cruelty of the winner, a penalty awarded by VAR in the very last moments of added time, will also temper any talk of this being a game that marks a significant piece of actual progress or development for United.",
      "They have avoided further humiliation at the end of a week that has contained a season’s worth of it already. But no more than that.",
      "",
      "Another late, late Wilson Isidor goal at the Stadium of Light and, while the gloss-applier in a thumping win over West Ham was certainly enjoyable this one might just carry a bit more weight in the final analysis.",
      "Having fallen behind in the 77th minute, to emerge from this game with all three points is a seismic effort from Regis Le Bris’ play-off winners. It also marks a second home win for them against teams among the more obviously vulnerable of the previously Settled Seventeen.",
      "Nothing looks settled now with all three promoted sides showing they are ready and willing to compete. The idea of it being impossible to do so has already been slightly exposed, while it also seems relevant to note that not one of the six teams to perform the promotion-relegation double in the last couple of years has subsequently looked out of place in the Championship.",
      "The fear of a new normal was valid, with each passing season only helping the sides already in place get more and more comfortable, but it really is starting to look more quirk than permanent arrangement, a combination of an undeniable strengthening of the lower reaches of the Premier League with a series of painfully ill-equipped promoted sides.",
      "With all three promoted sides showing their teeth after a summer where the Premier League’s big beasts have shamelessly feasted on the rest, neither of those factors appears to be in play this season. Which could make for an awful lot of fun.",
      "",
      "One of the great features of Spursiness is the way it so often seems to be specifically designed to torture the club’s fans into genuine madness.",
      "And they do love to make sure the whiplash is as severe as possible when the rug is pulled from under a fanbase the club itself seems to genuinely despise. Two wins from two had been followed by the sort of statement signing that prompts inevitable overexcitement.",
      "Xavi Simons was in the building but unavailable, on precisely the sort of occasion where precisely his sort of football was required. Yet if Spurs could just find a way past Bournemouth they would have likely gone into the international break top of the league and full of joy.",
      "Long-term Spurs watchers will be ahead of us here, but those two words ‘international break’ are enough to tell you that simply couldn’t happen.",
      "Spurs have now ensured their supporters have spent the last seven international breaks stewing on a defeat – and usually a particularly wretched one. The last time they won directly before an international break was a scarcely deserved 1-0 win in October 2023 against Luton, who have since been relegated twice.",
      "Since then, Spurs have lost before international breaks to Wolves (from 1-0 up at 90 minutes), Fulham (3-0), Newcastle, Brighton (from 2-0 up at half-time), Ipswich (at home), Fulham (again) and now Bournemouth in a game that should have ended far more compellingly than 1-0 to the visitors such was their dominance.",
      "Andoni Iraola’s side controlled the game to an astonishing degree after a half-awake Spurs defence with Cristian Romero inattentive and a dawdling Djed Spence playing Evanilson onside to score what would prove to be the only goal.",
      "That it remained the only goal was mostly down to a lack of clinical finishing from the visitors, because Spurs created nothing.",
      "Iraola really is a genius; to have had the heart ripped out of his defence the way he has this summer and then set his team up to so utterly nullify Spurs was a huge achievement, even allowing for the role Spurs played in their own downfall by appearing to regard such concepts as ‘ideas’ or ‘movement’ as essentially cheating.",
      "This was a world away from the varied but excellent performances under Thomas Frank against PSG, Burnley and Man City, and a perhaps necessary reality check for just how far off proper, sensible clubs last year’s 17th-place finishers remain.",
      "By the time Spurs mustered their first shot of any kind just before the hour mark, Bournemouth had already had 15. The final tally, even as Spurs threw players and long balls into the penalty area with increasing frequency and desperation, still read an absurd 19-5 in Bournemouth’s favour.",
      "Not one of Spurs’ efforts troubled Bournemouth. All of Spurs’ effort will have troubled Spurs.",
      "",
      "A happy Jack Grealish is something surely all of us can get behind. Okay, maybe not Wolves fans.",
      "But for the rest of us there is undoubted joy in watching him simply Enjoying His Football again as he took his assist tally for the season to four with two more in an entertaining win over Wolves. Some players really are just more effective as the brightest shining light in a more ordinary team than as another cog in a brilliant machine.",
      "There’s no shame in that. There’s nothing wrong with that. And Grealish is one such player. He doesn’t turn 30 until next month; there really could be an awful lot left to come in a career that now has all the baubles and trimmings of being part of Man City’s stunning run of recent success.",
      "But one suspects that what Grealish might achieve at Everton might just bring him far more joy than trophies and medals ever could. Although he might miss the parades."

      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "Barrott was then told to review the decision by VAR Stuart Atwell. After a three-minute review, Barrott awarded a penalty for a \"sustained pulling action\" from Anthony on Amad. The shirt pull started outside the penalty area.",

      "Similar to the later penalty that was awarded, the contact began outside of the area before the pair ended up on the floor in the area.",
      "In this case, Barrott awarded the penalty; however, following a five-minute review and being advised to check the screen, the on-field decision was overturned with a drop-ball awarded to the Clarets.",
      "\"When Kyle Walker makes initial contact, he's about a foot outside of the area, so I think it might be overturned and given a free-kick outside [the penalty area]. The actual contact is on the back of his calf and it's outside the area.",
      "\"If it's outside, it's factual [so it should be overturned]. It's in or out. So for me it's a free-kick for United from outside the area, in my opinion.\n\"The initial contact was outside and then he's fallen inside.

      "Saturday 30 August 2025 19:28, UK",
      "Chelsea have signed Alejandro Garnacho in a £40m transfer from Manchester United, taking their summer spend to nearly £300m.",
      "The 21-year-old winger becomes Chelsea's ninth arrival, joining new attackers Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens, and increases their outlay to £296.8m.",

      "\"I can't wait to get started,\" he told the Chelsea website. \"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"",
      "A compromise over Garnacho's valuation had to be reached as United valued him at £50m, which was more than Chelsea were prepared to pay.",
      "United negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.",
      "The deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate.",
      "Garnacho turned down offers from other clubs because he wanted to move to Chelsea. The winger was told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",

      "Bayern have been informed that Chelsea will not be able to proceed with the proposed deal due to an injury to Liam Delap against Fulham.",

      "The player is now expected to return to London. He will go straight back into the first-team squad.",
      "He has been training with the first-team squad as there was always the possibility he would stay.",
      "He signed an extension last September and his contract runs to 2033.",
      "Chelsea have sent Barcelona a £36.6m (€40m) written bid for Fermin Lopez.",
      "They are now waiting for a response after submitting the offer on Saturday.",
      "\"We've reported in the past that Chelsea were considering opening bids of £25m. I know some Manchester United supporters were very angry with those reports.",
      "\"It's all been sorted out now. It's a £40m fixed fee and United will also retain a 10 per cent sell-on clause for the player.",
      "\"This is a significant deal for United. They are often criticised for not getting enough for players and not making money from selling players. This is the largest ever sale for a Manchester United academy product.",

      "Leny Yoro did not feature in Manchester United's disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup; United still searching for their first win of the season after defeat to Arsenal and a draw at Fulham in the Premier League; they host Burnley on Saturday",
      "By Danyal Khan - @danyalhkhan",
      "Saturday 30 August 2025 18:07, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",
