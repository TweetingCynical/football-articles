      "Manchester United fans have been left stunned after Ruben Amorim took a swipe at the club's famous academy. United manager Amorim has been criticised for not involving enough homegrown players during his troubled 13-month reign at Old Trafford.",
      "Only three youngsters - Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi - have debuted under the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss, who flooded his team with academy products at his former club. Amorim, though, has suggested that two of those three alongside Toby Collyer - who made his debut under Erik ten Hag - were promoted to the first-team too early.",
      "Obi featured in the senior squad last season but has mainly trained United's under-21s this term while Harry Amass has been a regular since joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan. Collyer, meanwhile, is back at United recovering from an injury after making four appearances on loan at West Bromwich Albion.",
      "While discussing the future of Kobbie Mainoo, United's star academy graduate of the past few seasons, Amorim began criticising the club's youth system. \"He (Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here,\" the Red Devils boss began.",
      "\"He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever.",
      "\"It's the situation, what's happened. I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Amorim was likely referencing Wednesday's troubles as opposed to Amass' own performances. The Championship club want to extend the left-back's loan until the end of the season.",
      "United fans reacted with fury, with one posting on X: \"What is Amorim trying to achieve with those quotes about Mainoo and the academy? Honestly just self sabotage at this point.\" Another said: \"Slagging off our academy players to defend his stubbornness is a new low for Amorim.\"",
      "A third followed up by writing: \"Ruben Amorim throwing the academy players under the bus, knowing full well the fundamentals of the club's history is built on the academy surely has to be the final straw for (Jason) Wilcox and INEOS. He's not the right man for the job and we must act before we lose more youth talents.\"",
      "United supporters also fear that the club's remarkable record of featuring a homegrown player in every matchday squad for the last 88 years (more than 4,300 games) will come to an end under Amorim due to his lack of trust. In November, midfielder Jack Fletcher was called up for the Red Devils' trip to Tottenham, ensuring that the record stayed intact.",
      "\"There is something special in our club which has to be bullet proof. The way we behave, the way we feel [about] the club. We are not going to stop with academy players. It doesn't matter about the result.",
      "\"We will continue with these small details which are the foundations of our club. We have that record, we won't break that record. And Jack is ready to help us. We will show that our academy is our future. The players in our academy must be ready to help us.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A sense of déjà vu swept through the Stade Velodrome as Mason Greenwood once again stole the show for Marseille in another December triumph over Monaco. Almost exactly 12 months on from his previous heroics, the Manchester United academy graduate rose to the occasion to deliver the crucial blow against Les Monegasques on Sunday.",
      "Greenwood, 24, netted the game's only goal in the 82nd minute, pouncing on Pierre Emile-Hojbjerg's delivery just inside the penalty area. He then unleashed a thunderous strike into the top-right corner, sparking wild celebrations among the home supporters at the Velodrome.",
      "The victory maintains Marseille's pursuit of the Ligue 1 crown, sitting five points behind table-toppers Lens and just four adrift of reigning champions PSG. French media coverage was dominated by Greenwood's match-winning heroics, though goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli also earned his share of the acclaim.",
      "Le Figaro branded Greenwood \"indispensable\" after his late dramatics, a familiar theme following his double against Union Saint-Gilloise that secured a 3-2 Champions League victory last week. The paper's glowing assessment read: \"Lively at times, then quiet, the English striker once again produced a moment of brilliance to rescue his team.\"",
      "Rulli and Nayef Aguerd delivered their own crucial interventions in the dying moments to maintain the shutout. Once more, Foot Mercato reserved its highest praise for Greenwood following his magical intervention.",
      "A section from the match report read: \"Under pressure for much of the match, Marseille secured this hard-fought win and can thank Rulli and Greenwood for this laborious victory.\"",
      "Le Phoceen heaped even greater plaudits on the former England international. Greenwood earned a match rating of 8.5 out of 10, matching Rulli as the top-rated performer at the Velodrome.",
      "\"Another commanding performance from Greenwood, who played with the impression that he could decide the fate of a play at will,\" it said. \"His first half was bursting with activity: he dropped deep, accelerated 20 metres, broke lines, and forced Monaco to defend deep.",
      "\"Even when the team was under pressure, he continued to create danger with his dribbling and changes of pace. And then there was that clinical goal: control, a quick finish, top corner, no question about it.\"",
      "Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi, who recently tipped Greenwood as a potential Ballon d'Or contender, revealed post-match that he had nearly substituted the winger moments before his decisive strike. He emphasised the player's unpredictability, capable of changing the game's momentum in an instant.",
      "Le Meridional went even further with its praise, branding Greenwood \"unstoppable,\" particularly in that crucial moment. The victory ensured Marseille retained third spot in Ligue 1, made all the sweeter considering the decisive moment came against bitter rivals.",
      "\"Unstoppable, 1-0 to Marseille,\" read one extract. \"The goalscorer takes off his shirt in euphoria, receives a yellow card, but most importantly scores his 11th Ligue 1 goal of the season, cementing his status as the linchpin of Marseille's attack. His 32nd goal in 49 league matches.\"",

      "Manchester United could finally land one of Louis van Gaal's former targets with Sergio Ramos now a free agent. The Real Madrid legend signed for Mexican outfit Monterrey back in February after one season back at his beloved Sevilla.",
      "His Mexican adventure wrapped up after 10 months, with Ramos confirming his exit from the club earlier this month. With no indication he's ready to hang up his boots just yet, the 39-year-old hasn't yet revealed his next destination, though United are among several clubs reportedly keen.",
      "Spanish publication Cadena SER made the initial claim, though ESPN have subsequently suggested the Premier League giants aren't actively pursuing the centre-back. If Ramos were to make his maiden voyage to the Premier League, it would represent a decade-long pursuit finally coming to fruition.",
      "He featured prominently on Van Gaal's shopping list when the Dutchman took charge at Old Trafford in 2014. He had plans to partner Ramos alongside former Germany international Mats Hummels, who was shining in his first stint with Borussia Dortmund at the time.",
      "Discussing the players who got away during his United tenure, Van Gaal told FourFourTwo: \"I wanted [Robert] Lewandowski, but when this proved difficult I tried to get Gonzalo Higuain instead. Before I had arrived, I also spoke with the board about Neymar. If you are at United, you have to think big.",
      "\"He was also interesting for the club in terms of selling shirts, and I wanted to have quick wingers. For that reason, I also tried to get Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez. Thomas Muller was on my wish list, too, and in central midfield I wanted N'Golo Kante.",
      "\"I even tried to sign James Milner, who was already quite old but very multi-functional and possessed leadership skills. For the defence, I wanted Ramos and Mats Hummels, because ours wasn't the strongest in building from the back.",
      "\"Those were my top targets, but we couldn't get any of them. I don't know why, because as the manager I wasn't involved in any negotiations. After I left, players like Mahrez and Kante ended up at Manchester City and Chelsea, while United couldn't get them. I found that very odd.\"",
      "With the January transfer window approaching, Ruben Amorim may well be considering defensive reinforcements, particularly given the injury problems affecting Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt. The availability of the fit-again Lisandro Martinez also raises concerns as the Argentinian has managed just 61 Premier League outings since his 2022 arrival.",
      "Discussing potential squad additions, Amorim recently said: \"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United.",
      "\"We are not just buying one guy because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen. But of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and in January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "FIFA has set a release date of Monday, December 15 (today), for all clubs to release players for the tournament, which starts in Morocco on Sunday. This, however, has created a predicament for United, as their match against the Cherries is scheduled just five days before the tournament begins.",
      "United officials have been in discussion with the football federations of Cameroon, Morocco and the Ivory Coast regarding all three players in an attempt to secure an extension. The extension would allow them to participate in the Bournemouth match before jetting off to the tournament.",

Elsewhere, defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are out injured, while striker Benjamin Sesko remains a doubt due to food poisoning, despite having returned to first-team training after a knee injury.",

      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "\"We have two trainings still. The other two are out, Benjamin, we will assess.\"",

      "\"You sometimes think it will be solved during this week, but sometimes he feels a little bit of pain, and we have to be a little careful with that.\"",
      "Regarding those heading to AFCON, he added: \"I expect today [Friday] to have a decision or maybe tomorrow, but we are waiting until the last moment to have all the players available - to choose the best team to start the game.\"",

      "The final call-up was Amad, who has been included in the Ivory Coast squad for AFCON. As it stands, Amorim is unsure over whether any of the trio can play but their exits give him some selection headaches for the clash with Bournemouth.",

Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game nearly halfway through the season and is tipped to leave in the January transfer window, either on loan or permanently.",
      "Italian giants Napoli have been heavily linked with a move after failing with an approach in the summer, with the 10-time England international desperate for regular game time ahead of the World Cup. Mainoo also has just 18 months left on his current deal at Old Trafford, with talk of a new contract going quiet.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to use the midfielder, preferring Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his starting pair while often turning to Manuel Ugarte as Casemiro's replacement in the second half of matches. Mainoo's only start came in August, as United were beaten on penalties by Grimsby Town in the second round of the Carabao Cup.",
      "Now, though, the Red Devils boss has hinted that he could give the academy graduate a lifeline by playing an extra midfielder and dropping a forward. Ahead of United's clash with Bournemouth on Monday, Amorim was asked if he rated Mainoo, who's only started 16 of his 58 games in charge.",
      "\"Of course, like everyone else. The problem is we are playing with two [in midfield] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing,\" the Portuguese boss replied.",

      "Amorim went on to say: \"The door is open for any player to change my mind. But in the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year.",
      "\"I just look at the team and try to win the next game. I will do that until the end. Kobbs is one more player that I understand all the interests. I understand how important it is. The hopes that you guys and English guys have. I also just want to win. If he's the right guy, I will put him in. No problem.\"",
      "The United manager was asked a total of seven questions about Mainoo during his press conference, most notably adding that he's willing to sit down and discuss a January exit.",
      "\"First of all, the team comes first. If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody. But again, the focus is on this game. We will see if that happens.\"",

      "After a dismal previous campaign, Amorim began his first full season in charge at Old Trafford in a lacklustre fashion. But any doubts have since subsided and his team now finds themselves near the summit of the table.",
      "United could climb into the top six with a win on Monday evening, but despite languishing in 14th place, Andoni Iraola's Cherries will be no pushovers. Amorim could be without some key names for the fixture and one who certainly won't feature is Harry Maguire.",
      "The sidelined Maguire has found gametime tough to come by under Amorim this season starting just four top-flight matches. Reflecting to discovery+, he stated that one of his former coaches, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, was underappreciated during his time as United boss.",
      "\"Ole was brilliant, I think Ole was so underappreciated,\" Maguire said. \"He never got the recognition for what he was doing. It felt like, again, it was at Manchester United. If he was doing it at any other club he would have had recognition.",
      "\"It felt like everyone was waiting for the moment to kick him down, and he never allowed it. He was a real good manager. He had real good staff around him with Kieran [McKenna] and [Michael] Carrick, a fantastic man-manager, he knew how to look after his team and his players.",
      "\"It felt like he never really got the recognition and it was a shame really. Ultimately that third season we didn't do enough, the balance of the team wasn't what we had the previous two years, but I can't speak highly enough of Ole.\"",
      "Ahead of Bournemouth's clash with United, Cherries boss Iraola has singled out two potential opponents who could give his side a hard time. He said: \"Players like Amad, who is now even more important.",
      "\"He is an even bigger threat, and we have to be ready to defend difficult duels for the full-backs and for the centre-backs because you have to defend some very good players in open spaces.",
      "\"Mason Mount is a very smart player,\" he added. \"He always takes up good positions. I think he understands and analyses the game really well, to take up spaces on the pitch that he can exploit better.",
      "\"Sometimes he plays higher, sometimes lower, sometimes wider, sometimes inside, and obviously, there is a reason he does that. Then he is also a lovely player on the ball if we allow him a lot of time.\"",
      "Danish international Patrick Dorgu has often been used by Amorim as his left-sided wing-back, but his minutes have been reduced in recent games, with Diogo Dalot being preferred.",
      "The 21-year-old could make an appearance against Bournemouth, either from the start or off the bench, though he will have to be careful not to pick up a yellow card.",
      "Already this season, Dorgu has been booked in Premier League matches against Arsenal, Brentford, Brighton and Tottenham. If he is to pick up a fifth before the 20th game of the campaign then he will be suspended for one match.",
      "As per The FA's disciplinary rules, a player who picks up five yellow cards in the first 19 matches of a season will face a one-match suspension. Suspensions do not carry over to the EFL Cup or the FA Cup, and must be served in the Premier League.",
      "It is not just Dorgu who runs the risk of a ban on Monday evening either. Midfielder Casemiro is also walking a tightrope, having picked up four yellow cards as well.",
      "Amorim is opting to keep his cards close to his chest when it comes to the trio of Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui. The trio are set to head to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "But whether they'd leave before or after this evening's fixture has remained unclear. And it's set to stay that way until nearer kick-off, with United leaving their opponents to guess on their availability.",

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich believes Senne Lammens has already shown he's not at risk of running into the same problems as predecessor Andre Onana. Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day, all but ending Onana's United career - even if he hasn't given up on one day returning - and the Cameroon international moved on loan to Trabzonspor just a few days later.",
      "Bosnich had two spells at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson before losing his place to Fabien Barthez and also witnessed Massimo Taibi struggle after joining United from Venezia. Onana made a similar switch to Taibi, excelling in Serie A but finding things tougher at Old Trafford with some impressive displays overshadowed by a number of high-profile errors.",
      "\"Onana was excellent at Inter. They had just got to the Champions League final with Inter. They might have won it if Romelu Lukaku had taken that chance for an equaliser late on,\" Bosnich told The Mail.",
      "\"But he also had brilliant defenders in front of him there. He was very, very well protected. And then he came to United and he didn’t have that situation in front of him and he wasn’t as well protected and you have the combative style of the Premier League and Onana struggled to assert himself.",
      "\"I don’t see Lammens having those problems. He’s only 23 but he’s already proved he can deal with whatever’s thrown at him. He’s very, very good with his feet. He reminds me a bit of Thibault Courtois, who’s Belgian as well, of course. \"He has settled in very quickly. He’s young but I think United have got their long-term keeper now.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim sympathised with Onana after the keeper's struggles last season, but insisted the time was right to make a change. “We saw Andre had a very, very good season at Inter. The quality is there. But we are in the club and sometimes, in the moment, things can get harder and harder,\" he said after deciding to move for a new No.1.",
      "“You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail. I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it’s hard to point why. It’s the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",
      "Lammens was eased into the starting XI, with Amorim leaving the Belgian on the bench for three games before bringing him into the line-up in place of Altay Bayindir. While he has only recorded one clean sheet, his assuredness between the sticks has won him plaudits.",
      "The 23-year-old is expected to continue in goal on Monday when United face Bournemouth in the Premier League. Results elsewhere over the weekend mean three points at Old Trafford will take them fifth - with goal difference meaning they'd need to win by eight clear goals to overtake fourth-placed Chelsea.",

      "Carlos Baleba has spoken out about claims that transfer speculation linking him with Manchester United has affected his performances this season. The Brighton midfielder was reportedly the subject of a £100million bid from Old Trafford during the summer window, following his impressive displays for Fabian Hurzeler's team in 2024/25.",
      "United ultimately didn't pursue the deal and Baleba remained at the Amex Stadium. Since the transfer window closed, the Cameroon international has featured in 15 matches for the Seagulls.",
      "Whilst Baleba has been a regular fixture in Brighton's starting XI, he hasn't quite reached the heights of his previous form this term. This has prompted some observers, including Brighton fans, to wonder whether the transfer rumours have had a knock-on effect on his displays in a Seagulls jersey this season.",
      "\"Every day I try to work hard and get back to my level. Did I put too much pressure on myself? Yes, I think so, but I think it's good. It's good for me, because now I have to get through this slightly stressful period, get back on the horse and continue working hard.\"",
      "Despite a season of fluctuating form, Baleba is once again rumoured to be on United's radar for a January transfer as they aim to bolster their midfield. The Reds were keen to strengthen this area during the summer but failed to do so, leaving head coach Ruben Amorim with the same options.",
      "In a further boost for United and Amorim, it's understood that Baleba would prefer a move to Old Trafford over Bayern Munich. The German champions are also said to be considering a bid for the Cameroonian midfielder amidst doubts over Leon Goretzka's future.",
      "Alongside Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is another player on United's wish list, although several Premier League competitors are also keeping tabs on the former Blackburn Rovers midfielder. Elliot Anderson has also been identified as a potential target for Amorim's side, however, Nottingham Forest are expected to rebuff any attempts to sign the England international in January.",
      "If United don't manage to secure the signatures of one or two midfielders in the coming month, it could affect Kobbie Mainoo's chances of a January departure. The 20-year-old is eager for more playing time and is considering leaving United, with Napoli showing interest. However, the Reds are not keen on selling and would rather arrange a loan deal.",

      "Manchester United seem to have dropped a major hint that Bryan Mbeumo will be available for Monday's clash with Bournemouth. The Cameroon star was featured in training photographs with his teammates ahead of the match despite uncertainty around his involvement.",
      "United have kept quiet about the availability of Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui as they gear up to face the Cherries at Old Trafford. The trio are due to jet off to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) next week, but doubt remains over whether they'll take to the pitch against Andoni Iraola's side.",
      "FIFA established Monday, December 15, as the release date for clubs to free up players for the tournament, which kicks off on Saturday, December 21, but this created complications for United as their match with the Cherries falls on Monday.",
      "It's believed that United officials have been in discussions with the football associations of Cameroon, Ivory Coast, and Morocco regarding all three players in an attempt to negotiate an extension and enable them to play against Bournemouth before departing for the AFCON.",
      "However, United now appear to have given the strongest indication yet that Mbeumo, specifically, will line up against Bournemouth. United shared a photograph of Mbeumo in training on Instagram on Sunday morning.",
      "Accompanying three images of Mbeumo grinning during training with his teammates, United wrote in a caption: \"BM19 [beaming face with smiling eyes emoji, white love heart emoji].\"",
      "Supporters rushed to the comments section to share their predictions about Mbeumo's performance against Bournemouth, should he turn out for United on Monday. One supporter said: \"Goal and assists tomorrow [fire emoji].\"",
      "Another posted: \"Last dance for Mbeumo and Amad [raised hands emoji].\"",
      "A third commented: \"Sign off with goals tomorrow, before going for the AFCON.\"",
      "A fourth chimed in: \"Mbeumo to score a hat-trick tomorrow.\"",
      "Speaking ahead of the Bournemouth clash, United boss Ruben Amorim revealed discussions are ongoing regarding Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui: \"We are still in conversations with national team, the games in Monday, they are training and we are trying to prepare all scenarios.",
      "\"It's frustrating but at the same time nobody knows who is going to play, so it's a good thing. We have players to cope with everything. With a long week you can work on several stuff to prepare the game.\"",
      "Amorim suggested on Friday that United could exploit the uncertainty to their benefit, stating: \"Every national team has their ideas about when they want the players. I expect today [Friday] or maybe tomorrow [Saturday] to have a decision but we are waiting until the last moment to choose the best team.\"",
      "Victory against Bournemouth would lift United into fifth place in the Premier League standings. The Red Devils, who thrashed Wolves 4-1 in their previous outing, have suffered just one loss in their last nine league matches.",

      "At this time of the year, it is always nice to see a smiling face and you can normally be guaranteed one when Ruben Amorim walks into the room. Whatever you think about his 13 months in charge of Manchester United, it cannot be denied he has been a charming addition to the Premier League’s managerial ranks.",
      "And he has had to put up with a lot of critical flak, some of which has strayed into ridicule territory. His record has warranted close scrutiny because it has not been brilliant, winning only 23 of his 58 matches as United manager.",
      "But it has not warranted some of the mockery that has gone his way. Yet still, he almost always remains pleasant, polite and eminently cheerful. No snarling, no sarcasm, no snideness. He is a nice guy.",
      "But after the last Premier League game at Old Trafford - when West Ham United grabbed a late equaliser - Amorim was probably as angry as the regulars in the Old Trafford media theatre have seen him. He was not throwing things around but he was quietly seething.",
      "As an illustration, he did not take kindly to a question about him not trusting the United academy - and Amorim usually takes kindly to all questions, no matter how challenging. But he was seething for a reason. United had blown the chance to erase some of the pain inflicted by 10-man Everton recently and they had blown the chance to begin December with a statement win.",
      "Rightly, and admirably, Amorim has been supported by the Old Trafford hierarchy, despite regular attacks from pundits, including some very high-profile ex-United players.",
      "Only a few days ago, Paul Scholes said: “I don’t think the manager gets this club, full stop. I just don’t think he’s the right man.”",
      "There will be no excuses if United are not, with regard to a top-four place, in a strong position by mid-January. Injuries will not be an excuse, losing players to the Africa Cup of Nations will not be an excuse.",
      "Amorim admitted as much in his press conference ahead of Monday night’s game against Bournemouth, saying: “We have players to cope with everything. With a long week, you can see a lot of things and work on stuff to prepare for any situation.”",
      "After Bournemouth, United travel to Aston Villa, before home games against Newcastle United and Wolves are followed by trips to Leeds United and Burnley. Villa will clearly be tough but United will be facing a team that will have played six more matches this season. That should be significant.",
      "This United team should be one of the freshest in the country over this festive period. In Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui, they will miss important players but Amorim has plenty of cover.",
      "And even though it was against a team that is comfortably the worst in the division, Monday’s thumping of Wolves will give them momentum. It is not a make-or-break festive fixture period for Amorim but if he does not give United a happy Christmas, then it will finally be time to ask some serious questions.",

It is also expected to be the final movie of the saga, which initially launched back in 2001 and starred Vin Diesel, alongside Michelle Rodriguez and the late Paul Walker.",
      "The street racing series is set to launch the next instalment in 2026, despite recent delays, and movie lovers could see Ronaldo play a part, if Vin Diesel's claims are true. It comes as Ronaldo has already announced that he will be dipping into the world of cinematography earlier this year.",
      "Back in April, the 40-year-old revealed that he had launched his very own film studio alongside British film producer and director, Matthew Vaughn. A statement on his X account at the time read: \"Cristiano Ronaldo loves movies; Matthew Vaughn loves sport - and they both love a good story.",

      "Mohamed Salah overtook Wayne Rooney's single-club goal involvements record during Saturday's clash between Liverpool and Brighton and Hove Albion. The Egyptian started on the bench for the match for a fourth consecutive Premier League outing, after falling out of favour under Arne Slot.",
      "However, midway through the first-half, the 33-year-old was called upon to replace a struggling Joe Gomez, as Liverpool fans inside of Anfield greeted him with an ovation. Already 1-0 up at the time thanks to Hugo Ekitike's first-minute opener, Salah assisted the Frenchman for his brace in the second-half to take his total number of single-club goal involvements in the Premier League to 277 (broken down into 188 goals and 89 assists).",
      "The assist also saw him cruise past Rooney's longstanding record of 276 goal involvements, made up of 183 goals and 93 assists during his stint with Manchester United. However, he still remains third on the list in terms of multi-club goal involvements, with Alan Shearer's 324 and Rooney's 311 total at United and Everton still a way off.",
      "It comes as Liverpool fans made their feelings clear on Salah's current situation crystal clear on Saturday afternoon. The Egyptian unleased a scathing assessment of his relationship with Slot in the wake of the Reds' 3-3 draw with Leeds United last weekend.",
      "Tensions were already high ahead of kick-off, given the fact that it came as the third consecutive Premier League match that Salah had been demoted to the bench for. And in the aftermath of the match, Salah told reporters of his frustrations as he pulled no punches.",
      "He said: \"I don't know what to say. It's kind of funny, I couldn't believe it. It's a disappointing result for us as a team. We conceded silly goals. I could not help my team-mates because I am on the bench. I could not believe I was sitting on the bench for 90 minutes.",
      "\"That's the third time. It's the first time in my career I think. I am very disappointed, I have done so much for this club over years, especially last season, It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.",
      "\"That's how I feel it. Someone wants me to get all the blame. The club promised me a lot in summer. Now, I'm on bench, so I can say they haven't kept those promises.",
      "\"I used to have a good relationship [with Slot]. Now we don't have any relationship and I don't know why. [It] seems like someone does not want me in the club.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Salah also hinted that the Brighton match could be his last game as a Liverpool player, despite only signing a contract extension with the club earlier this year. He added: \"I called my mum and dad and told them to come to the Brighton game.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if I play or not. I'm going to enjoy it. I am just going to be at Anfield and say goodbye to the fans before the Africa Cup of Nations, because I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"It's not acceptable to me to be fair. If I was somewhere else, every club would protect its players. Now it's, 'Throw Mo under the bus because he is a problem in a team'. I don't think I am a problem.",
      "\"I am not fighting for my position every day because I have earned it. I am not bigger than the club. I am not bigger than anything. But I have earned it.\"",
      "Salah is now set to team-up with his national team-mates to take part in AFCON, which runs until mid January. And with the January transfer window right around the corner, it is unknown whether or not the forward, who has dedicated the last eight years of his career to Merseyside, will remain with the club come February 1.",

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reportedly in talks to outsource the club's catering. The Red Devils unveiled their first-quarter financial results on Thursday, which showed an operating profit of £13.3million.",
      "The latest figures show a significant improvement from the £6.9m loss recorded in the same period last year due to reduced costs. United's minority owner, Ratcliffe, has been trying to save money since taking control of football operations in February 2024.",
      "The Ineos founder has been open in his belief that United must drastically reduce expenditure and has made around 450 staff redundancies since taking over. The petrochemicals billionaire has also taken away staff benefits and increased ticket prices at Old Trafford.",
      "And The Sun now report that Ratcliffe has asked bosses to find a company that the M16 club can pay to provide all food and drink from hospitality rooms to stadium kiosks in the hope of saving more money.",
      "It is said that a potential deal could lead to a menu overhaul, with prawn sandwiches potentially being axed. The club are reportedly in talks with Levy, a subsidiary of Compass Group, regarding a multi-million-pound contract that would see the two businesses enter into a profit-sharing agreement.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "However, some catering staff are reportedly concerned that the deal could result in further redundancies.",
      "\"The catering staff are concerned that any potential change could see them lose their jobs,\" a source said.",
      "\"The club have been at pains to explain that by law, any outsourcing deal has to guarantee them their jobs, but some take great pride in being employed by Manchester United. It's a worrying time for them.\"",
      "A club source said: \"This is not about job cuts. It's about deciding what is the best catering model for the club, and ultimately for fans.",
      "\"We're one of only two clubs in the Premier League that don't currently outsource catering, so it makes sense for us to explore the option.\"",
      "Former Red Devils captain Roy Keane famously labelled some supporters who enjoy the club’s hospitality boxes as the 'prawn sandwich brigade' during a rant in November 2000. His comments came after the fans failed to support the team in a Champions League fixture against Dynamo Kviv.",
      "He said: \"Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans.",
      "\"But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch.\"",

      "Manchester United's notorious hierarchy boasted one of the most fearsome reputations the Premier League has ever witnessed. Sir Alex Ferguson commanded the club for nearly three decades, and his iron-fisted approach to management was legendary.",
      "Upset Fergie and you might find yourself permanently benched. The results spoke volumes, with an incredible 38 major trophies secured under his leadership.",
      "Yet Dimitar Berbatov has revealed that standards weren't applied equally behind the scenes at Old Trafford. The Bulgarian striker has previously shared that four United stars enjoyed \"special treatment\" from the Scot, something every player in the changing room could see.",
      "Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo were all singled out by the former United forward as players Ferguson trusted implicitly to deliver when it mattered most.",
      "Speaking to the Mirror in 2022, Berbatov said: \"The hierarchy in football, it's always there with the players. It doesn't matter when anyone tells you. When you are a star in a football team and you deserve to be one, of course, from time to time you will have special treatment from the manager.",
      "\"I remember Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville when we used to train, they trained a bit differently so they could save themselves for the games, and there is nothing wrong with that. This is normal in football.",
      "\"So it was the same with Cristiano Ronaldo, and in the end, we saw the results.\"",
      "Despite this favouritism being apparent to the rest of the squad, Berbatov maintained that it never created any divisions. He added: \"When you are a great football player sometimes the manager is going to give you more special attention. As long as you help the team win the game, this is normal in football.",
      "\"Sir Alex was very good at making a point to speak to everyone individually, so you didn't feel left out. Even if you didn't play he would know how to speak with you.\"",
      "The special attention these four legends received clearly delivered remarkable results, as they collectively secured 88 major trophies during Ferguson's reign at United. Neville dedicated his entire playing career to Old Trafford and earned his place in the Premier League Hall of Fame.",
      "Apart from two brief outings for his son's side, Royton Town, in 2018, Scholes remained loyal to United throughout his career and frequently features in discussions about the Premier League's greatest ever midfielder. Giggs devoted his entire playing days to Manchester and claimed more Premier League titles than any other player in the competition's history.",
      "Ronaldo's reputation precedes him, having evolved into arguably one of football's most exceptional talents of all time. Ferguson's preferential approach towards these four United icons undoubtedly delivered extraordinary returns for both their individual careers and the club's overall achievements.",

      "There, he has proved himself a useful squad member under Flick, netting six goals to date, with four of those strikes coming in the Champions League. His time on the pitch has diminished in recent weeks as other first-team regulars have returned from injury, but Rashford's response to this has impressed his boss.",
      "Rashford's attitude was frequently questioned at his boyhood club, United, particularly by Amorim, who raised concerns about the England star's commitment in training. He was also benched by Flick after turning up late to a September team meeting.",
      "However, Flick now has nothing but admiration for Rashford regarding how he has accepted a reduced role. It has been Brazilian star Raphinha who has effectively replaced him in the starting line-up after recovering from a hamstring problem, with Robert Lewandowski the preferred option up front.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Flick said: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected and the last time I checked with him he replied to me, 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions. The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important.'",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I am so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad,\" he continued.",
      "\"What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",
      "Rashford himself opened up last week about his loan spell at Barcelona. The 28-year-old was enthusiastic about his time with the Spanish giants so far.",
      "He said: \"I don't see anything here as like a pressure. It's just, I'm here to play football,\" and \"It's been amazing. I feel welcome, I feel at home.",

      "Manchester United chief Collette Roche has revealed that the club are closing in on a 'milestone' moment in plans to redevelop Old Trafford. United unveiled scale models and images of what their new stadium, which is expected to cost £2billion, will look like at a London event earlier this year.",
      "But a number of issues have arisen during the development phase and have led to delays. Now, though, Roche is confident that the new year will mark the next phase of the project, with the launch of a Mayoral Development Corporation set to take place in January.",
      "\"We're currently in several conversations with local landowners to make sure we can secure the best piece of land that we wanna put this stadium on that will hopefully be there for over 100 years. And in the background, we're doing a lot of work with the local authorities to make that happen.",
      "\"They're gonna launch Mayoral Development Corporation, formally, in January and I think that will be a good sort of milestone if you like, in terms of the wider regeneration. We're really, really ambitious, a lot of work is happening - albeit behind the scenes - and hopefully soon we'll be able to come forward with some bigger news.\"",
      "One hurdle that United must overcome is with Freightliner, which owns the railway depot that surrounds Old Trafford. Securing that portion of the site remains vital to the project, with club sources said to be confident that an agreement will be reached.",
      "In February, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggested that the stadium could be open as soon as 2030. No Government money will be put towards the stadium itself, although they're backing the regeneration project in the Trafford area.",
      "Speaking on The Added Time podcast, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: \"It's not about giving them money because we have a really clear principle here at the start of this journey with the Mayoral Development Corporation.",
      "\"Manchester United will be paying for the stadium. There will not be a penny of public money going into that.",
      "Do you like the proposed design? Let us know your opinion in the comments section.",
      "\"But we have absolutely a role to play in making everything around the stadium as good as it can be because of the economic benefit that brings. If you think about it, there is a train station behind the stand there and it's not been used for a number of years for safety reasons.",
      "\"Part of it would see that station relocated a little bit, maybe a bit nearer Lou Macari's chippy or somewhere near there, and that would then reopen and massively benefit existing communities; Gorst Hill, Stretford and the people who live there, so the public benefit of this would be massive.",

      "Negotiations with the stars' respective national teams have been ongoing for weeks but the outcome up to now has been unknown. Amorim attempted to twist this into a positive by suggesting it will also keep Andoni Iraola guessing but undoubtedly it will be frustrating for United to be in the dark.",
      "So with little known as to the availability of the trio, our best guess is that the three men remain with United for this game before jetting off for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). If this is the case, Mazraoui is likely to keep his place on the left side of the back three to allow Leny Yoro a further rest from the start.",
      "Ayden Heaven has been trusted to start the last two games and there is no evidence to suggest Amorim will change his mind on that approach tonight. Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire's absences will be felt hard",
      "As the club's best wing-back, Amad will keep his place in the starting XI with Diogo Dalot likely to keep the left wing-back role after scoring against West Ham and being unlucky not to add to his tally vs Bournemouth. Patrick Dorgu's chance should come once Amad leaves for AFCON and Dalot is moved to right wing-back.",
      "Having Mbeumo available would be ideal for United and including him in the starting line-up takes some pressure off the stretched attack. Benjamin Sesko is back to full fitness but a bout of food poisoning has put his place in the team in doubt.",
      "Sesko's absence since the draw at Tottenham should mean Amorim starts the striker on the bench particularly with other options available to him. Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are both capable of playing as false nines if required and this should allow the Slovenian to be eased back into first-team football.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has hit back at suggestions he's reluctant to use to club's academy talents by highlighting several stars' recent struggles. The Portuguese head coach name-dropped Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Amass, Toby Collyer and Chido Obi, all of whom have been given an opportunity to impress under his leadership.",
      "Mainoo has gone from starting for England in the European Championship final and playing a key role in United's starting XI under Erik ten Hag to the wilderness under Amorim. The England international has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford and asked to leave the club in the summer.",
      "The 20-year-old has not been able to agree a new contract with United and is being linked with a loan move away from the club in January.",
      "Amorim was asked what a loan move for Mainoo would mean for his gametime before speaking about the other three academy talents.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference ahead of the clash with Bournemouth, Amorim suggested Amass, Chido and Collyer had been promoted to the first team squad too early.",
      "Amorim said: \"He (Collyer) played (for the United first team). He’s from the academy. He played here. He went to West Bromwich. He’s not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it’s not because he’s from the academy or whatever.",
      "\"It’s the situation, what’s happened. I don’t know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let’s see after this match.",
      "\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in under 21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Midfielder Collyer made his debut for United under Ten Hag and actually started ahead of Casemiro under Amorim in the 2-0 Europa League win at Steaua Bucharest in January, but went on loan to West Brom in the summer.",
      "Obi and Amass were given their debuts by Amorim earlier this year, though the former has spent the majority of his time with the Under-21s, while Amass is on loan with Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "It's understood that Amorim's comments regarding Amass referred to Wednesday's position at the foot of the table and recent points deduction, rather than a reflection of the United loanee's performances, having started all 15 of the games he's been available for.",
      "However, Obi, who made eight appearances for United last season, has five goals in ten U21s games this season and has not scored for the second string since October, with a loan move potentially in the offing come January.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim knew this winter would be a test of his squad through no fault of his own. The Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) always provides a challenge for Premier League clubs as they see a handful of their players venture to the continent for the major international tournament.",
      "United are no exception with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo's nations all qualifying for AFCON, meaning they will miss the festive period at the very least. What has not helped either is the scheduling for the Reds causing confusion over the trio's availability.",
      "FIFA have set a deadline of Monday, December 15 for clubs to release their players for the tournament. However, United have been in negotiations with Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon respectively to try and extend this so they can all feature against Bournemouth on Monday night. The outcome of these talks is still unknown.",
      "Amorim has attempted to spin this into a positive with the United manager stating on Friday: \"It's frustrating, but at the same time, nobody knows who is going to play, so it's a good thing. We have players to cope with everything. With a long week, you can see a lot of things and work on stuff to prepare for any situation.\"",
      "While we do not know if the African trio will be involved against the Cherries, we do know they eventually will be absent and this means a golden opportunity presents itself for three players to give Amorim something to think about heading into 2026.",
      "First up is Ayden Heaven. When the centre-back joined United in January, he was fresh off the back of his only senior appearance for Arsenal. He arrived with the expectation of receiving more first-team chances and this has proven to be the case. Heaven has racked up 11 appearances since moving to Old Trafford and has been thrust into the limelight recently due to defensive shortages.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are both missing with injuries and once Mazraoui leaves, Heaven will be needed to fill in. It goes to show how difficult the patch of form for Leny Yoro has been that Heaven has been asked to anchor the centre of the back three in recent matches.",
      "Yoro will eventually become a first-team regular again and this break from the starting line-up will have done him some good. But for Heaven, he has a chance this winter to show Amorim he is ready to be called upon regularly in defence - particularly if Maguire ends up leaving at the end of the season.",
      "Staying in defence, another player due to benefit from the AFCON call-ups is Patrick Dorgu. The Dane has been sharing the left wing-back responsibilities with Diogo Dalot this campaign but in recent weeks it has been the Portuguese international who has nailed the position down.",
      "With Amad heading to AFCON, the natural decision would be to move Dalot back to his preferred right wing-back role and bring Dorgu into the team on the left. If you are Dorgu, you have to see this as a massive opportunity.",
      "Amad is more than likely to regain his spot in the starting XI once he returns and then the question lies as to who remains on the left. If Dorgu can start to harness some of his undoubted potential, Amorim will find it difficult to drop him to allow Dalot to move back over.",
      "Moving further forward, Matheus Cunha is the final player hoping to make his mark during AFCON. It has been a mixed start to life in Manchester for Cunha. His combinations with the likes of Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko this campaign have been good but the statistics paint a disappointing picture.",
      "Just the one goal and one assist to his name from 13 matches will be frustrating for the Brazilian as well as his manager. But, with Mbeumo gone, United need someone to step up to the plate and become the Reds' main man.",
      "Cunha is set up perfectly to do just that. Amorim will likely call upon the 26-year-old to lead the line as well as playing in the No.10 role when Sesko is back to full sharpness.",
      "With all eyes on him, it will be up to Cunha to boost those numbers over the festive period and become United's main man while Mbeumo is away.",

      "With European qualification firmly in their sights, there's plenty of speculation about whether United will look to bolster their squad or stick with their current squad when the January transfer window rolls around.",
      "Names like Sunderland midfielder Noah Sadiki, Atletico Madrid and England star Conor Gallagher, AZ Alkmaar's Kees Smit and Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo are just some of those rumoured to be on United's mid-season shopping list.",
      "Meanwhile, there's been no shortage of chatter about possible departures from Old Trafford, with particular attention being paid to Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Follow below for all the latest Man United updates, reactions, analysis and opinions throughout the day...",
      "United are said to hold a genuine interest in Maxi Araujo.",
      "TEAMtalk claim the Uruguay international is one of their top options as they work on signing a left wing-back. United reportedly had scouts watching Araujo play for Sporting CP against AVS on Saturday, after regularly watching the 25-year-old this year.",
      "Latest reports in Italy claim that United may be open to a January sale of Joshua Zirkzee, but only in the second half of the transfer window when players on duty in the Africa Cup of Nations return.",
      "Calciomercato report that Roma are ‘stepping up the pressure’ and that the club have the ‘green light’ to start negotiations. It’s claimed that a loan deal with a €35 million (£31m) option to buy is being discussed.",
      "The report, however, comes not long after it was reported that the striker is determined to remain at Old Trafford and battle for his place in the team. The absence of Mbeumo during the Africa Cup of Nations could give him the opportunity to do so.",
      "Read more here",
      "United are showing ‘more and more’ interest in Ecuadorian midfielder Ederson Castillo, according to journalist Johanna Calderon. On a video on DeUnaSF, she outlined United’s growing interest in the young player.",
      "The 17-year-old is likely to be one for the future if a deal is completed, with the teenager impressing with Liga Deportiva Universitaria. United are, however, said to face competition from several other clubs.",
      "There is not long until the January transfer window opens for Manchester United, with work likely to be going on in the background in preparation for the window.",
      "Rumours about potential comings and goings at Old Trafford are already swirling as Ruben Amorim looks to continue to shape his squad in his first full season at the club.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United's clash with Bournemouth on Monday night could see 10 players missing due to injury, suspension, or unavailability due to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "The Reds are aiming to keep the availability of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo under wraps ahead of Monday's game at Old Trafford. All three are set to depart for AFCON early next week.",
      "FIFA has set a release date of Monday, December 15, for clubs to release players for the tournament, which kicks off on Saturday, December 21. This, however, has created a predicament for United due to their match against the Cherries being scheduled for Monday evening.",
      "Read more here",
      "Carlos Baleba has addressed talk that speculation over a potential move to Manchester United has impacted his form this season. The Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder was linked with a £100million switch to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, after impressing for Fabian Hurzeler's side in 2024/25.",
      "However, United didn't end up signing him and Baleba stayed at the Amex Stadium. Since the window slammed shut, the Cameroon international has made 15 appearances for the Seagulls. While Baleba has been an almost ever-present in the Brighton XI, he hasn't been at his best this season.",
      "Indeed, that has led to some, including Brighton supporters, question whether the transfer speculation has influenced his form in a Seagulls shirt this season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Ruben Amorim said he had no problem with taking criticism from former Manchester United players in the media and accepted the fact that he is underperforming meant much of it was warranted. There has been conflict between former club greats and the current crop of players, as well as recent managers, in the last few years over some heavy-handed criticism from the comfort of TV studios and podcast booths.",

      "Club officials have been in discussions with the football federations of Cameroon, Morocco, and the Ivory Coast regarding all three players in an attempt to secure an extension. The extension would allow them to participate in the Bournemouth match before jetting off to the tournament.",

      "According to CaughtOffside, United chiefs are 'increasingly open' to selling club captain Bruno Fernandes in the near future.",
      "He may have the most combined goals and assists of any player at the club this season, however at 31 years of age a lucrative sale would allow for reinvestment in potential transfer targets such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "The report suggests 'strong interest' will arrive from Saudi Arabia, in particular from Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad.",
      "Ruben Amorim labelled Antoine Semenyo a \"special player\" ahead of Manchester United's Premier League fixture with Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night. United showed an interest in the forward during the summer before making moves for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to strengthen their attack.",
      "Semenyo remained with the Cherries and enjoyed another strong start to the season, although his form has wavered in the past few weeks. The 25-year-old hasn't scored or assisted in any of his last seven games, although a return of six goals and three assists in 14 Premier League games is still impressive.",
      "The Ghana international, who will remain available for Bournemouth for the next month after his country failed to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), will be a threat to United tonight. Amorim spoke highly of Bournemouth, Semenyo, and their head coach, Andoni Iroala, despite their failure to win any of their last six games.",

      "Manchester United supporters have been taken aback after Ruben Amorim appeared to criticise the club's renowned academy system. The United boss has faced scrutiny for failing to give sufficient opportunities to homegrown talent during his challenging 13-month spell at Old Trafford.",
      "Just three youngsters - Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi - have made their debuts under the former Sporting CP manager, who regularly fielded academy graduates during his time at his previous club. However, Amorim has now implied that two of those three, along with Toby Collyer - who debuted under Erik ten Hag - were given first-team chances prematurely.",
      "Obi appeared in the senior squad last season but has predominantly trained with United's under-21s this campaign, whilst Amass has been featuring regularly since joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan. Meanwhile, Collyer is currently at United, rehabilitating from injury after making four appearances while on loan with Championship side West Bromwich Albion.",
      "Addressing the prospects of Kobbie Mainoo, United's standout academy product in recent seasons, Amorim proceeded to question the club's youth development programme. \"He (Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever.",
      "\"It's the situation, what's happened. I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\".",
      "Amorim appeared to be referring to Wednesday's difficulties rather than Amass' individual displays. The Championship side are keen to prolong the left-back's loan arrangement through to the end of the campaign.",
      "United supporters responded to the comments with outrage, with one writing on X: \"What is Amorim trying to achieve with those quotes about Mainoo and the academy? Honestly just self sabotage at this point.\"",
      "Another remarked: \"Slagging off our academy players to defend his stubbornness is a new low for Amorim.\"",
      "A third added: \"Ruben Amorim throwing the academy players under the bus, knowing full well the fundamentals of the club's history is built on the academy surely has to be the final straw for (Jason) Wilcox and INEOS. He's not the right man for the job and we must act before we lose more youth talents.\"",
      "United fans are also concerned that the club's impressive streak of including a homegrown player in every matchday squad for the past 88 years (over 4,300 matches) could be jeopardised under Amorim due to his perceived lack of faith.In November, midfielder Jack Fletcher was selected for United's away game against Tottenham, ensuring the record remained unbroken.",
      "\"There is something special in our club which has to be bullet proof. The way we behave, the way we feel [about] the club. We are not going to stop with academy players. It doesn't matter about the result.",
      "\"We will continue with these small details which are the foundations of our club. We have that record, we won't break that record. And Jack is ready to help us. We will show that our academy is our future. The players in our academy must be ready to help us.\"",

I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals.",

      "\"The problem is that we are playing with two and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing,\" he said. \"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, but with three, Kobbie will have more minutes.",
      "\"Imagine that this happens. Someone in front is going to lose their spot. Sometimes it's just the moment. Again, I think I proved that. If you change my mind, because Casemiro is I think the biggest example. He was behind Toby and now he's a star.",

      "He also insisted he didn't mind talking about Mainoo, despite a spiky press conference ahead of the win against Wolves when he seemed to object to being asked about him so often.",
      "Amorim also said that Mainoo could take Casemiro's position, but suggested that would only happen as a substitute and in certain circumstances, which is unlikely to offer too much hope to the midfielder.",
      "\"Yes, he can. Against West Ham was Manu [Ugarte] that comes for Bruno's position. Bruno goes up because I was feeling that with 10 minutes it's going to be long balls, second balls,\" he said.",
      "\"I was thinking that, I think it was against Everton. I took Casemiro out and I put Kobbie in that because we were trying to play a different game.",
      "\"He can play in that position. But it's hard sometimes. If you look at our team with Cunha, Bryan, sometimes Bruno, that you guys say is a No.10. Sometimes Kobbie, Manu, you have to think I'm the guy for blocking transitions, all these things. He needs to spend more time there but he can be in the future that position.\"",

Regarding the team news, Amorim is unsure about the availability of Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations call-ups, but Benjamin Sesko could return to the squad.",
      "Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt have both been ruled out of the clash due to injury. Here's how our writers think United should start...",
      "There is an element of kidology to United's approach to Mazraoui, Amad and Mbeumo, with the aim of keeping Bournemouth guessing as well. You have to imagine the latter two will be available, given they don't play until Christmas Eve, but Mazraoui's competition starts on Saturday, so he might be the one to watch.",
      "Let's presume all are available, in which case they all start. I would make a change in defence by bringing Yoro back in for Heaven. The latter did well at Wolves but Yoro needs to get back in and find his rhythm again as he will be called on when Mazraoui does depart.",
      "Dalot has done well at left wing-back recently, even though he is likely to move to the right when Amad goes to AFCON. For now, they can keep their places and the midfield picks itself. Sesko might be involved but a start feels a stretch given his bout of food poisoning and United have looked slick anyway playing without a striker this season.",
      "We've been left in the dark about whether Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui will be available, but the trio should start if they are given the green light to feature.",
      "Yoro should be recalled to the team. Heaven was great against Wolves, producing a pleasing response to his West Ham display, but Yoro should come back in after receiving a breather.",
      "United have looked their best when playing without a striker this season. Mount should start down the middle, although the attack would be fluid.",

      "Dalot endured a difficult start to the season and was the subject of criticism from supporters as his standards declined in the early months of the campaign. Amorim eventually felt he had to act and Dalot was dropped for the draw with Tottenham and the defeat to Everton in November.",
      "The 26-year-old was hurt by Amorim's decision to drop him, but was aware his performances hadn't been good enough. It might prove to be a defining moment in the season, sparking a revival in Dalot's performances and a change in his game as well.",
      "He has started the last three games, registering a goal and an assist, and it's been notable that his attacking threat has increased considerably. That is no surprise, given that it has become a major focus of a lot of Dalot's work at Carrington.",
      "The absence of European football this season has given Amorim and his coaches more time on the training ground and they have started some one-on-one focused work with Dalot, particularly aimed at improving his positioning in attacking areas down the left wing and getting him into the penalty area more often.",
      "That has been visible recently. His goal against West Ham came when he was in front of goal near the penalty spot. He teed up Bryan Mbeumo at Wolves with a run straight through the heart of the Wolves defence.",
      "Dalot has had 65 touches in the attacking third of the pitch in the games against Crystal Palace, West Ham and Wolves. His previous 10 appearances in the Premier League this season had produced 142 touches in the final third. There were also six touches in the opposition penalty area in the last three games, compared to 11 in the previous 10 games.",
      "That suggests the work on the training ground is paying off and that Dalot can start delivering a more attacking threat from his wing-back position. Much of that work has focused on his positioning on the left, playing as an inverted winger, but he could return to the right flank during the Africa Cup of Nations, when Amad is away with the Ivory Coast.",
      "Dalot has been a source of frustration for supporters this season. His role has changed under Amorim. While he has always been versatile in terms of which flank he plays on at United, he is now being asked to play more as a winger, especially in games where United are dominant, having been schooled as a full-back.",
      "That has required some adaptation, and Dalot has felt the criticism. As one source close to the player said, he is somebody \"that listens to and feels criticism,\" and people around him feel he has been getting \"hammered\" for quite some time. His response hasn't been to go into his shell, but double down on his routines to try and work his way out of a funk.",
      "His spell out of the team was never likely to last long. Dalot started 31 of Amorim's first 33 games in charge last season before a calf injury forced him into a spell on the sidelines.",
      "He is trusted by Amorim and his staff, as well as teammates. He has been at United since 2018 and is now considered a leader, particularly in helping academy players and new signings settle in and find their bearings.",
      "It was Dalot who recently lost his bearings, but there are signs that his best form might be returning and that he can deliver the attacking threat that Amorim wants from his wing-backs.",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has sent a heart-warming message to his son Aiden on his 21st birthday.",
      "Aiden has severe autism and is non-verbal, with Scholes recently sharing the challenges and rewards of caring for him. The ex-United and England footballer, now 51, took a step back from live TV work at the end of last season to spend more time with Aiden.",
      "Taking to social media platform Instagram on Monday, Scholes shared a picture of Aiden, along with the caption: \"Happy 21st birthday our special boy @aidenlukescholes... wish you knew how much we all love you xxx.\"",
      "The message prompted replies from former United teammates. Gary Neville, responded in the comments section with three red heart emojis, while Patrice Evra wrote \"Joyeux anniversaire\", which translates from French as Happy Birthday.",
      "Nicky Butt responded with two applause, two celebration and a red heart emoji. Scholes' ex-England teammate, John Terry, also replied with two blue heart emojis.",
      "The message comes after Scholes opened up about the difficulties of receiving the diagnosis for Aiden, when he was young. At the time, Scholes was playing for United.",
      "He told the Stick to Football podcast: \"He'd bite your arm or scratch you just out of frustration for him, 'cos he didn't understand things, couldn't tell you how he was feeling. I never got a break from it, even when playing.",
      "\"It was very hard in those days, and feels like it was years ago. I don't think (the doctors) diagnosed it until they were two-and-a-half years old.",
      "\"But you knew early something was wrong, but then you get the diagnosis, and I'd never heard of it. Then, all of a sudden you start seeing everything, I don't know if it just consciously happens, I don't know.\"",
      "Scholes also spoke about the decision he made not to tell anyone at the club. \"I just thought even if I did speak to someone about it, it's not going to help Aiden,\" he said.",
      "When asked if it would have helped him, he replied: \"I don't know what would help me.\"",
      "He has, however, now decided to take a step back. Scholes is instead involved in a podcast with Butt and Paddy McGuinness called The Good, The Bad & The Football.",
      "The decision to move away from live TV is so he can spend more time with his son. Scholes revealed: \"I do studio work, but everything is built around his day.",
      "\"Last season on Thursday nights I'd do the Europa League for Man Utd, that's the night I'd usually have him, so he was getting all agitated, biting and scratching.",
      "\"He knows the pattern's not there straightaway. And I did that for years really, always thinking I've got to stop this at some point so I had the chance to do the podcast and I thought that would suit me more, well not me, Aiden.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim labelled Antoine Semenyo a \"special player\" ahead of Manchester United's Premier League fixture with Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night. United showed an interest in the forward during the summer before making moves for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to strengthen their attack.",
      "Semenyo remained with the Cherries and enjoyed another strong start to the season, although his form has wavered in the past few weeks. The 25-year-old hasn't scored or assisted in any of his last seven games, although a return of six goals and three assists in 14 Premier League games is still impressive.",
      "The Ghana international, who will remain available for Bournemouth for the next month after his country failed to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), will be a threat to United tonight. Amorim spoke highly of Bournemouth, Semenyo, and their head coach, Andoni Iroala, despite their failure to win any of their last six games.",
      "The Cherries could also end up losing Semenyo in January, with the attacker understood to have a £65 million release clause in his contract for the winter window. Liverpool have been linked with a move for him next month. As much as Amorim likes the player, he denied his praise meant he wanted United to make a move for him.",
      "\"No, it's not the case. I think there is a lot of special players in the league,\" he said. \"What I feel is that it's to summarise the top manager, top team. I really like the team and the top player. I think he is a special player.\"",
      "Amorim will again be without Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire against Bournemouth, but even with central defenders injured, he has continued his policy of making changes from the bench in that position during games.",
      "A centre-back has come off the bench to replace another centre-back in 14 of United's 15 Premier League games this term, but Amorim insisted the circumstances were always different and that often it was fitness-related.",
      "\"Sometimes it's a little bit bad luck,\" he said. \"Ayden was suffering and asked us to change [at Wolves]. Nous had that knock and asked us. He was talking about that. Diogo is a defender not a centre-back. He had an issue.",
      "\"Most of the times, Harry Maguire sometimes has an issue. Sometimes it's that situation that occurs a lot of times. So sometimes it's a tactical issue because I believe that those are the guys that have to start all the plays and the quality comes from them, but a lot of times also we need to change because of the physical aspect.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim thought Manchester United had cracked it at Old Trafford. Four successive home wins in the Premier League was the best run of form there since the end of the 2022/23 season and hinted at brighter days ahead. Burnley, Chelsea, Sunderland and Brighton were seen off between the end of August and the end of October and a weight looked to be lifted.",
      "The atmosphere was excellent in those matches and it did look like something was building at Old Trafford. Amorim certainly felt it. After the fourth of those wins, when Brighton were beaten 4-2, he spoke about the atmosphere after Bryan Mbeumo had scored to put United 3-0 up just after the hour mark.",
      "\"I think, after the third goal, the noise of the stadium was not normal. It was like a different moment,\" he said. \"It was the first time that I felt that sound within the environment. So it was a very good moment for me. \"Of course, we are focusing on the game but there are something things in this club, in this stadium, that you feel. And that was really strange. The sound of the stadium was incredible.\"",
      "There was no reason to think that positivity would suddenly come to a halt. United went a month without playing at home, but when they returned against Everton, Amorim was confident of continuing that run of form. Before the match, he touched on how difficult it had been for United to play at Old Trafford in recent seasons and suggested he felt that those challenges might now be over.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "“That is the best thing, because in the recent past it was hard to play at home,\" he said. \"But nowadays you miss playing at home, that is a feeling we should have in our club. I’m really excited to be back playing at home and the players also. We need to continue winning at home.”",
      "Only United didn't continue winning at home. Home fixtures against Everton and West Ham should have produced six points rather than one and the manner of the defeat to 10-man Everton was particularly galling. It felt like all that positivity built up at Old Trafford had been eroded in one dismal 90-minute display.",
      "West Ham was little better. Amorim's side conceded a late equaliser but produced a flat attacking performance. While the atmosphere remains excellent at times, the players need to fulfil their end of the bargain, and the noise will never be sustained in games like that one.",
      "Now, United are back to the drawing board at home. Their record stands at four wins, two defeats and a draw and it leaves them 13th in the Premier League home table. Last season, they had the 14th-best home record in the league, and the season before that, the eighth-best. It's nowhere near good enough for what United want to achieve.",
      "Playing in the biggest club stadium in England should be an advantage that United can drive home, but the fear factor of Old Trafford has long since vanished. It is those wearing red who now find it tricky.",
      "Just look at Bournemouth for evidence of that. The Cherries have won two successive league fixtures at Old Trafford, both 3-0, which would have once felt unimaginable.",
      "Perhaps this month is an opportunity for the momentum to return. United have won only three of their last nine home games in the month of December but fixtures to finish the year against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Wolves should be seen as an opportunity.",
      "Three wins are clearly achievable, and with Aston Villa away sandwiched between those first two fixtures, a couple of victories might well be needed. Improving their home form is vital if United are to return to the Champions League and the festive period is an ideal chance to bring the cheer back to Old Trafford.",

Anti-Glazer fans have encouraged supporters not to buy official United merchandise, but the club have banked an increase of £3.7m from the same period last year.",
      "United announced their latest financial figures on Thursday afternoon. Club sources have said the increased retail and merchandise revenue is due to the impact of a full three months’ trading under their new ecommerce model, compared to only one month in the prior year quarter.",
      "However, the increase will not be received warmly by anti-Glazer fans, who have protested against the American family and encouraged others to hurt their pockets by boycotting merchandise.",

      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck a £24m per season deal in 2022. The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",

      "Discussions have taken place regarding the youngster's future, and United are willing to make concessions to allow Mather to leave as early as possible after his summer move collapsed.",
      "The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward. United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather's options for an exit were limited following the closure of the European transfer windows, which led to talks taking place with UAE club Al Wahda FC at the end of September.",
      "United insisted on including a buy-back clause during discussions to sell Mather, which is common practice for departures from the academy, but the UAE club did not agree.",
      "Mather was forced to deal with the disappointment of missing out on a fresh start. He has continued to train with the first-team and has made appearances in four academy fixtures to keep ticking over.",

The club shared heartwarming footage of the 56-year-old receiving a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season during his tour, a campaign in which he played a pivotal role in securing the domestic double.",
      "Known for his blistering pace and nimble footwork, Kanchelskis' lean, tall physique often gave defenders a lot to deal with during his time in the Premier League. Almost two decades after hanging up his boots, he still sports a full head of hair, albeit styled more slickly than the curtain hairstyle he wore during his playing days in Manchester.",
      "The skillful winger had a successful footballing career, representing both the Soviet Union and Russia internationally. He also played for Everton, Southampton, Rangers and Fiorentina.",
      "Kanchelskis is currently coaching Russian Second Division team Dynamo Bryansk. After retiring, he served as sporting director at First Division side FC Nosta Novotroitsk before transitioning into management with various teams across central Europe.",
      "Upon his return to Manchester, the ex-winger was gifted a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season and enjoyed a trip down memory lane as he toured the training facilities.",
      "The United icon will be using his trip to England to gather fresh insights and inspiration before his side's domestic campaign begins in March. Kanchelskis had an exceptional 1994/95 season with the Red Devils, during which he claimed the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "The attacker then made a surprising switch to Merseyside when Everton secured his signature for a club record £5million. Since then, he has maintained cult hero status at both clubs, a reflection of his exceptional ability on the pitch.",
      "Kanchelskis was accompanied by his son Andrei - a devoted Everton supporter - and also dropped by the Toffees' training complex this week. He met up with David Moyes and witnessed their victory against Nottingham Forest at the new ground.",
      "Reflecting on his time at Old Trafford, he said: \"Every name is a big name at Man United, it was an excellent time. I remember the big boss, Sir Alex Ferguson he helped me a lot. A lot of criticism for me also when I played bad crosses.",
      "\"He was always angry for me and Giggsy. But it was an excellent time and thank you very much Man United, it is still in my heart.\"",

      "Diego Leon's future is up in the air ahead of the January transfer window. Leon has exclusively played in Manchester United academy fixtures this season and staff have been pleased with his progress.",
      "That does not necessarily mean Leon will receive an appropriate loan offer in the January window. The youngster has played for the Under-21s and interest may be thin on the ground.",
      "Leon's representative, Renato Bittar, spoke in Paraguay about January, saying: \"We still don't have it clear if he's going to go out on loan now, we have to keep watching. He's evolving and that's positive.\"",
      "Bittar added that it “would not be ideal” to interrupt his current season with a move away.",
      "For Leon to leave in the winter window, a club would have to submit a convincing development plan with the promise of regular game time, which could be unlikely to arrive in the middle of the campaign.",
      "It's understood that coaches believe Leon has plenty to work on. Academy fixtures have helped Leon improve, while staying in the building would allow him to continue joining first-team training sessions.",
      "United unveiled Leon as a first-team signing alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in August. The defender was included in the United States pre-season tour squad in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has named Leon in matchday squads against Grimsby Town, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland this season, but he has not made his senior debut.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign the young defender.",
      "Before Leon travelled to Manchester, he spoke to local journalists at an airport in Paraguay, saying: “I’m going to kill it in the pre-season, and within one or two games, I’ll already be playing with them [first-team].\"",
      "The youngster's transfer made headlines in his homeland and Leon discussed the impact of his move.",
      "\"For Paraguay, to have a player playing here at United is huge,\" he told club media. \"I think for Paraguayans, they’re very proud to have someone from there playing in a club as big as Manchester United.",
      "\"It is an amazing, unique feeling to represent your country for all the people of Paraguay. I don’t know, it has no explanation - for my family it is an immense sense of pride to see me play with my national team.\"",

      "Gabriel started aged 15 years, two months and three days, which meant he broke the record previously held by United academy graduate Omari Forson (15 years and four months).",
      "The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "Gabriel recently trained with the first-team. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly-rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Amorim was given a closer look at the youngster when he took part in training. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You could see the Under-21s had a game and we had fewer players and tried to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is set to be hit particularly hard by the tournament's selection, with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both big losses. They'll link up with Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, respectively, while Noussair Mazraoui will represent hosts Morocco.",
      "The tournament hosts have made it to at least the semi-final stage of the past two AFCON competitions. This is worth bearing in mind given Morocco tend to be a perennial contender and enters their own competition as favourites this year.",
      "It's also worth highlighting that in addition to being absent for fixtures, those venturing deeper in the tournament won't return to club duty straight away. And any players that get their hands on the title may be entitled to a few extra days to lap up their achievement before coming back to England.",
      "Morocco are the clear frontrunners with the bookmakers to win a first AFCON crown since 1976, while seven-time champions Egypt are second in the stakes. The Atlas Lions are heavily backed to top Group A ahead of Zambia, Mali and Comoros, while Egypt appear to have a slightly harder line-up against South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe in Group B.",
      "The competition doesn't get underway until December 21, although players will start to link up with their sides imminently. The tournament will conclude in Rabat on January 18, meaning some players could be away for a full month.",
      "During that span, there are six rounds of Premier League action due to be played. This includes a particularly demanding three-week period between December 20 and January 8, across which each top-flight club will play five times.",
      "Some of those Premier League outfits missing players over the next month face more testing periods than others. At least on paper given the current table and how teams are performing at present.",
      "For example, Aston Villa will face United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Crystal Palace (in that order) between December 21 and January 7. Brighton also has a testing run of fixtures over the next month or so, with Sunderland, Arsenal, City and Bournemouth each on the agenda while the AFCON is on.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd are preparing a huge bid to sign Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils brought in over £200m worth of new signings last summer with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backing Ruben Amorim in the transfer market.",
      "Man Utd concentrated on new attacking signings, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all joining, as they were the fifth lowest scoring side in the Premier League last term as they finished 15th.",
      "However, by concentrating mainly on the attack, many fans and pundits think they made a major error by failing to sign a new midfielder.",
      "But transfer expert Fabrizio Romano recently insisted that Man Utd are now looking to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "Romano told his YouTube channel in November: “Ruben Amorim sends clear indications in public and in private for Manchester United in the January transfer window. In private, the conversations have started between Amorim, the board, and the management of Man Utd ahead of the January window.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim stands accused of ‘rampage’ as THREE kids ‘brutally’ attacked",
      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Man Utd are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "It’s unlikely Man Utd will be able to stretch their January transfer budget to meet the asking prices of reported targets like Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson or Carlos Baleba.",
      "Real Madrid midfielder Valverde is another midfielder who’d require a huge fee, more likely to be met in the summer, and reports in Spain claim that Man Utd ‘are prepared to offer a staggering €120m (£105m)’ to convince the La Liga side to sell ‘Xabi Alonso’s biggest critic’, which would be a club-record deal for the Red Devils.",
      "The report adds: ‘In England, Valverde is considered an ideal player for the dynamic and physical style United seeks. His ability to arrive late into the box, his power, stamina, and versatility fit perfectly into Amorim ‘s plans . The English club doesn’t want a loan; they want a permanent signing to strengthen their midfield and give them complete control of a player they consider strategic for the coming seasons.’",
      "The Uruguay international is ‘seriously considering a change of scenery’ in the summer with the ‘prospect of being an undisputed starter and leader of the midfield is an attraction that is beginning to outweigh his attachment to Real Madrid’.",
      "The report continues: ‘Manchester United understands that this could be the perfect opportunity to acquire an elite player who still has great potential. The €120m offer not only demonstrates the English club’s ambition but also makes it clear that they are prepared to negotiate quickly if Real Madrid agrees to let them go. Those close to Valverde view the possibility of leaving and playing in his ideal position favorably.’",
      "Man Utd are ready to splash out on one of two Real Madrid players in the summer, while they want Antoine Semenyo in January, according to reports.",
      "Rumoured Man Utd target Federico Valverde is reportedly the subject of a bid from a mystery club amid unrest at Xabi Alonso’s Real Madrid.",

      "Manchester United are planning an ambitious raid on Real Madrid, apparently. But how likely is that to work?",
      "Chelsea have ‘agreed’ a deal to swap Enzo Fernandez for Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde in a blow to Man Utd, according to reports."

      "Mediawatch often begins this column with ‘we don’t know where to start with…’ but sometimes a headline lands and there really is only one place to start.",
      "Ruben Amorim goes on rampage against Man Utd academy with three popular stars singled out",
      "The use of the word ‘rampage’ by The Sun here is – and we do not say this lightly – absolutely mental.",
      "A ‘rampage’ is ‘a period of violent and uncontrollable behaviour by a group of people’. It is not ‘a slightly odd series of comments by one man quite obviously getting fed up of being constantly asked about Kobbie Mainoo‘.",
      "Let’s park the concept that Amorim is probably right for a minute, and wonder if a man can go ‘on the attack’ by pointing out that he played Toby Collyer, Harry Amass and Chido Obi last season, so it’s hardly like he is averse to playing Manchester United Academy players.",
      "He was literally asked if Mainoo could play in the Casemiro role and pointed out that Collyer had played there last season but added:",
      "“He is from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich and he’s not playing. He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it’s not because he’s from the academy or whatever. It’s the situation that’s happened.”",
      "Amorim has a point. And it was clearly neither a ‘rampage’ nor an ‘attack’, just a man getting rather frustrated at being asked seven straight questions about a player not currently in his team.",
      "This is so very clearly the result of one of those post-press conference huddles where everybody decides that the ‘line’ is an Academy attack, despite it being very clearly absolutely nothing of the sort.",
      "What Amorim said was this about Mainoo:",
      "“Of course, he’s not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year. Everyone had.",
      "“Especially last year, everyone had. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in U21. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying, sack the manager.”",
      "Again, he has a point. He was playing Academy players when United were losing games and he was under pressure, so why is he getting flak when he is not playing Academy players and United are in better form?",
      "As for ‘popular stars’…what an absolute load of bollocks. There is no world in which Harry Amass is described as a ‘popular star’ unless you are trying to have a needless dig at Amorim.",
      "And there’s no way Toby Collyer is a ‘kid’ either, but the Daily Mail will have their fun. This is their actual top story on Monday morning…",
      "Ruben Amorim attacks Man United’s academy and NAMES three kids who haven’t hit his standards and are now ‘struggling’ in his bid to justify axeing Kobbie Mainoo, who now wants out",
      "He has ‘attacked’ the Academy by *checks notes* pointing out that he has used Academy players in the past and they are not now in his plans? This is getting weird now.",
      "Ruben Amorim has called into question the quality of Manchester United’s academy graduates, with the Red Devils boss taking aim at three fan-favourites.",
      "That hyphen makes us itch, but not as much as this blatant weaponisation of some pretty anodyne quotes to suggest that Amorim has launched an unsolicited attack on the United Academy.",
      "‘Amorim has insisted he won’t be swayed by sentiment’? What an absolute dick. Won’t somebody please think of the children. Especially the 21-year-old ones.",

      "Amorim discussed the form of Harry Amass, Chido Obi, and Toby Collyer ahead of the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with Bournemouth on Monday night.",
      "We’re not convinced Amorim is picking his battles very wisely.",
      "He explained why Mainoo has barely featured this season: the 20-year-old is competing for a starting spot with Man United captain and Amorim’s key player, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Amorim believes Fernandes and Mainoo cannot coexist in a midfield two, which is a fair assessment. The former needs a more defensive-minded partner, and Casemiro complements him well.",
      "It’s a shame Mainoo is playing so little under the Portuguese head coach, and supporters are understandably upset that his progress is being stalled. Many fear selling such a promising academy graduate, which could happen in January.",

      "The United boss justified his decision to continuously bench Mainoo by citing other academy players who are currently struggling.",
      "Some might argue Amorim has thrown youngsters Collyer, Obi, and Amass under the bus to defend himself. We wouldn’t go as far as to say it was an ‘attack’. And he definitely wasn’t on a ‘rampage’.",
      "Collyer is currently injured at loan club West Brom after making just a handful of first-team appearances last season. Amass is performing well at Championship bottom-club Sheffield Wednesday, and Obi has struggled playing for United’s Under-21s.",
      "In an effort to rationalise keeping Mainoo on the bench, Amorim said: “He (Collyer) played (for the United first team). He’s from the academy. He played here.",
      "“He went to West Bromwich. He’s not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it’s not because he’s from the academy or whatever.",

      "“Sometimes they don’t have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here, always winning. So it’s hard for them to see their club in this situation,” Amorim said.",
      "“I take that naturally. It’s a fact that me as a manager of Manchester United, I think we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season.",
      "“The problem is that me, as a manager, I’m not doing good enough and I can accept that. So that is the only problem. Not winning is the issue.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Victory over Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now 10 wins in 11 Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though, but spangling Tottenham will have gone down enormously well with his boss for sure.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",

      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "But derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting, and the reality is that Howe and Newcastle remain for now behind Tottenham in the league, and that is not the place any self-respecting club should currently find themselves, all things considered.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A pair of subsequent wins cool the immediate temperatures but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options that prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. We don’t know, but we’d certainly contend he’s unlucky to be second favourite at this time on current form.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",

      "Manchester United close out the Premier League gameweek as Bournemouth head to Old Trafford looking to extend a recent run of strong results against the Red Devils.",
      "United arrive on the back of an emphatic 4-1 win at Wolves, a performance that briefly silenced fears of another late wobble after Jean-Ricner Bellegarde’s equaliser threatened an upset.",
      "Bruno Fernandes took control from there, scoring twice and assisting Mason Mount, while Bryan Mbeumo, who may jet off to AFCON before this game, also found the net.",
      "That result pushed Ruben Amorim’s side into the top six and continued a strong recent run. United have lost just one of their last nine league matches and collected 18 points in that spell.",
      "However, consistency at Old Trafford remains an issue. United have now gone two home league games without a win and have conceded in 14 of their 15 Premier League matches this season.",
      "Bournemouth have won 3-0 at Old Trafford in each of the last two league campaigns and are unbeaten in four Premier League meetings with United.",
      "Manchester United will monitor the availability of several players ahead of kick-off, with Amad Diallo, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui not yet ruled out despite impending AFCON call-ups.",
      "Benjamin Sesko could also feature despite recent illness, but Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined with back and hamstring injuries, respectively.",
      "Ayden Heaven is expected to continue at the heart of defence after impressing again against Wolves, particularly if Lisandro Martinez is not deemed ready to start.",
      "(3-4-2-1) Lammens; Mazraoui, Heaven, Shaw; Diallo, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha",
      "Bournemouth will hope Marcos Senesi is fit to start after being forced off late against Chelsea, with Andoni Iraola confident the issue was cramp rather than injury.",
      "Lewis Cook serves the final match of his three-game suspension, but Tyler Adams returns to midfield following a yellow-card ban.",
      "Veljko Milosavljevic remains out long-term, joining Ryan Christie and Ben-Gannon Doak on the sidelines, while Antoine Semenyo is expected to start despite ongoing transfer speculation.",
      "(4-2-3-1) Petrovic; Smith, Diakite, Senesi, Truffert; Adams, Scott; Brooks, Tavernier, Semenyo; Evanilson",
      "– Man Utd sit seventh with 25 points, while Bournemouth are 14th on 20.",
      "– United have lost just one of their last nine Premier League games.",
      "– United have kept only one clean sheet in 15 league matches this season.",
      "– Bruno Fernandes has been involved in eight goals in his last eight league matches.",
      "– Bournemouth are winless in their last six Premier League games (D2 L4).",
      "– Bournemouth have beaten Man Utd 3-0 at Old Trafford in each of the last two seasons.",
      "– United are winless in their last four league meetings with Bournemouth.",
      "– Bournemouth have failed to score in their last two league games.",
      "United’s win at Wolves was impressive, but it does little to hide their ongoing issues at Old Trafford.",
      "They continue to concede regularly at home, and their record against Bournemouth’s style should be a concern for punters.",
      "Bournemouth’s own form has dipped, yet their performances against United have remained strong. Two straight 3-0 wins at Old Trafford is not a coincidence, as this fixture suits them tactically.",
      "With United conceding in almost every league game and Bournemouth needing a response after six without a win, the away side stand a better chance of bouncing back than the odds suggest.",
      "We will happily chance Bournemouth to beat Man Utd at 14/5.",
      "Even during Bournemouth’s downturn, Antoine Semenyo remains a reliable threat.",
      "He averages over one shot on target per 90 minutes this season and has hit the target 19 times from 34 attempts.",
      "Semenyo has also scored in each of his last two league games against United, and with Bournemouth likely to play on the counter, he should see chances again.",
      "Back Semenyo to score or assist at 5/4."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things might be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. Dubravka has made more saves than any other keeper having faced 17 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding three to Manchester City from a PSxG of 1.7. The number is damning but the Palace keeper passed the eye test, especially around Erling Haaland’s brace, and to expect more in the face of Phil Foden’s 20-yarder feels harsh.",
      "",
      "Only Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. On Saturday, like Pickford, he conceded two from a PSxG of 1.2 at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest.",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive. Back to being solid at Palace and it wasn’t his fault v West Ham.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched. Conceded four goals v Fulham and looked a little lost. Made one excellent save v Sunderland and stopped all fur shots on his goal taken by Palace.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet at Wolves was very, very welcome. The battering by Everton and a groin twang less so.",
      "",
      "Making just five saves in five Premier League appearances hardly screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1’. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up and returned once more at West Ham. Conceding five goals from 2.8 PSxG was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regain shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest and not great against former club Manchester United. Then, at Arsenal, he was just plain unlucky.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season but when Arsenal have needed him, has he done enough? Reports suggest the Gunners might be looking to upgrade.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Conceded eight goals in his last four Premier League games but nobody gives a f*** at Leeds.",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he?",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",
      "Arsenal are top of the actual table – but these standings prove why the Gunners would be right to be wary while Manchester City sniff blood…",
      "Arsenal winning the title? That was always possible. Viktor Gyokeres flopping hard? That was always possible. Both those things happening? A great bit.",
      "There’s a bloodbath at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim goes on a ‘rampage’, with THREE kids in his crosshairs.",
      "Arne Slot has emerged from a period in which his position as Liverpool manager should have been rendered ‘untenable’, and has rarely looked more secure.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is ‘the worst footballer that I’ve seen at Arsenal since Lee Chapman’, says one Arsenal fan. Does Mikel Arteta need to make a choice?",
      "Had we said in August that Chelsea would have one man in this team by mid-December, you probably wouldn’t have picked this guy."

Not exactly; Roma must reach a financial agreement with the player (he earns €4 million net per season) and with the Red Devils. But trust is there and growing significantly day by day. The parties are negotiating on the basis of a loan deal with favorable terms, triggering an obligation to buy for a total package worth €35 million.’",

With the manager right now, he should be doing as much as he can to help the club get out of the worst run they’ve had since the 1950s and he hasn’t done that.",

But we accept it because he’s a superstar and he’s scored 250 goals and he’s given me as a Liverpool supporter some of the greatest nights of my life.”",

      "The England international requested an exit in the summer, but Man Utd denied his departure at the time as they did not want to be left short in midfield.",
      "However, Mainoo’s situation has not changed in the last few months and a loan move to Napoli remains on the table after they missed out in the summer.",
      "A recent report claimed a deal is already ‘99%’ done ahead of January, but a new report from Italian outlet Il Mattino claims the ‘priority’ transfer could collapse as Napoli have set a deadline while they wait for Amorim to give his ‘final approval’.",

      "“I think he tried to leave in the summer to follow Scott McTominay to Napoli, but the club blocked the move. Players want game time and Kobbie is no different from any other player; he wants to play as much as possible and improve his game, which he can’t do from the bench at Man United currently.”",
      "He added: “Kobbie Mainoo played himself into the United team and the England set-up by playing absolutely fantastic football for someone so young. He established himself in this team as a starter, and the club and United fans love to see a young player from the academy being successful in the first team.",
      "“For whatever reason, Amorim doesn’t seem keen to play Kobbie which frustrates the fans and myself as I think he is a really talented player.",
      "“I think the reason his game time has been significantly reduced is due to the signings United made over the summer and the formation they play. Signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo meant Bruno Fernandes has slotted back into a more defensive position, where we have seen Mainoo play in recent years.",
      "“I can’t fathom why Mainoo and Bruno can’t play together, but maybe Amorim thinks they’re too similar. I would definitely like to see them play together. Kobbie is a top player with plenty of potential, but United are winning games at the moment, so he may have to wait it out for a while for a chance to start in this team again.”",

      "A very silly report has claimed that FC Barcelona have decided to include Marcus Rashford in a swap deal with La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy for around £26m from Premier League giants Man Utd in the summer.",
      "The England international secured his dream move to the Spanish giants after returning to form during his loan spell at Aston Villa at the end of last season.",
      "Barcelona were linked with alternatives, but they opted to take a punt on Rashford after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams, with the forward’s versatility attracting head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "Rashford was only expected to be a bit-part player for Barcelona, but his great form has forced Flick into playing him consistently, as he has sparkled this season. He has six goals and eleven assists in his 21 appearances across all competitions.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Sunderland v Newcastle, Aston Villa, Xavi Simons, Oliver Glasner",
      "Therefore, it feels pretty likely that Rashford will join Barcelona permanently, though a new report from an outlet in Spain claims they have an ‘unexpected alternative’ in mind.",
      "Instead, Barcelona are said to have an outlandish plan to sign and offload Rashford in the same window, with the club reportedly including him in a £61m [70 million euros] swap deal with Atletico Madrid to sign former Manchester City star Julian Alvarez.",
      "Will this happen? No. But who would we be if we faulted their imagination?",
      "The report goes onto say that the ‘conditions are set’ for this deal, with a £61m fee and Rashford said to be used by Barcelona to acquire Alvarez.",

      "The report explains: ‘Atlético Madrid haven’t ruled out signing the English striker if Julián Álvarez ultimately ends up at Barcelona. Diego Simeone greatly appreciates Rashford ‘s profile, particularly his speed and directness in exploiting space from any attacking area. For the Argentine coach, acquiring a player of that calibre would be a way to compensate for such a significant loss as that of the Argentine striker.",
      "‘Thus, Atlético has set its conditions. They value Julián Álvarez at €120 million and Rashford at around €50 million, which is why they are demanding an additional €70 million for the deal to move forward and be finalised.’",
      "Regarding Rashford’s resurgence over the past year, former Man Utd player West Brown has explained why he was “always going to do well” after leaving the Red Devils.",
      "“Marcus Rashford was always going to do well after moving away from Manchester United. He’d been at the club for so many years and not all those years would have been enjoyable for Marcus, particularly the final couple,” Brown told BetWright Casino.",
      "“He got a lot of stick from people towards the end of last season, so I don’t blame him for making a change, and I think his departure suited United as well. No one thought that he was going to leave and be shocking, but he just wasn’t in the right headspace to perform at United – it wasn’t working.",
      "“It’s great to see how well he is doing now at Barcelona, he’s absolutely flying and he deserved to get back into the England squad. I’m sure he will have a great World Cup.”",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has suggested Spurs are “scraping around for players” amid links to Marcus Rashford, who he wouldn’t sign given a lack of loyalty.",
      "Spurs legend Chris Waddle has explained why he thinks his former club should snub Marcus Rashford, but he would actually be a no-brainer signing…",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford could now return to Old Trafford as Barcelona are ‘not convinced’ by the England international, according to reports.",
      "Barcelona are uncertain about signing Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United, according to reports in Spain.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",

      "Their latest on Wharton claims Man Utd are ‘preparing to complete a blockbuster signing’, with the club having ‘activated one of the most ambitious moves in their sporting planning and are preparing to launch a €100 million bid [£87.5m] for Wharton’.",

      "‘Manchester United knows it’s not alone in the race for Adam Wharton. Manchester City and Arsenal have shown genuine interest in the midfielder, while Tottenham have also inquired with Crystal Palace.’",
      "There are a couple of reasons why this is incredibly unlikely.",
      "Firstly, why on earth would Crystal Palace accept £87.5m for Wharton when a World Cup is approaching, and there are multiple Big Six sides in the market for a centre-midfielder?",
      "To put it simply, they would not and it would actually take an offer above £100m to get Palace, who have remained firm in the past regarding Marc Guehi, to the negotiating table.",
      "Also, Wharton is capable of playing in the No.6 role, but he is far from specialised in this position, as he is better used as a No.8, so Baleba and Anderson are far more obvious fixes to Man Utd’s defensive midfield problem than the Palace star.",
      "It is not unusual for Fichajes to talk utter nonsense, but the one truthful suggestion in this report is that Man Utd’s supposed swoop for Wharton is the ‘most ambitious move’, because it is not going to happen…",
      "The agent of Crystal Palace star and Manchester United target Adam Wharton has spoken openly about a future transfer.",

      "Signing a new central midfielder for Ruben Amorim is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 plans, but Manchester United’s “try before you buy” interest in Conor Gallagher is as underwhelming as it is baffling.",
      "Casemiro proving that the football hasn’t left him quite yet has made the requirement for a new midfielder feel less urgent than it did a few weeks ago, and may very well have saved Amorim from the sack, but it remains the area of the squad the Old Trafford hierarchy want to strengthen as a priority.",
      "Director of Football Jason Wilcox insisted in October that recruitment will be focused on “the right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure”.",
      "“They have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team,” he added.",
      "And while Gallagher – who swapped Chelsea for Atletico Madrid for £34m in the summer of 2024 – unquestionably meets that first requirement and arguably the second too, quite how he would fit into Amorim’s team is a mystery.",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils were interested in Gallagher as the summer transfer window was coming to a close having asked about the availability of Carlos Baleba and been told by Brighton he would cost them £100m.",
      "But Gallagher is no alternative to Baleba, Elliot Anderson or the other midfielders Man Utd have been linked with of late.",
      "He’s played just three of his 72 games for Atletico Madrid as the defensive midfielder Amorim covets and at Chelsea was far more regularly used in an attacking midfield role, with protection always afforded to him by Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo. Gareth Southgate played him in that deep-lying role for England at the start of Euro 2024 and it was a disaster.",
      "And yet, according to transfer expert Ben Jacobs, United could revisit their interest in Gallagher in a ‘try before you buy’ deal with Atletico Madrid ‘open’ to an initial loan.",
      "Speaking on The United Stand, Jacobs said: “Man United see Conor Gallagher as a good ‘try before you buy’ option, if Atletico are open to a loan deal next month.”",
      "It would be an underwhelming signing. Gallagher was very good in a very bad Chelsea team before departing for La Liga, but he’s a workhorse; a ‘safe pair of hands’ who’s started just seven games for Atletico Madrid this season.",
      "And while he’s ‘the sort of player every manager wants in their team’, he isn’t – and this is the only point that matters here – a composed, deep-lying screen for the back five. What they need as an Adam Wharton and what they would be signing is another, arguably inferior, Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The wantaway academy graduate isn’t playing as he can’t provide the foil for Bruno Fernandes to thrive like Casemiro or – ostensibly – Manuel Ugarte can.",
      "And although Amorim wouldn’t have the same apparent concerns over Gallagher’s ability to “get round the pitch” that he apparently has with Mainoo, signing a player – even on loan – knowing that they’re going to be something of a square peg in a round hole makes very little sense.",
      "We understand Amorim’s desire for hard-working fighters in midfield, but what currently looks like a very wide net they’ve cast to find one needs to be narrowed to only include those who can dovetail with his captain. If Kobbie Mainoo isn’t that man, then neither is Conor Gallagher.",
      "Ruben Amorim has responded to criticism from Paul Scholes with the former Man Utd midfielder claiming the Red Devils head coach is not “the right man”.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed why Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim may refuse to sanction two deals in next month’s window.",

      "Sunday 14 December 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says he is open to speaking to Kobbie Mainoo about his Manchester United future if the midfielder still wants to leave on loan in January.",
      "Mainoo, who requested a temporary switch in the summer, is yet to start a Premier League game this season, despite the United head coach saying he views the academy graduate \"as a starter like the other players\" after the 4-1 win at Wolves.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo has infuriated club legends Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Nicky Butt who have all said the 20-year-old should leave United rather than waste his career waiting for opportunities.",
      "Mainoo started for England in the Euros final in July 2024 but his lack of playing time has left him out of the picture under Thomas Tuchel, with reports claiming he wants to join Napoli on loan to get into the World Cup squad.",
      "Asked if he would sanction a January loan move should Mainoo request it, Amorim said: \"If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody.\"",
      "Amorim insists Mainoo's reduced role is solely down to the fact he is competing for a starting position with Bruno Fernandes, who he says is \"really hard to take out of the team\".",
      "United captain Fernandes has started every league game and only been taken off early twice, in the 87th minute against Chelsea and 85th minute at Liverpool, highlighting how limited the opportunities are for Mainoo to play in that position.",
      "Amorim believes Mainoo has the characteristics to play in the other role in his midfield pairing that Casemiro regularly occupies but says the 20-year-old needs to think more about his defensive duties if he is to make it his own with so many attackers in the team.",
      "\"If you look at our team with [Matheus] Cunha, Bryan [Mbeumo], Bruno [Fernandes], that you guys say is a No 10, sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think, I'm the guy for blocking transitions, all these things.",
      "\"He needs to spend more time there, but he can be in the future in that position. So I don't know what is going to happen.\"",
      "Casemiro had to work hard to convince Amorim he should be a regular starter after initially being displaced by academy midfielder Toby Collyer last season.",
      "Collyer has been on loan at West Brom this season and struggled for game-time in the Championship before being sidelined with an injury that he is currently having treated at United.",
      "\"[Toby Collyer] is from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich and he's not playing,\" said Amorim, who has faced criticism for his use of the academy.",
      "\"He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation that's happened.\"",
      "Asked if he actually rates Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, like everyone else. The problem is we are playing with two [in midfield] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing.",
      "\"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, Kobbie will have more minutes. Imagine that this happens. Someone in front is going to lose their spot. Sometimes it's just the moment.",
      "\"I think I proved that if you change my mind [you can get into the team]. Casemiro is the biggest example. He was behind Toby and now he is a starter.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"The door is open for any player to change my mind. But in the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year.",
      "\"I just look at the team and try to win the next game. I will do that until the end.",
      "\"Kobbs is one more player that I understand all the interests. I understand how important it is. The hopes that you guys and English guys have. I also just want to win. If he's the right guy, I will put him in. No problem.\"",
      "Quite a few players over the past few days have had their say about Kobbie Mainoo over the last few days. I don't want to ask you about Mainoo again, but how frustrating is it for you to have ex-players and pundits having their say like this?",
      "\"I think it's normal. I think it's a fact that me as a manager of Manchester United, I think we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season. So I take it that naturally.",
      "\"Sometimes they don't have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here, always winning. So it's hard for them to see their club in this situation.",
      "\"About Kobbie, I can speak about Kobbie every press conference. Sometimes it's harder for me to speak after the game. It's always the same situation for me. All of them are the same.",
      "\"I know that for you guys, there are some players that you believe a lot and I believe a lot. But sometimes they have to make choices.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders in these games. We could change in the future. But Kobbie is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes. Sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "If Mainoo comes to you and says [a loan] is want I want in January, will you sanction that given how little play time he is getting?",
      "\"First of all, the team comes first. If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody.",
      "\"But again, the focus is on this game. We will see if that happens.\"",
      "Have you not had that real conversation this season then in terms of him airing his frustrations?",
      "\"Not about that. I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him.\"",
      "Are you a manger that wants your players to discuss that?",
      "\"I'm completely open. I think that is clear.",
      "\"What I don't promise is to… I have my ideas. That is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it, but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",
      "Could Mainoo not play in Casemiro's position because Casemiro sometimes comes off after 65 minutes…?",
      "\"Yes, he can. Against West Ham was Manu [Ugarte] that comes for Bruno's position. Bruno goes up because I was feeling with 10 minutes [to go], it is going to be long balls and second balls. I was thinking about that.",
      "\"I think it was against Everton I took Casemiro out, and I put Kobbie in because we were trying to play a different game.",
      "\"He can play in that position but it's hard sometimes. If you look at our team with Cunha, Bryan, Bruno, that you guys say is a No 10, sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think, I'm the guy for blocking transitions, all these things.",
      "\"He needs to spend more time there, but he can be in the future in that position. So I don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"Toby and his injury, he's returning here. He's from the academy, he played here. Went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation that's happened.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to be the future. We'll see after this match.\"",

      "On that note, would you like to be more proactive in coming to him and saying, look, head coach, what do I need to do? What part of my game do I need to improve?",
      "\"It's like any other player. The door is open for any player to change my mind. But in the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year. Everyone had [opportunities].",
      "\"Especially last year, everyone had. [Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido [Obi] is not always a starter in U21. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying, sack the manager. You can see that I'm not worried. In that time, everybody [said that].",

      "Redundancies and other cost-cutting measures at Man Utd have been reflected in their latest quarterly financial results; there have been small losses that will not be significant for a business of their size; the results will also not affect their plans for the January transfer window",
      "Thursday 11 December 2025 23:12, UK",
      "Manchester United's controversial cost-cutting measures under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are reflected in an operating profit, as the club released their results for the first quarter of the new financial year.",
      "The headlines from the latest report include:",
      "Chief executive officer Omar Berrada said: \"These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club.",
      "\"The difficult decisions we have made in the past year have resulted in a sustainably lower cost base and a more streamlined, effective organisation equipped to drive the club towards improved sporting and commercial performance over the long-term.",
      "\"That has helped us to invest in our men's and women's teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and Women's Super League respectively.\"",
      "The total revenue is down two per cent from the first three months of the last financial year, with other revenue streams also reporting individual losses.",
      "But these are very small reductions in each case, nothing too significant for a club and business the size of Manchester United.",
      "But crucially, despite all those revenue streams reducing, Man Utd's operating profile went from a loss of £7m a year ago to a profit of £13m now.",
      "It shows that Man Utd have been cost-cutting right across the business, and doing it effectively. This includes redundancies and other cost-cutting measures to reduce their cost base, but this has not proven popular in some areas of the club.",
      "\"It's not huge changes in the figures from a year ago, and this won't make any difference to the club's approach to the upcoming transfer window.",
      "\"Whilst Berrada has hailed the robust' financial figures, and pointed out in this financial statement that Man Utd are 'committed to, and complying with, the Premier League's PSR rules' - the truth is, Man Utd don't have huge money to spend, and it is much more likely they will save their big transfer investment until the summer, rather than pay what would likely be inflated fees to try to land some of their targets in January.",
      "\"Signing a world-class defensive midfielder remains the priority, but again, that is much more likely in the summer rather than January, with interest in Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba.\"",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Kaveh Solhekol",
      "Wednesday 10 December 2025 16:29, UK",
      "Joshua Zirkzee wants to stay at Manchester United to fight for his place in the squad amid interest from Roma.",
      "United are aware of the interest but are not thought to be actively looking to sell Zirkzee when the transfer window opens - and he has recently made an impact in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "He started up front against West Ham on December 14 and was a late substitute in the 4-1 win at Wolves four days later.",
      "Amorim is short of forward options given a recent injury to Benjamin Sesko, although Matheus Cunha has returned from a spell on the sidelines.",
      "United are set to lose Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations in the coming week, with the tournament starting on December 21. The final takes place on January 18.",
      "The United forward has a contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2029, with the option of another 12 months.",
      "Zirkzee has made three starts in the Premier League this term and named in Amorim's first XI in three of United's last four games. He has played a total of 345 minutes, scoring once.",
      "A glance at Joshua Zirkzee's numbers this season, or indeed since he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, would suggest that allowing him to leave in January would be no great loss to Manchester United.",
      "Clearly, the forward has not managed to do much to impress Ruben Amorim. United's elaborate £207m spend on three new forwards in this most recent transfer window tells you as much. In total, Zirkzee has scored eight goals in all competitions across a fairly underwhelming 18 months in United colours. Physicality has been an issue, and productivity under pressure hard to come by.",
      "But, and this is important, United at this juncture cannot spare him. His smart equaliser from a tight angle in last month's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace showed glimpses of what he's about and why United signed him in the first place. Amorim singled him out for praise after that performance.",
      "Besides, options are few. The loss of Bryan Mbeumo surely necessitates he stays beyond January, even if he's only used from the bench. United do not have the same bounty of forwards with Mbeumo gone and Sesko injured as many of their closest rivals, and that alone is perhaps argument enough for Zirkzee to stay put.",

      "Many Wolves supporters missed the first 15 minutes of the match as they protested about the club's ownership, although they did not miss much from a Wolves side who looked bereft of quality and confidence early on, United cutting through with ease.",
      "Diogo Dalot wasted a one-on-one, while Sam Johnstone also saved from Mbeumo before Casemiro robbed a dallying Andre and the ball was worked to Fernandes who had time to slip over and still get to his feet to sneak the ball past the goalkeeper.",
      "Toti Gomes had to clear off the line from Matheus Cunha, returning to face his former club, and at that stage Wolves looked there for the taking. But as has often been the case under Amorim, United surrendered the initiative, allowing the bottom club back in.",
      "The home side sensed it, Ki-Jana Hoever's cross finding David Moller Wolfe who put the ball back into the box for Bellegarde, Wolves' best player before going off injured, to force home smartly. The first goal of Edwards' reign coming in his fourth game in charge.",
      "But more hapless defending from Wolves allowed United to restore their lead early in the second half, Dalot again racing through down the left channel before squaring for Mbeumo to slot into the net with Johnstone stranded for his first goal in exactly a month.",
      "A moment of quality from Fernandes saw him dink the ball into the path of Mount for the third goal before Yerson Mosquera was adjudged to have handballed in the area, allowing Fernandes to smash in his second from the spot. Wolves were well beaten.",
      "Their fate appears sealed already even in December.",
      "What lies ahead for Amorim's United this season remains a mystery.",
      "Wolves equalled their longest-ever losing streak in league history, also losing eight in a row between December 1981 and February 1982.\n\n\nWolves’ haul of only two points in the Premier League this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers, level with Sheffield United in the Premier League in 2020-21, Southport in 1975-76 in the Fourth Division and Barrow and Newport County in 1970-71 in the Fourth Division.",
      "Fellow playmaker James Maddison praised Fernandes in the Monday Night Football studio. \"Bruno Fernandes is underrated for the consistency he shows regularly,\" said the Tottenham player. \"Every time he is on the ball, he can just see it all.\"",
      "Fernandes showed that with his assist for Mount's goal. He punished Wolves and now has 15 goal involvements in his last 14 Premier League games for Manchester United against sides starting the day in the relegation zone - six goals and nine assists.",
      "\"I thought some of the combinations going forward were crisp, were sharp and that's what we can do.",
      "\"We know we can do that. It's about us creating as many chances as we can as forward players and trying to get on the scoresheet. I thought going forward we were solid, and as a defence it's about defending as a team and not letting them have any chances to get back into the game.\"",
      "\"We scored four but had a lot of shots. I cannot make that connection with being more clinical. We improved a lot.",
      "\"If you compare last season and this season, we are creating so much more chances and scoring more goals and having more real situations of danger. I am really pleased with that.\"",

I thought if they replicated that they could give Man Utd a game but when you see some of the defending against an average Man Utd team.
