      "Cristiano Ronaldo burst into tears after missing a penalty for Portugal at Euro 2024, and has now explained the reason behind his emotional reaction",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has explained why he burst into tears after missing a crucial penalty for Portugal at Euro 2024.",
      "The 39-year-old, who failed to score a single goal at the tournament, saw an extra time spot-kick saved by Jan Oblak during Portugal's last-16 tie with Slovenia. He was seen blubbing minutes later during an on-field team talk, but managed to rally and score in the subsequent shootout, which Portugal won 3-0.",
      "In the aftermath, Ronaldo was relentlessly mocked on social media, with some accusing him of letting his ego get the better of him. But the Al-Nassr forward insists that couldn't be further from the truth.",
      "\"When you have passion for what you are doing, you can't be worried about how you're feeling,\" he said while chatting to former Manchester United team-mate Rio Ferdinand on his UR Cristiano Ronaldo YouTube channel.",
      "\"For example, I cried the day I missed the penalty... when I cried, it's not because I felt that if I don't score Portugal will be eliminated, and the world will collapse on me. It's not because of that.",
      "\"People, they don't know me. Imagine that the last 27 penalties, you score. And in that period, you feel bad for yourself. The people who come to the stadium, your kids, your mum, your girlfriend, everyone. I feel sad because of that.\"",
      "Ronaldo said that when the high standards he sets for himself aren't met, it can take a toll on him emotionally. However, he insisted that's what makes him authentic. \"I didn't even think about [Portugal losing],\" he said.",
      "\"I felt sad because of the pressure I put on myself since I was 11-years-old. 'Cristiano Ronaldo you are the best player in the world', I'm always thinking that in my mind. And I put a lot of pressure on myself [because of that].",
      "\"So when things go wrong, you feel that. But I love that, I know how to deal with that. But when I missed the penalty I felt bad for myself, for the fans, family - not because of other stuff. You have to express yourself. For me, if you hide this stuff, you're not being yourself.\"",
      "Portugal were ultimately eliminated by France in the quarter-finals of Euros following another penalty shootout. Just as he did against Slovenia, Ronaldo scored in the shootout, but Portugal were beaten 5-3. It marked the first major international tournament that Ronaldo, who struggled to make any sort of impact during the competition, failed to find the back of the net in.",

Chelsea's new boss has instead favoured Marc Cucurella and new signing Renato Veiga as his options to head into the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "That has left Chilwell training away from the first team, in addition to a number of other players including Raheem Sterling. The Stamford Bridge stars have been the subject of conversations with the possibilty of a deal being made with Manchester United before the end of the transfer window.",

Chelsea had offered their 27-year-old defender to United as executives debated the possibility of finding solutions for Chilwell, Sterling and Jadon Sancho.",

For some players, it's sometimes better to leave and to go somewhere to get minutes. We will see what happens, the transfer window is open and we will see what happens.\"",
      "A move to Old Trafford may have been appealing to Chilwell, who has fond memories of visiting Old Trafford as a child. \"I used to go to Man United games, funnily enough, with my dad, who supported them,\" he said last year.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is still going strong despite being on the verge of turning 40, and the Portugal superstar has revealed what he wants to achieve before calling it a day",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says he plans on playing for at least another two years amid talk of a sensational return to Manchester United.",
      "The 39-year-old is well into the twilight of his incredible career - one that few footballers in history could ever hope to emulate. After his brace for Al Nassr against Al Feiha on Tuesday, Ronaldo is now just one strike away from reaching 900 career goals.",
      "Speaking to former United team-mate Rio Ferdinand, Ronaldo admitted his main focus is on reaching quadruple figures, which suggests retirement plans aren't even being considered yet. \"One thing that I've learned in the last few years is [to] enjoy the moment. Live the moment because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow,\" he said on his UR Cristiano YouTube channel.",
      "\"I know I'm still looking good, I feel that I can still dribble, score goals, shoot, jump. The day that I start to feel that I can't produce anything I will pack by bags and go away.\"",
      "Continuing, he boasted: \"I scored 60 goals [last] season, but I didn't score in five games at the Euros and people ask 'What's going on? What's the problem?' [But] I scored 130 [goals for Portugal], I'm the [best goalscorer at international level] in the world's history.",
      "\"Soon I will [score] 900 [career goals], and after that I will beat 1,000. I want to reach it.\" Ferdinand asked him how old he reckoned he'd be by the time he reached the milestone, to which Ronaldo replied: \"41? I don't know. This is why I told you I want to leave the present.",
      "\"But if I don't have injuries, this is the most important thing. I want [to reach 1,000 goals]. For me it's the best mark that I can have in football.\"",
      "Ronaldo is statistically the highest competitive goalscorer in the history of football, with eternal rival Lionel Messi behind him on 838 goals, and Brazil legend Pele in third-place on 762. There are claims Pele scored over 1,000 goals, though his record is disputed as many of the goals were scored in non-competitive friendly and exhibition matches.",
      "Poking fun at the three-time World Cup winner, Ronaldo told Ferdinand: \"There is one difference [with my goals record]. All the goals that I scored, they have video. So I can prove that [they happened].\"",
      "Ronaldo recently claimed he plans to finish his career at Al-Nassr. \"I don't know if I will retire soon, in two or three years, but probably I will retire here at Al-Nassr,\" he told Portuguese outlet Now. \"I'm happy at this club. I feel good in this country too. I'm happy to play in Saudi Arabia and I want to continue.\"",
      "Earlier this month, ex-United star Louis Saha tipped Ronaldo for a shock return to Old Trafford at some point in the future, citing the fact the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has \"unfinished business\" at the club following his acrimonious exit in 2022.",
      "\"Cristiano Ronaldo has the passion and dedication to return to Manchester United one day,\" Saha told TVSporten. \"That could be as a coach or even a manager.",
      "\"His second spell didn’t end how everyone had hoped, and you can see why that frustrated him. He didn’t see the same formula and didn’t see the passion from young players that he had been used to seeing.\"",
      "Ronaldo made 346 appearances for the Red Devils over two separate spells, scoring 145 goals. His second stint ended in disaster after he was dropped from the first team by new manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "In response, Ronaldo slammed both the manager and the club in a now infamous interview with Piers Morgan. A few days later, his contract was terminated by mutual consent.",

      "Ronaldo joined Al Nassr from Manchester United just before the 2022 World Cup, shocking the world of football with his switch to Saudi Arabia. It followed an explosive tell-all interview with Piers Morgan about his second spell at the Red Devils, which put him on a collision course with Erik ten Hag and ultimately saw him leave the club by mutual agreement.",
      "Once it became apparent that he would not get a lucrative contract offer in Europe, Ronaldo joined Al Nassr in a move that sparked a massive influx of foreign talent into the Middle East. While the 39-year-old reiterated the respect he holds for Saudi football, Ronaldo revealed his motivation – and that of other players in the league – for going to Saudi and admitted that money is the \"main reason\" why it has attracted the stars it now boasts.",
      "\"Any place I play, I show my level,” Ronaldo revealed on his UR Cristiano YouTube channel. “I knew that there [Saudi Arabia] I would show my level as well. I will improve the league, and I knew that players would follow me.\"",
      "The list of talent that followed Ronaldo to Saudi Arabia makes for astounding reading. The list of names is headlined by his former team-mate Karim Benzema, as well as the likes of N'Golo Kante, Sadio Mane, and Neymar, who upon his arrival stated: \"Cristiano started all of this, and they called him crazy.\"",
      "Ronaldo continued, referencing the financial incentives that are on offer in Saudi Arabia. \"I knew that players would follow because, not only in financial terms, which is the main point you can say, but as well the culture of football,\" Ronaldo said.",
      "\"I knew the culture of Saudi football was nice because I had friends who played there before, Portuguese coaches were there.",
      "\"Of course, if you ask me: You expect so quickly for big stars would move there? - No. But, I expected the football would change because of me. I believe in myself, not only in football but in other areas as well.\"",
      "According to multiple report, Al Nassr pay the Portuguese star £173million-a-year. That doesn't just include his salary, as his image rights and commercial deals also contribute to the figure. This vast amount breaks down into £3.6m-a-week, £514,000-a-day, and £21,400-an-hour.",
      "Neymar is reportedly earning in the region of £2.5million-a-week at Al-Hilal, while former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez is said to be on around £750,000 a week at Al-Ahli.",
      "Despite Ronaldo's admittance that the financial terms on offer are an undoubted motivation for moving, he felt little pressure being the first big name to take a leap into the league - something he proved last season as he netted a record-breaking 35 Saudi Pro League goals.",
      "\"To be honest there was zero pressure moving,\" Ronaldo added. \"I didn’t have any pressure. I didn’t feel any pressure. Of course you have other issues. Does it make sense? Will it work out professionally? But to be honest, I felt free.\"",

Although Ugarte will be among friends in his new home, he's proved he can stand his ground single-handedly after seeing how Nunez has coped with significant criticism online.",
      "Showing resilience akin to Liverpool's record signing, 23-year-old Ugarte is ready for the mental challenges of the Premier League. Speaking about the personal attacks players face on social media earlier this summer, Ugarte highlighted Nunez's struggles and how that's influenced his own approach.",

      "Despite making a name for himself in Portuguese football and enhancing his profile at PSG, the midfield maestro is set to face even greater scrutiny at United. But while Ugarte maintains a tough exterior in the court of public opinion, he conceded he's not immune to criticism.",
      "\"I say this with humility, there are people who don't know anything about football and have an opinion, and maybe that comment has a lot of likes and it seems to be 'true,'\" he continued. \"I think it's something I handle quite well; but if something happens to me where everyone kills me, it's not good.\"",

      "Manuel Ugarte's imminent arrival at Manchester United will take their summer spend to £200m, making them stronger to re-establish themselves in the top four - and leaving boss Erik ten Hag with no excuses for falling short",
      "Manuel Ugarte's imminent confirmation as a Manchester United player will take the club's summer transfer spend to around £200million.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his new United football executive team have delivered Erik ten Hag the signings he wanted as he bids to take the club back into the top four of the Premier League.",
      "After last season's worst-ever Premier League finish of eighth, the new regime at United have reacted in the strongest possible way, with Ugarte set to be their fifth summer signing.",
      "The Uruguay midfielder, signed from Paris Saint-Germain, will join Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs De Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui as the latest addition to Ten Hag's improved squad.",
      "United may have stumbled to a fifth successive Premier League defeat to Brighton last weekend, but there is feeling of optimism over the long-term picture following the club's summer business.",
      "Put simply, Ten Hag's squad – with incomings and outgoings – is better equipped to re-establish United as a top-four club and continue the rebuild towards becoming title challengers once again.",
      "But that improvement brings with it expectations, not least on Ten Hag, who knows he can have no excuses for failing to deliver this season after being backed by his bosses in the transfer market.",
      "This summer, Ten Hag has got the players he wanted, two of whom he has worked with previously at Ajax, in De Ligt and Mazraoui, so cannot claim he has not been supported in the strengthening of his personnel.",
      "United's familiar defensive vulnerability may have returned late on to condemn them to a 2-1 defeat at Brighton, but there has been no sense of panic within the club, despite that early setback.",
      "The belief is the arrival of Ugarte will give United greater solidity and security in midfield, allowing Kobbie Mainoo to push further forward, with Yoro – currently injured - De Ligt and Mazraoui offering similar qualities in defence, and Zirkzee bringing a different dimension to the attack, with his ability to drop deep and play in a range of positions across the forward line.",
      "Key to securing the new arrivals – against a backdrop of restricted spending because of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) – has been United's shrewd business when it comes to selling players this summer, something at which they have been lamentable in recent years.",
      "In selling Mason Greenwood, Donny van de Beek, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Facundo Pellistri, Willy Kambwala, Alvaro Fernandez, Hannibal Mejbri and Scott McTominay, United are set to recoup close to £100m, which will go a long way to offsetting their £200m outlay and ensuring they comply with PSR.",
      "Sunday's visit to Old Trafford of arch rivals Liverpool – who have won both of their opening games under new boss Arne Slot – represents another huge test for United and Ten Hag so early in the season. Defeat would increase the pressure on the United boss, who remained in charge, only after the club's hierarchy had interviewed other candidates but ultimately decided to stick with Ten Hag.",
      "United's impressive work at rebuilding their squad with younger players with long-term value is aimed at making the team more consistent in the years ahead, irrespective of who is in charge.",
      "Ten Hag knows as much, which is also why he is acutely aware he cannot afford to fall short in the coming weeks, particularly with former England boss Gareth Southgate, a known favourite of Ineos, waiting in the wings.",

      "\"Sterling not being in the squad was a little eyebrow raiser,\" he told the Daily Mail. \"Everything comes to an end though and he's done all right.\" Jones retired from football in 1998 at the age of 34, with the footballer going on to forge a successful acting career.",
      "And he believes Sterling could follow suit and retire early, adding: \"He scored a few goals, and he might do a job for someone else, but he's had a fantastic career and if I was him I might think about going into something else.",
      "\"He must be financially set up for life. So, go and enjoy life. He's given the sport a lot in terms of England fans and at Liverpool and Man City. He's given a lot of fans a lot of enjoyment over the years and I don't like seeing top players like him drift down through the leagues.",

      "The Tunisia international, who would have struggled for game time at United, has joined the Clarets on a four-year deal worth an initial £5.4million, rising to a potential total fee of £9.4m.",
      "The decent fee helps towards United's compliance with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules, given their current transfer outlay this summer currently stands at £200m, including the £50m arrival of Manuel Ugarte, which could be confirmed later today",
      "But the detail that shows how United have got their act together under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's new football executive team, lead by CEO Omar Berrada and sporting director Dan Ashworth is in the clauses inserted within the Mejbri deal.",
      "As well as the add-ons, which could ultimately total £4m, United have managed to include two key clauses within the deal for Mejbri – an initial 50 per cent sell-on of any future transfer fee Burnley receive for Mejbri, as well as matching rights.",
      "The two clauses show how United, who have struggled to maximise the fees for players they sell on in recent years, have adopted a more clinical and strategic approach to such a key part of of recruitment, particularly with profit and sustainability rules restricting the spending of clubs.",
      "United's new approach to buying and selling stems from the conclusion of the forensic audit undertaken by Ratcliffe's right-hand man, Sir Dave Brailsford, and also overseen by fellow senior Ineos advisors Jean-Claude Blanc and Rob Nevin.",
      "The audit looked at the last five years of player recruitment at United, not just with regard to incomings, but also outgoings, with the club's inability to recoup decent fees – something at which local rivals Manchester City excel – seen as major area for improvement.",
      "The Mejbri deal is one that illustrates United's more ruthless approach to moving players on for significant fees, something the club are also doing with another midfielder, Scott McTominay, who is set to join Napoli before Friday's 11pm transfer deadline.",
      "In addition to Mejbri and McTominay, United have already raised £25.2m from the sale of Mason Greenwood to Marseille, a deal which also included a significant sell-on clause.",

      "With Raheem Sterling potentially heading to Manchester United before the window shuts, one ex-Premier League star thinks Erik ten Hag's attackers will all be thinking the same thing",
      "Troy Deeney believes Manchester United players would be keen to learn from Raheem Sterling if he does arrive from Chelsea.",
      "The ex-England international has been banished by Blues manager Enzo Maresca, who has even taken his No. 7 shirt and given it to new signing Pedro Neto. Sterling, 29, is currently in the wilderness at Cobham, where he is joined by the likes of Ben Chilwell and many others in training away from the first team.",
      "However, Chelsea and United are reportedly in talks to perform a blockbuster swap deal which could see Jadon Sancho and Sterling trade places. While Sancho has agreed a truce with Erik ten Hag after their public fallout last year, the ex-Borussia Dortmund forward has not featured for the Red Devils since he missed the crucial penalty in United's Community Shield loss to Manchester City.",
      "He has been left out of United's squad for the first two matches against Fulham and Brighton and Hove Albion, as Marcus Rashford, Amad Diallo, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and new signing Joshua Zirkzee have been preferred. If Sterling was to join United, ex-Watford captain Deeney believes the United players will all be left thinking the same thing.",
      "Speaking on Sky Sports, Deeney said: \"Those guys will look at Raheem, see that he’s won it at [Manchester] City, see what he’s done at Liverpool, see what he’s done at the international stage and think ‘right, I can learn off that’.”",
      "He also added: \"(Right) now, he’s better than everything they’ve got there. He’d give more of a leadership role to the likes Garnacho and Amad.",
      "\"United fans will probably look at it as an improvement. Because, at the moment when I watch United, I thought they did OK at the weekend. They lacked one or two bits.",
      "\"If they get Luke Shaw back at left-back, that adds a completely different dynamic. And they need a striker, which is why I’m baffled they not going for Ivan Toney.",
      "\"That’d be a quick fix, like the (Robin) van Persie one, you just slot him in and it works. And right now, they need a winger. I don’t think Marcus is delivering. The other guys… Antony’s nothing. I don’t mean that disrespectfully, but they are not offering anything to the level that they should do for a team like Man United.”",
      "United have already spent close to £200million this summer. They are on the cusp of signing Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte for around £52m. He will be the fifth player to arrive at the club after Matthijs de Ligt, Zirkzee, Noussair Mazraoui and 18-year-old central defender Leny Yoro.",
      "United have a tricky test up next off the back of their defeat at Brighton as they host Sterling's former club Liverpool on Sunday. Arne Slot's side have began the campaign faultlessly and will open up a six-point gap on the Red Devils if they overcome them at Old Trafford.",

      "Noel and Liam Gallagher stunned the world this week by announcing Oasis' comeback, but the famous musician has a humble past, which saw him wash a Manchester United star's car",
      "Oasis icon Noel Gallagher may be one of Manchester City's most famous fans, but he once found himself washing a Manchester United legend's car.",
      "Noel, along with his brother Liam, made headlines on Tuesday by announcing that Oasis were to reunite 15 years after the band split up. The Gallaghers are famously two of the mouthiest men in rock and roll. However, according to ex-United forward Brian McClair, Noel didn't even utter a word when, as a young man, he popped round his house.",
      "The songsmith may be one of the UK's most successful, and wealthiest, musicians, but that wasn't always the case. In a far cry from the Champagne Supernova lifestyle Noel later found himself living, McClair revealed that the guitarist and his brother would help out a friend with his car washing service.",
      "Speaking on the Sport Social Network podcast in 2023, the ex-United and Celtic player lifted the lid on the curious tale. He relayed the awkward encounter with Noel and explained just how a future member of rock royalty ended up giving his car a valet – and how he found himself owning a very rare piece of Oasis memorabilia.",
      "According to McClair, Noel became acquainted with the United squad through a man named Paul Ashby, a friend who shared Gallagher's love for Manchester City. Ashby used to wash the City players' cars but then decided to take his business to the red half of the city.",
      "After approaching Sir Alex Ferguson at United's old Cliff training ground, with Paul offering to clean the Red Devils players' vehicles too, he found himself needing a hand. Shortly after building a rapport with the United squad, Paul began to invite the players to his home to get their cars cleaned, and it's there where Liam and Noel began helping him with the valeting service.",
      "McClair told the story of how Noel arrived at his house one day to assist with the cleaning. However to McClair's astonishment, the usually vocal Oasis and High-Flying Birds star barley uttered a single word.",
      "McClair said: \"Noel came to the house one day to clean the car and he never said a f***ing word.\" The show's host was shocked and interjected: \"That's not like him is it?\" Which prompted McClair to respond: \"Not a thing, that's what I'm saying.\"",
      "Despite Noel's silence, he did accept McClair's wife's offer of coffee and chocolate biscuits. McClair added: \"Then the missus made him a coffee, and brought out some chocolate biscuits.\" That included Penguins and a few other household favourites such as Gold Bars and Blue Ribbands.",
      "Some might say Noel was underpaid – but he didn't seem to mind as McClair recalls him being polite while he was at his house. However, he recalled that sharing his gratitude was the only time Noel opened his mouth. The 60-year-old said: \"He said thanks for that but that's all he said in the 45 mins to an hour period he was there.\"",
      "In an amazing twist, McClair revealed he received a priceless nice parting gift – an early Oasis demo tape that he still has to this day. The former Scotland international also recalls how he was impressed with what he heard, adding: \"Paul gave me a demo of Oasis, and I said to him, 'ah it's pretty good that'. I've still got it, it's a copy of the original of them doing their early songs.\"",
      "McClair enjoyed a trophy-laden spell with Motherwell, Celtic and United. He scored 202 goals in that time and retired from the game in 1999.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Andreas Pereira previously opened up on how he avoided Erik ten Hag to seal a move away from the club",
      "Andreas Pereira previously admitted that he dodged Erik ten Hag to seal his Manchester United exit after feeling 'unloved' at the club.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder left Old Trafford in the summer of 2022 after loan spells at Valencia, Granada, Lazio and Flamengo to join Premier League side Fulham for £8million.",
      "Despite question marks surrounding his future potential, the 28-year-old has cemented a starting place in the Fulham line-up, making 23 goal contributions in 84 total appearances - and had even reportedly caught the eye of Chelsea this summer with his performances for the Cottagers.",
      "Speaking earlier this year, the Brazilian admitted that he refused to talk to Ten Hag - who had coached him at PSV - in order to push through a move away from Manchester so he could play regular first-team football. The Dutchman had just been appointed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's permanent successor when Pereira was returning from his fourth loan spell away from the club.",
      "Ten Hag was still assessing his squad when Pereira took the decision away from him by angling for a transfer, fearing he'd only be a bit-part player.",
      "He told Vibe with Five: \"This was when I came back to England [after my loan in Brazil]. Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old. Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, ‘Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you’re going to play in the first team’. But I’d just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, ‘I’m going to United’.",
      "\"That’s why I didn’t want to speak to Erik because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, ‘Andreas, stay here. You’re not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you’ll be around the squad’. That’s not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "The midfielder, who made just 75 appearances for United despite coming through the club's youth ranks in 2014, admitted he had reservations about leaving the Red Devils but took the plunge to return to Brazil where he could earn the 'love' he deserved.",
      "Pereira said: \"Leaving United, you’re like, ‘Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?’ In the end, you’re never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave.",
      "\"I wanted to play, after COVID, I wanted to play. I was going crazy, wanting to play in the Premier League. I wanted to show that I was good enough, I was very close to joining Everton and suddenly my father called me and said, ‘Andreas, you never played in Brazil, you’re Brazilian’.",
      "\"I was like, ‘Where do we go then?’ The president of Flamengo jokingly called my dad and said, ‘If he wants to come, he can come’. Everyone at United said, ‘You’re crazy, you’ll stay in Brazil, you’ll never come back to Europe’. Everyone in my family wanted me to come [to Brazil] but they were like, ‘No, what are you doing?’",

      "\"I wanted to play in Brazil and want to feel loved. I didn’t feel the love that I thought I should get. I wanted to feel loved by my own people, play close to my family and enjoy football.\"",
      "Pereira has been the subject of interest during this transfer window, emerging as a target for Chelsea at the beginning of the summer. Brazilian outlet Globo reported that the 28-year-old was the first choice to replace Conor Gallagher at one point - and the player's agent had an asking price of between £30-35m.",

      "Manchester United and Chelsea are holding talks over a sensational swap deal involving Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho, with both players having fallen out of favour at their clubs",
      "Peter Beardsley is the only player to have worn the shirts of Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City - so Raheem Sterling would be following in hallowed footsteps should he get to realise his childhood dream of moving to Old Trafford.",
      "‌Sterling has been told in no uncertain terms that he is surplus to requirements at Chelsea - and with Jadon Sancho still out in the cold in Manchester despite agreeing a truce with United boss Erik ten Hag, it has been suggested that a swap deal makes sense for both clubs.",
      "Ironically, Sterling has confessed to being a United fan when he was growing up in Wembley, while Sancho loved the Chelsea team of Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard when he was a boy in South London.",
      "‌But while the notion of the two former England team-mates trading places has a nice whiff of romance about it, for both Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Todd Boehly any deal will come down purely to the bottom line.",
      "It might take Sterling some time to win over the United fans given his past at Anfield and the Etihad. But given Ratcliffe has already taken chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox from City, it appears local rivalries aren't being allowed to get in the way of business.",
      "‌The fact that Sterling has failed to score in any of his 26 games against United for Liverpool, City or Chelsea might also help his cause! United’s first two games of the Premier League season has seen Ten Hag ask Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount rotate in the role of deep-lying striker.",
      "It’s fair to say, the plan hasn’t got the best out of either midfielder. It was only when Joshua Zirkzee came off the bench to score the winner against Fulham that United started to really threaten.‌",
      "And in the 2-1 defeat at Brighton on Saturday, both players were substituted. United have got no shortage of talent in the wide areas, with Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad Diallo. Don’t forget, Ten Hag also has £95million winger Antony at his disposal.",
      "‌But Sterling showed during his prime years under Pep Guardiola that he has the kind of versatility that Ten Hag needs. The 29-year-old operated on both flanks under the City boss, sometimes being asked to hold his position out wide to stretch opponents and in other games being used as an inverted winger with the freedom to cut inside.",
      "‌It could even be argued that Sterling was at his very best when he was deployed in the ‘false nine’ position that is currently proving such a conundrum for Ten Hag while striker Rasmus Hojlund is injured.",
      "In Guardiola’s first season at the Etihad, he managed just 10 goals. As he continued to develop his game under the Catalan, those numbers leapt to 23, 25 and 31 in the next three seasons. Even in Sterling’s final year at City, when it became clear he would be leaving, he managed to find the net 17 times.",
      "That kind of adaptability and goal threat is just what Ten Hag needs right now - and a swap deal that includes Sancho would also enable the United boss to find a cure for one of his biggest headaches.",
      "‌Where Sancho fits in at Stamford Bridge is another matter given the sheer number of players that they are trying to sell. But what is clear is that the 24-year-old needs a clean break from United - despite the poorly disguised PR attempt to mend his relationship with Ten Hag.",

      "Phil Neville and a Ferrari don't belong in the same sentence - hence the reaction his Manchester United team-mates had when he arrived at training behind the wheel of one",
      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed the Manchester United squad's reaction to Phil Neville turning up to training in a flashy Ferrari.",
      "Neville's decision to show off quickly backfired. The full-back caught his team-mates off guard as he pulled up in his new supercar, a not-so-common sight during Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary reign.",
      "And they soon let him know their thoughts on the matter, as Ferdinand recalled on his podcast Rio Presents. The Red Devils legend said: \"I remember Phil Neville turned up in a Ferrari once. Phil Neville. The Neville should not turn up anywhere in a Ferrari, alright?",
      "\"He turned up in a Ferrari once and his car got smashed with balls, like 10, 15, 20 yards away. Lads were banging balls at it, kicking balls up in the sky for it to drop on the car. Like, 'what are you doing?' That's just a subtle way of saying, 'sell that car, now'.\"",
      "Ferdinand had been discussing United's potential signing of Ronaldinho alongside the club's former chief executive Peter Kenyon, who explained how he could've arrived in the summer of 2003 as well as a young Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "After talks with United, the Brazilian icon instead left PSG to join Barcelona. Kenyon feels that ultimately worked out positively for United, who weren't used to making signings of that ilk.",
      "He told Ferdinand: \"I think on reflection we did better without him, because coming back to culture, to what Manchester United was, it was a special team, a special environment. Ok people went out, but they didn't party every night, they didn't come to training late.",
      "\"United was bigger than any player in the world at that stage. We had conversations, Alex and I - United was so special, the best player in the world couldn't necessarily just walk onto Old Trafford and play.\"",
      "Kenyon pointed out a shift in transfer approach from the days of Fergie's tenure, with Ferdinand agreeing. \"I think that's part of the problem today,\" the 70-year-old continued.",
      "\"It's not about the best players are the ones you pay more money for or you pay more wages. That doesn't mean they're the best player for you. Every time an agent rings me, 'I've got the best left-back'. Well, he might be, but he might not be the best left-back for us. And the best teams work that out.\"",

      "The Brazilian was outstanding in his first season at United but shocking in his second year. Ugarte is a mobile defensive midfielder, he will recover and intercept balls and is expected to start in front of the backline with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes playing ahead of him.",
      "United have splashed €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons to sign Ugarte and he arrived in Manchester on Tuesday to undergo his medical and finalise his move.",
      "Fresh legs were required in United's midfield and the club believe their deal with PSG has shown their patient approach to the negotiations in this summer window has worked.",
      "The signing of Ugarte is better later than never and he is expected to be available for selection against Liverpool on Sunday afternoon. Casemiro started the opening games of the season against Fulham and Brighton but he will now have to fight to retain his starting role.",
      "Casemiro didn't spectacularly regress last season due to complacency, he merely looked like a player who had helplessly entered the winter of his career, which was sad to see, but perhaps Ugarte's arrival will provide him with the spark he needs to recapture his best form.",
      "The 2022/23 version of Casemiro might never be seen again, but Ugarte's transfer could coax improvement out of the 32-year-old, who will not want to start games on the bench.",
      "Casemiro has enjoyed a magnificent career, winning every trophy club football has to offer, and will be offended to be included on the bench this season, regardless of his decline.",
      "That is what Erik ten Hag wants - he would be concerned if a player wasn't aggrieved to be named on the bench. Casemiro must channel any frustration into producing better performances and his anticipated competition with Ugarte can only be positive news for United.",
      "Of course, it's possible that Casemiro and Ugarte could play together, but that would mean dropping the excellent Mainoo and he should be one of the first names on the team sheet.",
      "A high-placed source at United conceded Ten Hag was forced to overplay Mainoo last season. The youngster was asked to do a lot after his return from an ankle injury and he will benefit from being rotated in some matches, but he should start most Premier League games.",
      "Fernandes is the captain and he will obviously not be rested. He is the most influential player in the squad and has been the most consistent performer since signing in January 2020.",

      "He seems to have a hidden magnet in his head to attract the ball when United take set-pieces and has been involved in intricate play around the box, although there are still doubts about the protection he provides to the backline and that's ultimately his biggest responsibility.",

      "Manuel Ugarte is set to undergo his medical today before finalising his £42.3m transfer to Manchester United, having flown into the city late on Tuesday.",
      "The 23-year-old landed at Manchester Airport just before 10pm last night, flying on a private jet from Paris after United agreed a fee with Paris Saint-Germain to end their summer-long pursuit. United will pay an initial €50m, with a further €10m in add-ons.",
      "Now he has arrived in Manchester Ugarte is expected to complete the formalities of his move today. The Uruguay international has set his sights on a switch to Old Trafford throughout the summer and he has been United's top target for the holding midfield position.",
      "Ugarte will need to be registered with the Premier League before midday on Friday to be in contention to feature against Liverpool on Sunday, although he hasn't played for Paris Saint-Germain since the Copa America, having been left out of their matchday squad for their first two Ligue 1 fixtures of the season.",
      "United are pleased with the deal they have struck for Ugarte, with PSG holding firm on a demand for a fixed fee of €60m until a fresh round of negotiations late last week.",
      "Ugarte made the Copa America Best XI at this summer's tournament in the United States, which further enhanced United's view of him as one of the best young midfielders in the game.",

      "Three years ago Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho were in the England squad that came within in a penalty shoot-out of winning a major tournament. Sancho was 21, Rashford 23 and Sterling 26 and they looked to be part of a bright future.",
      "Now, they all find themselves at something of a crossroads. Back then, Sancho was heading for a return to the Premier League after an electric spell at Borussia Dortmund, Rashford had just had a second successive 20-goal season and Sterling was a key part of Manchester City's title winners.",
      "In elite-level football, life can come at you fast. Now aged between 24 and 29, all three should be at their peak, but none of them made the cut for England's Euro 2024 squad. Sancho and Sterling find themselves out of the picture at Manchester United and Chelsea respectively and while Rashford's situation is perhaps the most secure for now, his status at his boyhood club is hanging by a thread.",
      "One solution to Sancho and Sterling's predicaments at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge is a swap deal, something the clubs have discussed this week, with the clock ticking towards Friday's deadline. United want to get rid of Sancho, who is surplus to requirements, while Chelsea are desperate to get rid of Sterling's wages.",
      "If it comes off, and it's still probably more unlikely than likely at this stage, it would be a move of convenience. Sancho's days are numbered at United because of his falling out with Erik ten Hag last season and the absence of trust within that relationship, but also because United have four wingers to cover two positions. Adding Sterling into that mix isn't necessary from a squad-building point of view, but could be considered opportune.",
      "The 29-year-old has 123 career goals in the Premier League for Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. He is a big-game player with plenty of experience and could certainly add something to the dressing room at Old Trafford. While Sancho has little chance of making a matchday squad at the moment, Sterling would expect to feature. It would complicate selection decisions for Ten Hag going forward, especially if he intends to leave a winger out every week.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has started the first three games on the bench but would expect to be in the team soon. Amad has leapfrogged Antony on the right and the Brazilian's future next summer must be in doubt.",
      "Sterling can play on the left and the right, but is better on the left and having often competed with Rashford at international level, that rivalry could be renewed at Carrington. A swap deal involving Sterling and Sancho might solve short-term problems for both players, but could also make life more difficult for Rashford.",
      "This has felt like a make-or-break season for the academy graduate and although he's started the first three games, the campaign hasn't begun as he would have hoped. He was taken off after 65 minutes against Brighton and is already coming under pressure for his place. On merit, Garnacho deserves to start against Liverpool this weekend, but Rashford's stellar record against those opponents might hand him another chance.",
      "Rashford managed just eight goals last season and his status as one of the highest earners in the squad after signing a new five-year deal in July 2023 is a problem if his level doesn't improve. His off-field indiscretions also frustrated Ten Hag last season.",
      "Long-term, it's hard to see how Rashford and Sterling co-exist in a squad that also includes Garnacho. The Argentine has started to look productive on the right but feels his long-term future is on the left.",
      "If this deal does come off before Friday, Sterling might consider it good news and an unexpected opportunity at a club bigger than Chelsea. For Rashford, it will only add to his concerns about his future. If he ends up below his former England colleague in Ten Hag's thoughts, then his future could become a major issue during the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "Rashford's status as the academy's poster boy has diminished recently and his relationship with supporters has frayed. For much of last season, it looked like a parting of the ways might suit every party. But actually going ahead with that is a decision both club and player would take reluctantly. Once those ties are severed they can't be reconnected, but adding more competition in his position could push things in that direction.",
      "Sancho, Rashford and Sterling should all be at their best at this stage of their careers. Instead, the future for all three is uncertain and intertwined.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "Raheem Sterling will not be able to claim his favoured No.7 shirt at Manchester United if he completes a surprising move to Old Trafford. However, there's one sentimental option that might take his fancy.",
      "Sterling has emerged as a late target for United this summer after being unceremoniously cast aside by Chelsea in the final stages of the transfer window. United have held exploratory discussions on a potential swoop, while they are now seemingly involved in a three-way transfer triangle involving Chelsea and Juventus.",
      "Juventus and Chelsea both want Jadon Sancho and a swap deal involving the United forward and Sterling has also been mooted. Well-placed sources expect the parties involved will reassess that proposal, with enough time to get business rubber-stamped before 11pm comes and goes on Friday night.",
      "Sterling is certainly no stranger to the north west. The 29-year-old spent five years at Liverpool between 2010 and 2015 after leaving QPR, while the 82-cap England star went on to win ten major honours with Manchester City in a seven-year haul which included four Premier League medals under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Despite those connections, it would be a dream come true for Sterling to play for United as he grew up in London supporting the Old Trafford giants. However, while he might have initially wanted to take the No.7 shirt he wore for City, that particular shirt number is not available to him.",
      "Mason Mount, who incidentally took the direct route from Stamford Bridge to United himself last summer, has the iconic No.7 to his name. Sterling's other previous choices are also predominately taken.",
      "No.13, No.19, No.26, No.27, No.28, No.29 and No.30 among the shirt numbers yet to be assigned this season. Sterling, or other potential signings, also have several alternatives in the 30s and 40s.",
      "However, the one that might really catch his eye is No.31, which the forward donned throughout his five-year spell with United's bitter rivals Liverpool. That was last 'owned' by former loan goalkeeper Jack Butland.",

      "The idea was to sign Harry Kane or a striker of a similar ilk and Hojlund but United could only get one deal done. Couple this with Anthony Martial's injury woes and suddenly the Dane was the club's only recognised striker.",

You could even argue that Hojlund's figures are more impressive considering the extenuating circumstances at the club compared to the 2008/09 season.",

      "Scott McTominay could undergo a medical in Naples today as he edges closer to completing a £25m move to Serie A side Napoli.",
      "The Manchester United midfielder is set to travel to Italy to finalise a transfer that would see him end his 22-year association with his boyhood club, with the two clubs agreeing a fixed fee for the 27-year-old.",
      "McTominay is attracted by the idea of a new challenge at a club that won the Serie A title in 2022/23 and enjoy significant support. The Scotland international is also keen on the idea of playing in a new league and Napoli boss Antonio Conte had hoped to land him.",
      "United were reluctant to lose their academy graduate, having rejected a £30m offer from West Ham for him last August, before he then went on to enjoy his best season at the club, scoring 10 times last season.",
      "But a combination of McTominay's desire to play regularly and the attraction of selling academy players under the Premier League's financial rules has led to them agreeing a deal with Napoli, having turned down an offer from Fulham earlier in the window.",
      "McTominay has come off the bench in all three of United's competitive games so far this season and although he started the FA Cup final in May, there was an expectation he would have to settle for a bit-part role this season.",
      "United had been unable to sell Casemiro, having considered offloading the Brazilian earlier in the window, and the impending arrival of Manuel Ugarte, coupled with the return to form and fitness of Mason Mount, had left McTominay on the fringes and United were unable to guarantee him the starting position he wanted.",
      "The Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) also incentivise the sale of academy players, who go down as pure profit in the books for the financial year. That makes a £25m fee for McTominay more attractive and his departure will help fund the £42.3m move for Ugarte, who is set for his United medical on Tuesday.",
      "McTominay will leave United after 253 appearances, scoring 29 goals and winning the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window has largely been a success. Things can change quickly entering the final days of the month but Ineos' first big task has so far been bypassed without too much of a hitch.",
      "The early chase for Jarrad Branthwaite didn't descend into saga-like chaos as has been the case previously (see Frenkie de Jong), and despite Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui both taking a bit longer than would have been ideal, two key additions were made. Joshua Zirkzee already looks like a good piece of business for the £35million he cost.",
      "United have recouped some fees back as well, already overtaking their total incomings from last year with the promise of at least one more high (ish) profile exit. In fact, it was 2019 when the club last made this much back from a single summer and that was headlined by Romelu Lukaku.",
      "Should Scott McTominay depart then there's every chance the 2024 window overtakes that. Only the repair job of 2015 and Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid move in 2009 will then be ahead of it. Erik ten Hag may well hope that this year can go the extra step though as it will mean Victor Lindelof is also off the books.",
      "The same is true of Jadon Sancho. A permanent deal away from Old Trafford for him would seal the most lavish selling spree in the club's history. Meanwhile, they have addressed the problem areas in the squad without being tempted by walking red flags and agent offers.",
      "Although Manuel Ugarte carries with him some doubts over mobility and the impact of passing, signing a new midfielder was paramount. What United are getting after a transfer was agreed is exactly what Ten Hag has been after: an anchor to break up and disrupt play. Give the ball to Kobbie Mainoo and move on.",
      "As long as the club doesn't get tempted at the last minute to ditch their well-thought-out summer plans in favour of Raheem Sterling, a quietly impressive window is on the cards. What is needed after Ugarte to complete this though?",
      "Here, Manchester Evening News writers give their thoughts.",
      "On Monday I wrote that it wouldn't surprise me if United did actually go for the Sterling-Sancho swap. Perhaps that was being disingenuous to what Dan Ashworth and Co have actually been working towards this window. United's business hasn't been seamless, it hasn't been quiet, but it has been refreshingly different to past years.",
      "Sterling is nothing United need, especially not in place of Sancho. Really, the less we hear about the Red Devils this week, the better. It really should be just sales and locking up.",
      "McTominay out, fine. For £25million United definitely could have gotten more, and there's a good argument that with European football to come he has a role to play. The decision has been taken to sell him though and getting it over the line rather than running things down too much is a good idea.",
      "Selling Lindelof will be harder. Where is the interest in an ageing defender who has 12 months on his contract and is totally out of favour? If it's not a move to Turkey then really, nobody is going to pay decent money for him.",
      "Sancho is the one to look out for. All parties appear to want the same thing here but getting as close to a permanent resolution as possible would be an achievement. The last thing anyone wants is to be back in this loan-sale purgatory next summer. Take £30million and run.",
      "Ugarte looks to be a sensible signing for United and one which should fix an obvious problem in Ten Hag's squad. The Uruguayan is a younger and more mobile version of Casemiro and should be able to provide a greater platform for Kobbie Mainoo to flourish going forward.",
      "But if a deal cannot be struck to sign Brentford striker Ivan Toney, then the 23-year-old should be United's final summer signing. The priority needs to be getting rid of players who are well past their sell-by date at United - mainly Jadon Sancho and Victor Lindelof.",
      "Selling the Swedish defender may be more difficult due to his injury, however, Sancho clearly has no future at Old Trafford and him staying in Manchester is only going to hurt Ten Hag's team. Overall though it's been a pretty good transfer window for United.",
      "United's signings this summer have made it clear they want to fight for a place in the top four after last season's disappointing eighth-place finish. Their persistence in securing the services of Manuel Ugarte shows just that.",
      "With Ugarte on his way to Old Trafford and the likes of McTominay and Hannibal Mejbri on their way out, United's next focus should be to cash in on Sancho. I struggle to see he has any future at the club despite resolving his differences with Erik ten Hag.",
      "There are some clubs interested in sealing his signature, and I think United should take any good offer that comes their way. Having not played in the first two games of the season, his value could decrease significantly between now and January if he doesn't get minutes throughout the season. It could become increasingly difficult to get a good fee for him.",
      "With the central midfielder box ticked, if you are a United fan the heart would be wanting to make the next transfer an addition to the attack - preferably a centre-forward. However, realistically the next transfer now needs to be a departure.",
      "Mejbri is on the way out but it now seems time to allow Scott McTominay to go. Rio Ferdinand voiced his concerns about the transfer this week and it is understandable.",
      "At the same time, the Reds have an abundance of central midfielders and if Casemiro cannot be sold someone like McTominay was always going to be on the chopping block. The pressure though is ramped up on Erik ten Hag with this strategy considering he is choosing to back Mason Mount to come good instead of a academy graduate.",
      "Only time will tell if this is the right call or not but I think the Scottish international's sale will be next on the agenda for the Reds.",
      "When you look at United's summer transfer business, they have virtually strengthened in every area they needed to apart from one. Erik ten Hag has signed two new centre-backs, a centre forward and a right-back - and is on the verge of signing a new central midfielder in the form of Manuel Ugarte.",
      "I feel that United are a left-back away from a near-perfect window on the incoming front. They desperately need to add a new one to the squad with Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia unreliable due to their damning injury records. Now, deciding which one United should target is the tricky question.",
      "Ben Chilwell does look an obvious option with his Chelsea future uncertain, but United should avoid that one as he has struggled with injuries over the years. Instead, I would suggest Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez. He has been impressive since arriving in the Premier League, and although he would fix the short-term need, he would provide a longer term requirement in that role.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands that United are only realistically looking to bring in one more player - Manuel Ugarte. While Scott McTominay, Hannibal Mejbri and Jadon Sancho could all leave, the club seem unlikely to spend again this window.",
      "However, if there was one area they could look at, it is at left-back where Luke Shaw is once again injured and Tyrell Malacia is still to return from last summer’s knee operation. A loan deal for an unwanted player is probably more likely than, say, a Ben Chilwell purchase.",
      "The question is whether anyone of that ilk would be worth bringing in given the covering Diogo Dalot, a right-back, has provided astute displays in the role when Shaw and Malacia might be back before long. But then, United fans heard that line last season...",

      "The summer transfer window is almost over as clubs work to do any last-minute deals. And it will be no different at Manchester United.",
      "The window closes at 11pm on Friday, 30 August. For United, they could be looking to add to the four incoming deals that they have already completed so far this summer and eyes will also be on possible outgoings as Erik ten Hag continues to shape his squad.",
      "With the end of the window coming into view, there’s no surprise that there is a lot of talk over deals that may or may not happen over the next few days. With that in mind, MEN Sport have taken a look at some of the stories over the last 24 hours and given our own view on the situation.",
      "Manchester United have opened talks with Chelsea over a possible move for Raheem Sterling. It comes with Chelsea reportedly showing an interest in Jadon Sancho, who is expected to leave United before the end of the window.",
      "It has been reported that Chelsea have been keen on a potential swap deal that involves both players. Sterling is also expected to leave Chelsea before the deadline after being left out of the matchday squad for the opening two games of the season.",
      "One problem on a potential swap deal is Sterling’s wages, which are reportedly £325,000-a-week. If the swap deal happens and that isn’t reduced, it would leave United worse off in terms of the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs).",
      "MEN Sport says: On the face of it, a swap deal involving both Sancho and Sterling does make sense. Both teams allow a player who they want to leave out of the door, while both players also get a good move themselves.",
      "But there are a few things that need to happen for a deal to happen, most notably surrounding the players’ wages. United are also in talks with Juventus over a possible deal for Sancho.",
      "That may be an easier one to do before the deadline. It would also be a boost in terms of PSR.",
      "Manuel Ugarte is closing in on a deal to join United after weeks of negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain. The midfielder now looks set to arrive at Old Trafford after a deal was agreed between the two clubs.",
      "MEN Sport understands United will pay a fee of €50 million (£42.2m) plus €10 million (£8.4m) in add-ons. Ben Jacobs claims PSG will also have a sell on clause of 10 percent.",
      "MEN Sport says: United have been working on a deal to bring Ugarte to the club for some time, so they will be happy to get an agreement sorted. The price is significantly lower than what PSG were originally asking, with United initially walking away from the deal paying off.",
      "Including a sell-on clause may not be ideal if and when the club come to cash in on the player anytime in the future. It’s a clever way of adding an extra layer to the deal for the selling club without immediate financial outlay, which is a positive regarding PSR.",

Any swap deal is likely to have to see both players reduce their wages for a transfer to go ahead, but if that can be sorted, then it could be an ideal scenario for all parties.",
      "Both players and clubs find themselves in a similar situation with a transfer away from their current sides probably the best outcome. Sterling has been forced to train away from the Chelsea first team after falling out of favour under new head coach Enzo Maresca.",
      "A swap deal would also see both players join the team that they grew up supporting. Back in the summer of 2021, Sancho revealed how he was a Chelsea fan as a child.",
      "He told talkSPORT before Euro 2020: “England hero? I'd probably say Frank Lampard. I was a Chelsea fan growing up, I'm not gonna lie! Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard were my favourite players at the time.",

Whilst there are some doubts over Ugarte's passing ability, the technical quality within United's best-starting line-up should make up for that.",

      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",

      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",

He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",

If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United's willingness to sell McTominay last year went down badly with his family members, for whom watching McTominay has become their predominant pastime in the past seven years. McTominay's father, Frank, has travelled on European aways with Harry Maguire's and Luke Shaw's parents while McTominay's girlfriend, Cameron, was in the United States for last month's pre-season tour.",
      "McTominay skipped the mixed zone in San Diego, as is his wont, but lingered to high-five Tom Heaton's sons and say hello to his family who followed United from Los Angeles to South Carolina. United will soon be an academy graduate lighter.",
      "The Premier League must amend the profitability and sustainability rules to deincentivise selling academy graduates. Chelsea's torrid treatment has not stopped at Conor Gallagher. Trevoh Chalobah is another outcast.",
      "United are poor sellers and McTominay is a sellable asset. Even after his pivotal performances in a career-best campaign that ended with a start in the FA Cup final, United have not hesitated in welcoming prospective buyers to their stall.",
      "United were prepared to sell McTominay last year and should have accepted the £30million West Ham United offered. McTominay was inexplicably valued at £40m, despite starting 16 games out of 62 in the 2022-23 season. He will be sold for just over £25m.",
      "His future at United was safeguarded by Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury in late July last year. It is to McTominay's immense credit he rallied to score ten big goals and help salvage the season against Manchester City at Wembley, where he was the glue between United's midfield and attack.",
      "McTominay can be a prickly character. Club sources say he has a \"distrust of the media\" and McTominay once embraced a reporter who has a tendency to ask soft questions. He represented the club impassionately in an unfiltered post-match interview at Arsenal in April 2022 and ahead of their Champions League elimination by Bayern Munich last year.",
      "Few players looked as crestfallen as McTominay as he skulked towards the exit after the 4-0 evisceration by Brighton in May 2022. He was tightly-wound after victory at Southampton later that year, still bristling over recent criticism. He used that as fuel in his formative years in the first team by searching his name on Twitter.",
      "His mentality and attitude shame some who will remain at United beyond the closure of the transfer window. A jealous teammate privately dubbed McTominay a \"teacher's pet\" due to his penchant for endearing himself to a new manager. McTominay occupied a key role in the teams of Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.",
      "But McTominay is not aligned with the game model - the new buzzphrase at United - that the club have settled on. McTominay's functions are limited to tackle, kick ball, head ball, score goal. He is adept at all four.",
      "United want technicians and for their style to remain consistent whoever comes in. Replacing Bruno Fernandes with McTominay at Brighton was a win-or-bust move. United lost control and lost the game.",
      "McTominay has to be sold for Manuel Ugarte to be bought. One is an attacking midfielder and the other a defensive midfielder. The latter position is an utmost priority in a squad where the cumbersome Casemiro is the only sentry. The back four needs a force-field of a shield and Ugarte redresses the balance.",
      "It is regrettable that McTominay is going ahead of Casemiro, with no room at the Saudi retirement inn, or Christian Eriksen, who has about as much matchday involvement as a mascot.",
      "Eriksen will be released next year and Casemiro should be easier to shift. Then United have the leverage and the finances to complete their midfield overhaul. Ten Hag is also intimately invested in Toby Collyer's development.",
      "There is not one outgoing at United this summer that should be missed. They released five senior players two years ago and no United supporter who is sound of mind has ever mused, \"We could have done with Pogba today.\"",
      "A generation of United fans have grown up so accustomed to the club's mediocrity and inability to proactively sell players they are remorseful at such players' departures. The aspiration for United has to be to regain the Premier League crown. They came eighth last season. A squad cull was essential.",
      "McTominay has been embedded in the senior squad for seven years. Aaron Wan-Bissaka had five years. Neither outstayed their welcome but this is the time to move on. Under the old bean-counter regime, they would have been tied down on five-year contracts.",
      "United have committed to investing £206.06m in their five signings this summer. With McTominay's imminent sale of £25.37m, the club have negotiated outgoings rising to £95.49m.",
      "They have moved on from the unedifying two-and-a-half-year Mason Greenwood saga, they are free of a right back Solskjaer looked at replacing three years ago, obtained a fine fee for an injury-prone defender in Willy Kambwala, Donny van de Beek was a worse Dutchman than Alexander Buttner, Facundo Pellistri and Hannibal Mejbri failed their auditions, there was no pathway for Alvaro Fernandez and treatment table regular Anthony Martial is no longer siphoning off the wage bill.",
      "Jadon Sancho wants out of United and United want Sancho out. That is doable this week with Juventus firmly interested. It is in all parties' interests for Sancho to go after three flaky and feckless years.",

      "Sources described 'wide interest' in both loan and permanent transfers for Hannibal last summer, but the decision was taken to keep him around Erik ten Hag's squad following a promising loan spell with Birmingham in 2022-23 that saw the Tunisian make 41 appearances in all competitions.",

      "As one new face arrived at Carrington, another was saying an emotional goodbye. Manuel Ugarte has had eyes only for Manchester United throughout this summer window, but to make room for his arrival United had to end a relationship that has sustained for 22 years.",
      "Scott McTominay is now 27 but since he was five Manchester United is all he has known when it comes to club football. Perhaps reaching 253 club appearances and having the kind of career he has had so far says more about his mentality than his ability.",
      "While a galaxy of expensive recruits have flopped under Old Trafford's harsh spotlight, McTominay has proven himself to be at times invaluable to a succession of managers. The fact Jose Mourinho took such a shine to him has made more sense as his career has gone on and the Scotland international wrung every last drop out of his talent to sustain his status at United.",
      "Even now, his departure is partly being forced by the Premier League's spending rules, which incentivise selling academy graduates. That made Napoli's £25m bid appealing when United were looking to raise funds to sign Ugarte for an initial £42.3m.",
      "The time might be right for McTominay to move on, however. He had an excellent season last term, but can't be guaranteed minutes in a competitive area of the team under Erik ten Hag. At 27, a search for more regular first-team football makes sense.",
      "McTominay's exit sees another familiar face heading for the exit, however, and as Ten Hag nears the end of his third transfer window the transformation of his squad is almost complete. As things stand, if the Dutchman is credited for the emergence and rise of Kobbie Mainoo and Amad (as he should be), and Alejandro Garnacho (maybe a little more contentious), then only seven senior first-team players remain from the squad Ten Hag inherited.",
      "Of those, two more could have gone during this window and one may still do. United had planned to sell Victor Lindelof but for a toe injury to put paid to that and he will be utilised as defensive cover in the final year of his contract.",
      "Then there is Jadon Sancho, who continues to attract interest from Juventus and would be surplus to requirements under Ten Hag's desire to have two options for every position this season. United have an excess of wingers, even if there are questions over the form of Marcus Rashford and Antony at the moment.",
      "The truce between Ten Hag and Sancho feels uneasy and has done ever since they agreed to try and bury the hatchet in July. Sancho hasn't made a Premier League matchday squad so far this season and if he stays that probably won't change at the weekend.",
      "Ten Hag would surely benefit from Sancho leaving. He would have no questions about the professionalism and commitment of Lindelof to get through a season as a bit-part player, but we already know he will have concerns about Sancho's ability and desire to adapt to a minor role.",
      "Trimming his wages from the squad would also be beneficial and if that is the final deal United do this summer (once the transfers involving Ugarte and McTominay are confirmed) then it will have to go down as a good window.",
      "It would certainly give Ten Hag a squad that he can more than call his own. Of the players to have survived his cull, Tom Heaton is the third-choice goalkeeper and a valuable dressing room presence, while Harry Maguire is likely to end up as fourth-choice centre-back once everyone is fit.",
      "Luke Shaw would return to the team if he can stay fit enough for long enough, while Bruno Fernandes is clearly the most important of those players from the pre-Ten Hag era. Rashford has a fight on his hands to keep his place on the team.",
      "Of the primary squad Ten Hag will be utilising this season, 18 are either his signings or have mostly developed under him. He is the manager who has finally started to play Amad, while he deserves real credit for his faith in Mainoo. Garnacho's talent wasn't a secret when he was appointed, but he has gone to another level under the Dutchman.",
      "In three summer transfer windows, Ten Hag has shaped this squad in his image. Ineos will feel there is more work to be done, that there are areas that can still be improved, probably at full-back and in forward areas, but after this week's transfers, this more than ever before is a Ten Hag squad.",

      "The younger Neville brother was soon made to regret that decision when his team-mates reacted in brutal fashion. He was far from the flashiest member of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad.",
      "And that's why Ferdinand, who played alongside him for three seasons, and Co couldn't believe their eyes when he drove in behind the wheel of his supercar. Speaking on his podcast Rio Presents, the former centre-back said: \"I remember Phil Neville turned up in a Ferrari once.",
      "\"Phil Neville. The Neville should not turn up anywhere in a Ferrari, alright? He turned up in a Ferrari once and his car got smashed with balls, like 10, 15, 20 yards away.",

      "Kenyon explained how United could well have signed both him and Cristiano Ronaldo in the same summer window. But he thinks it could've rocked the boat in a damaging manner.",
      "The 70-year-old said: \"I think on reflection we did better without him, because coming back to culture, to what Manchester United was, it was a special team, a special environment. Ok people went out, but they didn't party every night, they didn't come to training late.",
      "\"United was bigger than any player in the world at that stage. We had conversations, Alex and I – United was so special, the best player in the world couldn't necessarily just walk onto Old Trafford and play.\"",
      "Kenyon suggested it's that mentality which has largely been lost since the days of Fergie's legendary reign, with Ferdinand agreeing with him. \"I think that's part of the problem today,\" he continued.",
      "\"It's not about the best players are the ones you pay more money for or you pay more wages. That doesn't mean they're the best player for you. Every time an agent rings me, 'I've got the best left-back' – well, he might be, but he might not be the best left-back for us. And the best teams work that out.\"",

      "Manchester United are hopeful that loans can be agreed for Sonny Aljofree and Elyh Harrison before the transfer deadline.",
      "Aljofree, 19, and goalkeeper Harrison, 18, have both been identified as young players who would benefit from a loan spell and movement is anticipated before the window shuts.",
      "Clubs who sign United's youngsters on loan must pitch their development plan for the player and talks are progressing for loan moves for both Aljofree and Harrison.",
      "Aljofree signed for Altrincham on a flexi-loan in the January transfer window and spent a few months around the non-league side's squad. The innovative loans allow youngsters to gain senior experience whilst remaining involved in the day-to-day environment at Carrington.",
      "Centre-back Aljofree didn't make an appearance for Altrincham, but the flexi-loan system has been effective elsewhere, helping Sam Mather to develop at Rochdale, for example.",
      "Harrison spent last season playing games for United's Under-21s and Under-18s, and he was named Reserve Player of the Year at the end of the campaign for his superb performances.",
      "The young goalkeeper was brilliant in between the sticks throughout 2023/24 and his shot-stopping display was crucial in the U18s' victory in the PL Cup against Manchester City.",
      "Harrison is a ball-playing 'keeper, whose distribution is a strength, and he did a Cruyff turn with Stockport's striker closing him down at Edgeley Park in the EFL Trophy last year.",
      "There are high hopes for Harrison in the academy and United believe they have a goalkeeper who has the potential to break into the first-team, which will eventually be his target.",
      "Harrison signed his first-ever professional contract with United in March 2023 and that came a year after joining the club from Stevenage Town on a scholarship deal.",

      "Manchester United's flight back from Brighton was delayed by two hours on Saturday. Their season is yet to take off.",
      "There are three glaring issues with United: their attackers don't score, there midfield is nigh-on non-existent and their defenders cannot see out games. Joao Pedro's header was the seventh added-time winner United have conceded under Erik ten Hag.",
      "They have also suffered draws that felt like a defeat against Crystal Palace, Sevilla, Brentford and Coventry City. Ten Hag bristled at the suggestion their game management was inept.",
      "\"I think we also often did the right things,\" he stated, \"that we often had success. For instance, when we win the trophies and there were many other big games we take the points. On this occasion today we should do better.",
      "\"On many occasions we have done very good in situations where we brought the score over the line and take the result.\"",
      "Ten Hag dined alone in Hale on Sunday. Even with a teeming brains trust in the dugout to support him he will have felt lonely in the technical area in the 95th minute at Brighton.",
      "His in-game management brought upon United's collapse. Replacing Bruno Fernandes for Scott McTominay when the United captain's influence was growing was illogical and so was the unenforced withdrawal of Harry Maguire for Matthijs de Ligt. It is an unwritten rule in management not to disrupt your back four in-game. Antony's sole impact was to concede a cynical foul.",
      "McTominay was the right substitute for the wrong man. Kobbie Mainoo has looked weary since his return and Casemiro is on his last legs. Somehow, both midfielders saw out a game where United's midfield was second-best.",
      "\"That (conceding in added time)'s very disappointing, yeah,\" Ten Hag admitted. \"Because in the Community Shield we concede just before time, we should be more clinical in such situations, read the game, take the point if you can't win any more. We were close to winning this game but definitely don't lose the game.\"",
      "Sending McTominay on suggested it was win-or-bust. McTominay is nicknamed 'McTerminator' and his function is akin to Arnold Schwarzenegger's robotic responses: score goal, kick ball, head ball or tackle.",
      "McTominay is one of the tallest and most physical athletes in the United squad yet he shrank when Simon Adingra's cross found the unmarked Pedro. With a completely different attacking quartet on for the end of the match, United were disorganised and led by temporary captain Casemiro, whose English is limited.",
      "Despite one win from three games, United are a more competent and composed team in possession with 'game model' the new buzz phrase. Their approach play was encouraging again and they have created nine good or great chances without converting any of them in their matches this month.",
      "They are second in the expected goals table. One does not require such pseudo-intellectual standings to know United have been creative in the final third and one hopes Ten Hag does not refer to it at Carrington on Thursday. Coming second in it will not secure Champions League qualification next year.",
      "United's profligacy boils down to the absence of a dependable and proven goalscorer. They have taken a risk in investing more than £108.5million in two strikers at an identical age and with identically modest goalscoring records in Italy. Joshua Zirkzee will think twice about sliding towards goal when the ball is out of reach in the future.",
      "It was barely a footnote, but Mason Mount had his best and most meaningful half for United in Hove. The extent of Mount's \"issue\" that forced him off at half-time is yet to be established but after his laudable work off the ball against Fulham he was also effective on it at Brighton. That work ethic and willingness to lead the charge was evident when he penned in Jan Paul van Hecke and immediately beckoned his teammates up the pitch.",
      "United do not currently have that urgency in the middle third. Mainoo is more conductor than destructor. He favours playing with Casemiro yet Ten Hag started phasing him out with his FA Cup final demotion.",
      "Only the United hierarchy are taking until the final week of the transfer window to bring in a replacement. Manuel Ugarte is, unlike Mount, an out-and-out central midfielder and would bring impetus to an area where one midfielder has his bags packed, another is going next year and another may follow him out. Christian Eriksen warmed up at Brighton but is still out in the cold.",
      "If there was an acceptable offer for him this week, he would be allowed to take off.",

      "The 39-year-old veteran, renowned for his spells at United and an extraordinary nine years at Real Madrid, took a step back from the European limelight with his move. Yet his presence was felt at Euro 2024 playing for Portugal, which looks likely to be his farewell to European competition participation.",
      "In a discussion with NOW, Ronaldo said: \"I don't know if I will retire soon, in two or three years... but probably I will retire here at Al-Nassr. I'm very happy at this club, I feel good in this country too. I'm happy to play in Saudi Arabia and I want to continue.\"",
      "The forward started every match for Portugal at Euro 2024 without finding the net but has had a fruitful start at Al-Nassr, netting three times in the opening trio of matches. Despite the lack of goals in the European tournament, Ronaldo is hopeful for another chance to represent his country in the upcoming Nations League fixtures slated for September, reports the Mirror.",
      "Ronaldo has hinted that his international career may be nearing its end, but for now, he remains focused on playing and has dismissed any notions of transitioning into coaching.",
      "\"When I leave the national team, I won't tell anyone in advance and it will be a very spontaneous decision on my part, but also a very well thought-out one,\" Ronaldo stated.",
      "\"Right now what I want is to be able to help the national team in their upcoming matches. We have the Nations League ahead of us and I would really like to play. At the moment, I'm not thinking about being a coach of the first team or any team.\"",
      "\"It doesn't even cross my mind, I've never thought about it. I don't see my future going through that. I see myself doing other things outside of football, but only God knows what the future holds.\"",
      "Portugal manager Roberto Martinez has set his sights on winning the 2026 World Cup, a tournament that Ronaldo may have retired from by then. However, the Spanish boss still sees the superstar as a crucial player for his team.",
      "\"When we talk about Cristiano, we are talking about a striker who scores goals. But our striker is much more than this. I was happy with his discipline. He opened up spaces, reacted to losing the ball, and I think the lack of goals from Cristiano was shared in general around the team,\" he told zerozero.",

Toney is also regarded as one of the best penalty takers in world football having netted 30 spot kicks, missing just two.",
      "It's why this is such a good opportunity for someone to sign a striker who is clearly available with just days left of the summer transfer window. Toney's Brentford contract will expire next summer and with no signs of an extension, the West London club will be keen to sell and earn a healthy profit.",
      "Interest from Chelsea and Saudi Arabia has emerged this summer and United have been previously linked. Having only ever won the EFL trophy in his career, staying in England is likely to hold greater appeal.",
      "And after winning two trophies in two seasons under Erik ten Hag and with ambitious plans for the future under Ineos, United could be the perfect destination. Whilst a move to Chelsea may have the appeal of staying in London, the chaotic project at Stamford Bridge should dissuade some new signings.",

      "When the argument is presented like that, it was a no-brainer to sell McTominay this summer, but the decision wasn't that simple following the best season of the player's career.",
      "\"Du, du, du, du, du, Scott McTominay,\" was sung by United fans in the Stretford End during the opening game of the season and he received rapturous applause when he was brought on. McTominay is a boyhood United fan, he progressed through the academy and fans who regularly chanted his name last term will feel it's bittersweet to see him pack his bags for Italy.",
      "McTominay was a flawed player but he was United through and through. He didn't pull up any trees in the academy, but he did brilliantly to break into the first team during Jose Mourinho's tenure and even better to establish himself in the dressing room after his senior bow.",
      "It's an outstanding achievement to make a debut for United but the bigger challenge is to stay in the team. That's the toughest challenge of them all and Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and McTominay are the most recent players to have done just that.",
      "McTominay stands out from that list because the other three players are considered to be more 'talented'. However, there are different ways to the top and McTominay's athleticism helped him along the way, allowing him to cope with the demands of the Premier League.",
      "The 27-year-old scored 10 goals in all competitions last season and became a matchwinner. He tended to produce when United desperately needed a goal, scoring a brace against Brentford in October's 2-1 win, twice against Chelsea in December in another 2-1 victory and netting the winner against Aston Villa in February.",
      "McTominay's late runs into the box suddenly became his trademark as he reinvented himself as a goalscorer and United will miss his ability to impact games when times are tough.",
      "They will also miss his leadership qualities and understanding of the club. Different sources who have been present at Carrington over the last few years have all praised McTominay's character and how he acts around the training ground, members of staff and young players.",
      "When results have been difficult and characters have been tested, McTominay has stood up to the scrutiny and taken responsibility in interviews when other players declined to do so.",
      "There have been some brilliant moments during McTominay's time at the club, like his performance against PSG in the Champions League in 2019, his goal against Manchester City in the last game at Old Trafford before the pandemic and, of course, his brace against Brentford last season.",
      "Everyone knows McTominay's limitations and that's ultimately why he's being sold, but his commitment on the pitch could never be questioned and his recent reinvention as an attacking midfielder perhaps should have happened sooner during his career at Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay doesn't have the skill set to play in a defensive midfield role for United and was pigeonholed as that player due to his double-pivot partnership with Fred.",
      "The McFred years won't be remembered fondly by supporters, but Fred left last summer with the best wishes of fans and McTominay will receive exactly the same.",

      "The CEO of Anderlecht has hinted Christian Eriksen's wage demands were too large to lure him away from Manchester United.",
      "Anderlecht's manager was part of Thomas Frank's coaching staff at Brentford and discussed the possibility of rekindling his relationship with Eriksen earlier in the transfer window.",
      "The Belgian club have been among the sides to be linked with a move for Eriksen, along with his former club Ajax and a handful Turkish clubs, but he remains a United player.",
      "Eriksen's role was reduced last season and he made just 12 Premier League starts, which led to suggestions he could leave United in search of regular game time. He has entered the final year of his contract and this summer was the last chance to bank a reasonable fee for him.",
      "Anderlecht had expressed an interest in signing Eriksen, but there are just two days remaining in the summer transfer window and he is expected to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "“I myself have never mentioned the name Christian Eriksen, but of course, I know Christian. He is a top player who is still contracted for one year at a top club,” Anderlecht's CEO, Jesper Fredberg, told Het Nieuwsblad. \"At the moment, (signing Eriksen) doesn’t seem realistic.",
      "\"But if a door suddenly opens, I want to be the first to step in. It’s not just about what Manchester United is asking for, but it will also be about the player’s salary demands in such a case.”",
      "Although Eriksen discussed his lack of game time in the Danish press when on international duty last season, he sounded more upbeat about his future at Old Trafford in July.",
      "\"It depends what is coming and what is going,\" Eriksen said. \"But like I said, I'm really happy, my family is settled in Manchester, I'm loving my time with United but like you said, as a player you want to play as much as possible but that's also about convincing the manager to let you play.",
      "\"So I'll turn that up, try to do my thing and I'll see where I'm at, but my feeling is I'm very happy at United. I still want to get on the pitch, obviously I'm staying the same person if I'm playing or not, trying to help if I can, but I want to be the football guy, not the social guy.\"",
      "While Eriksen is settled and happy away from the pitch in Manchester with his wife and children, he has been an unused substitute in both Premier League games this season.",

      "Manuel Ugarte is braced to brush off any criticism heading his way at Manchester United - just like Darwin Nunez has had to do at Liverpool.",
      "The Red Devils' newest recruit will join from Paris Saint-Germain in a deal worth up to £50.7million, and he'll have fellow Copa America runner-up Nunez for company in the Premier League. A familiar face could help Ugarte bed in among his new surroundings, though the midfield general has shown all the signs of possessing a one-man army mentality.",
      "Ugarte, 23, is an independent spirit when it comes to tackling online criticism, something Liverpool's record signing has had to endure plenty of in his career. And United's impending arrival demonstrated not only his own mental fortitude but a desire to protect those close to him when addressing the topic of social media and its impact on players.",
      "\"For example, Darwin [Nunez] had moments where he was killed badly, and that is also something that has a lot of merit when you see where he is today,\" Ugarte told Uruguayan broadcaster Channel 10 earlier this summer. \"You have to be in the right head to get to where he got to with all the damage he got.",
      "\"When I see a teammate get hit, I sometimes feel like the next day it could be me, because people kill you the way they put you up there. The best thing is to surround yourself with people you love and trust, and not give the ball to the net, because that’s how the net is nowadays.\"",
      "Ugarte - who reportedly underwent his United medical on Wednesday - acknowledged in the same interview that footballers are \"very exposed\" on the internet given their celebrity profiles. He's also taken a step away from social media, though he's accepting of the fact \"not everyone's going to like you.\"",
      "Despite becoming a big name in Portuguese football and growing his status by joining PSG, the midfield general is bound to experience another step up in attention at United. And while Ugarte has a resilient attitude to scrutiny as a whole, he suggested even he isn't invincible.",
      "\"I say this with humility, there are people who don't know anything about football and have an opinion, and maybe that comment has a lot of likes and it seems to be true,\" he continued. \"I think it's something I handle quite well; but if something happens to me where everyone kills me, it's not good.\"",
      "Thick skin will be a prerequisite if he's to thrive in his new English setting, particularly after United have splashed the cash once more this summer in their bid to return to the top. Ugarte joins new recruits Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui in an effort to restore United's former glories, and the critics won't remain silent if they feel he's falling short.",

      "The club's academy has a large following around the world and MUTV have regularly shown U18s and Under-21s fixtures over the years, so fans can keep up to date with the development of United's youngsters, but in-house coverage has been indirectly impacted by job losses.",
      "There have been four matches between U18 and U21 level this season and MUTV didn't broadcast those games, which left fans wondering why the coverage had disappeared.",

      "The Reds found themselves 1-0 down at the interval after Danny Welbeck tapped home from close range to give the hosts the lead. At half-time, it was clear something needed to change with Joshua Zirkzee being introduced to allow Fernandes to drop deeper into his preferred No.10 role.",
      "United's change had the desired effect on the hour mark as Amad's deflected strike brought the visitors level. Alejandro Garnacho thought he had made it 2-1 shortly afterwards but his goal was ruled out for offside after an agonising touch by the offside Zirkzee on the line.",
      "Instead of pushing for the winner in the final ten minutes, Ten Hag chose to try and consolidate the point as Scott McTominay was introduced for Fernandes. The Portuguese midfielder looked unimpressed by the decision as he left the field and ultimately it would backfire.",
      "Brighton won the game with the last chance of the game as Joao Pedro headed home unmarked at the back stick to win it for the Seagulls. Following the match, Wright told his podcast Wrighty’s House that he saw Fernandes do something that would likely unimpress his manager.",

      "It was schoolboy defending from United and they were punished. The challenge of facing Liverpool, who have both of their games in the league so far, comes next and Erik ten Hag may be forced to abandon the false nine system that he persisted with at the Amex Stadium.",

      "Zirkzee could start against Liverpool and seems likely, but he's a different player to Hojlund. The Dutchman likes to drop deep and help build up play - he has described where he likes to play as the '9.5 role' - while Hojlund likes to stretch defences with his pace and power.",

      "It's sometimes a case of you don't know what you have until it's gone. There's no denying Hojlund has improvements to make and he must sharpen his finishing, but his qualities make United a better team and he would have made tests against Fulham and Brighton easier to overcome.",
      "Thankfully, United have to play just one more game (Liverpool) without Hojlund and fans will be hoping he hits the ground running after the September international break.",

      "Comparing McTominay to another United stalwart, Darren Fletcher, Ferguson added: \"I signed him when he was seven or eight years of age and he was actually a centre-forward as a kid. He's just sprouted, a little bit like Darren Fletcher. Darren had a few little annoying injuries as he was growing and needed some rest periods and things like that.",
      "\"McTominay is of a similar type to Darren - long, lanky, good winner of the ball and a good turn of pace going forward, a great attitude to the game. All these attitudes that Darren Fletcher had, he's got them.",
      "\"Even if you go back to my time with Darren, I very seldom left him out of big games, particularly against Arsenal. He was fantastic against Arsenal and Vieira and I had no problems. McTominay is going forward on those guidelines that Darren pursued for a long time at United. It's really rewarding for me to see a Scot coming through.\"",

      "Janssen joined United on a three-year deal with the option of an additional 12 months earlier in the summer following the expiration of her contract with Wolfsburg. The Netherlands defender returns to the Women’s Super League (WSL) having previously spent four seasons at Arsenal, with whom she won the league title, the FA Cup and two League Cups.",
      "Reflecting on her decision to join the Reds in her first interview with the club, Janssen said: \"I knew a little bit (about United) and their fan base is like crazy, it's really nice to get to know them and to see how the club has developed and also to see where we can go with the team.",
      "\"The club have big ambitions. The growth they have been making the past six years since they have started has also been really good. Of course there will also be some bumps in the road which I heard from the girls as well that last season was maybe was not the easiest season.",
      "\"But it's about knowing the up and downs are just part of the journey and it's so exciting to see where we can go in the next few years. That's what also drew me to the club, the potential we have in the next few years. I want to help the club and I want to do it together with the girls.\"",
      "Last season was a disappointing one for United as they finished fifth in the WSL, winning just 10 of their 22 league games. However, the Reds did manage to secure the club's first major women's trophy by beating Tottenham Hotspur to the FA Cup and Janssen believes this will spur Skinner's side on to achieving more success next term.",
      "\"That's the goal,\" she said. \"I'm hungry for more trophies and I think also they got last year the first trophy, so I think they're hungry for more trophies as well.\"",
      "The defender added: \"I think it has changed a lot. I have looked a little bit at the games and seeing how things are going and you see that the league is very competitive. You need to be at the top of your game every single weekend. You cannot play at 80 per cent because even the teams that are lower in the table can still beat you.\"",

      "The 21-year-old joined the Reds from Everton in 2022 though she is yet to make a competitive appearance for the club, having since enjoyed loan spells at both Bristol City and Tottenham Hotspur. Clinton excelled for the latter last term, scoring four goals and assisting four others in 20 Women's Super League (WSL) appearances and playing an integral role in Spurs’ charge to their first ever Women’s FA Cup final, though she was ineligible to play against her parent club and eventual victors United at Wembley.",
      "Her impressive form saw her receive her first senior England call up earlier this year. She made her first full start against Austria after two appearances off the bench, and duly made an impact with her first international goal in a 7-2 win for the Lionesses.",
      "Clinton impressed so much at Tottenham that the club were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" manager Robert Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "However United boss Skinner has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester. \"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" he said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "And Clinton has now voiced her commitment to the Reds, insisting her ambition is to add more silverware to the club's collection. \"To go to Tottenham and get confidence was just amazing,\" she said at the start-studded awards ceremony on Tuesday night. \"And to improve obviously personally. The aim is always to win trophies with Manchester United.\"",
      "On her award, Clinton added: “It’s such an honour to be voted by the unbelievable players that play in this league. It’s the best league in the world. “To go out on loan, learning as a young player and being recognized is lovely. I’ve played with confidence and when you play with that then you see the best version of a player. Tottenham have been a massive part of my journey, and I can’t thank them enough. Goals and visualisation are important to me but most of all just enjoying playing. If I’m enjoying myself then I play my best football.”",
      "Clinton also featured in the PFA Women's Team of the Year, alongside Manchester City stars Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw, Yui Hasegawa, Lauren Hemp, Khiara Keating, Alex Greenwood, Laia Aleixandri. She beat out a host of talented players to earn the award with Lauren James, Aggie Beever-Jones, Khiara Keating, Maya Le Tissier and Jess Park among the names on the Top Six shortlist.",

The date was August 19, 2018 and the Scotland international ensured the Reds' long-awaited renaissance began in style by netting a last-gasp winner against bitter rivals Liverpool in the League Cup.",
      "The setting - in front of just 829 fans at an overcast Prenton Park - belied the enormity of the occassion. This was United's first competitive game in 13 years, their first competitive outing since the Glazer regime opted to disband their senior women's team after deeming it not to be part of the club's \"core business\".",
      "The team was peppered with familar faces. Alex Greenwood, now captain of Manchester City, teed up Arnot to score the winner. Lauren James, who returned to childhood club Chelsea for what was - in 2021 - a British record fee, started in midfield, while current United stars Ella Toone, Millie Turner and Leah Galton also featured.",
      "\"For a team that has only been together for six weeks they weathered the storm quite well,\" manager Casey Stoney told BBC Radio 5 Live after the game.",
      "\"I recruited from the second tier, they've stepped up and shown they are more than capable of playing a level above that. There's no pressure from the club to get promotion but these players want to be playing in the top flight. They're history makers now.\"",
      "In spite of Stoney's measured assessment of United's ambitions, the Reds did achieve promotion at the first time of asking, subsequently finishing fourth in their first season in the Women's Super League (WSL). And now, just six years on from that League Cup victory over Liverpool, United are a card-carrying member of the top flight's elite.",
      "Stoney's departure in the summer of 2021 was a blow but her replacement, former Birmingham City boss Marc Skinner, has presided over the most successful period in the club's history. In 2022/23, the Reds took the title race to the final day, posting a club-record points tally in the process while also reaching the FA Cup final.",
      "Last term, despite a disappointing fifth-place finish in the WSL, United beat Tottenham Hotspur to the FA Cup trophy; a reality which would have seemed inconceivable on that momentous afternoon at Prenton Park more than half a decade ago.",
      "While the Reds have come a tremendously long way since then, it is fair to say this summer has not been without its challenges. First came the revelataion that Skinner had been handed a one-year contract extension - a decision which was not universally popular with the United fanbase.",
      "Then came the exodus of some of the club's biggest stars. England goalkeeper Mary Earps left to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), citing United's transitional state and her own ambition to compete for more silverware as her chief motivating factors. Club captain Katie Zelem also departed on a free transfer, as did fan-favourite striker Lucia Garcia.",
      "All of this unfolded has against the backdrop of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's barely concealed apathy towards Skinner's side. The INEOS chief gave a tone-deaf interview to Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "This was swiftly followed by United Women being ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp, though it is understood Skinner and his players will still have access to all the necessary facilities.",
      "Still, the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United have been concerning.",
      "That said, the Reds have recruited shrewdly in the transfer market, with the acquisition of Brighton & Hove Albion striker Elisabeth Terland and Swedish defender Anna Sandberg, in particular, inspiring excitement, while the appointment of Dan Ashworth as sporting director inspires hope of tangible change at the club.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said in an open letter to supporters last month.",
      "\"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "Indeed, six years on from that win over Liverpool, United now have all the ingredients in place to be truly successful. The Reds may already have made history in the years since their reformation but, with the WSL set to be more competitive than ever next term, it is clear the hard work is only just beginning.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Canada international Simi Awujo on a three-year deal.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder joins the Reds from the United States collegiate system, where she represented the University of Southern California’s USC Trojans. Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber. The Reds finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last term and won the Women's FA Cup. They will get their new campaign underway against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday, September 22.",
