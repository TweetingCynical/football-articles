      "Former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has taken aim at Sir Jim Ratcliffe, claiming he \"doesn't have much experience in football\" and insisting \"a lot needs to change\" at Old Trafford.",
      "Mourinho has experience of managing United during a difficult period after he was sacked in 2018 after picking up just 26 points from 17 games in the 2018-19 season.",
      "The 'Special One' did win two major trophies at United and also finished second in 2017-18 and suggests Ratcliffe's lack of footballing experience might hinder the club - in a subtle jab at the billionaire and the United hierarchy.",
      "Speaking to Portuguese outlet Record, he said: \"Today, I think that with the change in ownership at the club, with an owner who doesn't have much experience in football but rather in sport...",
      "\"What happened to Ruben, from being the manager of the worst Manchester United in Premier League history to having continuity and confidence to continue and be Ruben Amorim, is a sign that a lot needs to change.\"",
      "However, Mourinho believes current boss Amorim has \"incredible potential\" to be a success at Old Trafford and urged the club to keep backing him - and to allow him to do his work as he sees fit.",
      "\"With that stability... We all agree that he's a manager with great potential and personality. I think he has incredible potential to do great work.\"",
      "Mourinho is now at Turkish club Fenerbahce, where he is hoping to win his first major since joining them last summer as he approaches his second season.",
      "Since leaving United, Mourinho had an unsuccessful spell at Tottenham, where he was sacked just days before the 2021 Carabao Cup final against Manchester City. He later won the UEFA Conference League with Roma before also being sacked by the Italian side last year.",
      "Amorim will be hoping for a much better second season with United as he prepares for a pre-season tour of the United States - where they will play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United have already made two high profile signings as they look to bounce back from their dreadful first campaign under Amorim after snapping up forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United’s desperation to get Marcus Rashford off their wage bill has seen them dramatically drop their valuation of the striker. Rashford is poised to join Barcelona on a season-long loan with an option to buy after being frozen out by Ruben Amorim at United.",
      "Amorim’s relationship with Rashford broke down in December when he was ejected from the United first-team squad. He was then sent out on loan to Aston Villa in January, and having resurrected his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances, Rashford set his sights on Barca.",
      "The 27-year-old rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and has been waiting patiently for Barca and United to come to terms over a move. That has now happened and Rashford flew into the city earlier this week to complete the final stages of his move.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to take Rashford on loan for the 2025/26 season with an option to make it permanent. Barca will pay the entirety of his wages after Rashford agreed to take a 15 per cent pay cut from his £325,000-a-week wages. They can also sign him for €30million (£26m).",
      "Earlier this summer, United made it clear that they would happily sell Rashford to whichever club would stump up £40m. His contract with the club runs until June 2028, so their asking price wasn’t outrageous, especially considering they believed he was worth £100m in April 2024 when Paris Saint-Germain were sniffing around.",
      "United’s rapidly sliding scale around Rashford just demonstrates the sourness around the forward since Amorim made up his mind. The England striker has been part of Amorim’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ over the past few weeks, forced to train separately from the first team at Carrington.",
      "Rashford and fellow unwanted players Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have been arriving at the training ground post-5pm, when everyone else has already left. It is a brutal policy that doesn’t have universal support inside the building but is designed to speed up their exits.",
      "It may have played a part in securing Rashford’s exit, while Sancho is also poised to leave for Juventus. But what is more likely to have done the trick is United’s desperation to offload their high-earning players who Amorim had made clear have no future at the club.",
      "Rashford was not Barcelona’s first choice this summer. The Catalan giants had tried to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club, but the move fell through. They also showed an interest in Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, but were put off by the Reds’ transfer stance.",
      "“I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players,” manager Hansi Flick said earlier in the summer. “I like them and we’ll see what happens.”",
      "Rashford will not be a guaranteed starter, either. He can play on the left of Barca’s 4-3-3 formation, but will be aware that Raphinha has just enjoyed an incredible campaign in that position, while he will be a mere back-up to Robert Lewandowski at centre-forward.",

      "Manchester United’s new signing Bryan Mbeumo already has his sights set on emulating his boyhood hero Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Mbeumo, who has joined United from Brentford in a deal worth up to £71million, revealed the first football shirt he owned growing up was Ronaldo’s iconic No.7. The Cameroon star, who plays out wide like Ronaldo but can also operate centrally, was just four when his idol joined United for the first of two spells in 2003.",
      "In that six-year spell, Ronaldo scored 118 goals in 292 appearances, before returning for an ill-fated second stint at United, which ended in acrimony after a season-and-a-half. Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last season, modelled himself on Ronaldo and said he dreams of matching the exploits of his hero now he is a United player himself.",
      "“My first top was one with Ronaldo behind [on the back],” said Mbeumo, when asked to name his favourite player. “It changed the time. When I was really young, the two best footballers were Ronaldo and Messi. When I was growing up, Neymar. After that, it was Eden Hazard.",
      "“My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. But when you’re actually doing it, it’s completely different.”",
      "On the pitch, Mbeumo is an uncompromising, fearless and physical attacker, who shows no mercy to opponents in his relentless quest for goals and assists. Off it, however, he is a completely different character, with the piano and chess his chief hobbies away from the pressure of playing football at the highest level.",
      "Asked if he was quiet or loud, Mbeumo said: “A little mix of the two. I’m quite quiet when I don’t know people. But when I know everyone I make jokes and have banter. I like piano and chess. I’m just a normal guy. I discovered the piano a few years ago, when a friend was playing and I wanted to try.",
      "“With chess, I played a little bit when I was younger. Two or three years ago, I started playing and I enjoyed it, so I play online. I have a board at home but I have no-one to play with.”",
      "Part of the initiation ritual for new signings at United is to perform a song in front of the squad, with Mbeumo hinting he could go one stage further. “Maybe I can play the piano and sing!” he said. “I know I’m a calmed and chilled guy out of the pitch, but on it I change completely. I’m really determined and focused.",
      "“It comes from my parents. They gave me my values. Also, all the coaches I’ve worked with gave me a lot of advice. It’s like a family and all the things you face in your personal life helps build your mentality and character.",
      "“I grew up in a small town, where everyone knew each other and I have a lot of memories from the stadium of my first team. I try to go back there at least once a year to see my old manager and the little kids, who have a dream as well, like I had. It’s really good for them to see someone who is here now. They can see that they can do it and that’s important for me.”",
      "Piano-loving Mbeumo will hope to hit the right notes for United and help spark their revival after they ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish of the Premier League era."

      "Hardly any players managed to avoid the Scotsman's infamous hairdryer treatment, with David Beckham memorably receiving an accidental boot to the face during one of Ferguson's eruptions following a defeat to Arsenal in the FA Cup in 2003",
      "However, one member of United's academy system came to rue crossing him more than most. Former Red Devils goalkeeper Mark Bosnich has revealed how the unnamed youngster was shipped out on loan after Ferguson caught him performing an impression of him in front of senior squad members.",
      "The episode, which Bosnich recounted during a chat with ex-United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster, occurred during the Australian's initial spell at the club between 1989 and 1991.",
      "Speaking on the Fozcast podcast, Bosnich said: \"I remember with one of the [younger] boys, the first team used to get him to imitate Fergie, because they used to say he was like Taggart.",
      "\"He came in behind him [as he was doing the impression] and he was out on loan two days later. You've got to be careful because you can't undermine the manager.\"",
      "Whilst Bosnich escaped Ferguson's wrath on that particular occasion, he recalled another incident when he wasn't so fortunate. The goalkeeper revealed how the boss lost his temper after catching him sporting long trousers during a practice match against Liverpool.",
      "\"We were 1-0 down at half-time and it was the most howling wind I've ever experienced at the Cliff, which was the old training ground,\" he said. \"It was either my first or second winter in England, and I put long pants on because I was freezing.",
      "\"He came in at half-time and he ripped me to shreds. He said, 'If you don't improve in the second half and get those long pants off, you're going up to Aberdeen and then you're going to experience what real cold is.' Eric [Harrison] told me that he wanted to see how I reacted. I took the pants off and we won 5-1 so that was alright.\"",
      "Bosnich originally departed United in 1991 owing to visa complications, but Ferguson brought him back eight years later. He was then regarded as the natural replacement for Peter Schmeichel following an impressive seven-year stint at Aston Villa.",
      "But the move didn't turn out as planned and Ferguson subsequently criticised Bosnich's mentality. The keeper transferred to Chelsea after his United exit, but received a nine-month football ban and was dismissed by his club following a failed drugs test in 2002. Despite a short-lived return in the A-League in 2008, he never featured in professional football again.",
      "In his second autobiography, Ferguson wrote: \"Mark Bosnich was, in my opinion, a terrible professional, which we should have known. The Bosnich buy stemmed from Peter Schmeichel announcing in the autumn of his final season that he would be retiring, which caught us on the hop. We jumped into decisions.",
      "\"We met Bosnich in January, despite reports filtering through to us about his conduct off the pitch. I sent someone down to watch him in training. He was doing nothing in the sessions that convinced me he was the right man for Manchester United.",
      "\"I changed tack and went for Edwin van der Sar instead, spoke to his agent and then to Martin Edwards, who told me, 'Alex, I'm sorry, I've shaken hands with Bosnich.' That was a blow. Martin had shaken Mark's hand and would not go back on his word, which I respect. But it was a bad piece of business.\"",
      "Bosnich later hit back at Ferguson's account of his time at United, branding it a \"lie\" and accusing the legendary manager of holding a grudge.",
      "Speaking to FourFourTwo in 2019, Bosnich said: \"It wasn't unfair – it was just a lie. He's always said that he doesn't bear any grudges, but obviously he does. But he can say that because he knows what happened afterwards, with the drugs and so on – he's got good evidence to back himself up.",
      "\"At that time, though, it was a lie. Alex Ferguson signed me twice. I wouldn't be talking to you now about my career unless he had taken a chance on me originally. Yes, we had a falling out, but these things happen. He was a great manager to play under.\"",

      "Mbeumo, 25, is relishing making his Old Trafford debut for United in front of 75,000 fans – having experienced the frenzied atmosphere there as an opposition player with Brentford.",
      "“The fans are crazy, the stadium is amazing - everyone wants to play here,” said Mbeumo. “There's a lot of excitement and I'm ready for it. The manager seems really close to his players, with his mentality.",
      "“It seems to be a really good group, the spirit is really important and I've only heard good things about the gaffer and the team. It's really important for me to create links as soon as possible with my team-mates, in and out of the pitch.",
      "“Spirit is important and I want to be involved as soon as possible. My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. When you're actually doing it, it's completely different and I'm just happy to be here.\"",
      "Asked why he had always wanted to play for United, Mbeumo said: “My first top was a United one, with Ronaldo behind [on the back]. It's such a big club, one of the best clubs I could join.",
      "“Representing my country at the biggest club is something I always wanted to do. I always wanted to play at the highest level. Now I just want to show what I can do.”",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed just seven Premier League goals between them last season and Amorim wants a striker capable of scoring 20-plus goals in a campaign. He also admitted that midfield was an area of concern after a 0-0 draw with Leeds United in pre-season.",
      "“The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big,” Amorim said. “We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball. But we created chances.”",

      "Manchester United's audacious bid for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, surprisingly, did not come off, but they aren't the only club to chance their arm with a temporary move like that.",
      "The Red Devils are weighing up what to do at No 1 with Andre Onana injured and facing a race against time to be fit for the Premier League's opening weekend. Martinez has been linked with a move away from Villa Park, but on a permanent basis.",
      "United attempted to see whether they could get the Argentine on a short-term basis. For Villa though there was nothing to gain and the offer was hit with a quick no.",
      "It wouldn't have been the weirdest loan move to ever take place however. Throughout the history of England's top flight clubs have looked to plug gaps, be it for a couple of months or for a season, and that has led to players making the most surprising of moves.",
      "Martinez, a World Cup winner and first choice goalkeeper where he is, would've had to swap the team who finished sixth for one who ended in 15th. It would've been a switched that wouldn't have suited his parent club, who valued him at around £40m.",
      "The most eye-raising loan moves have often stemmed from a club needing to get a player, no matter how big his reputation, back into form. We take a look at some of the short-term switches that have happened over the years - some proving rather unsuccessful.",
      "A career path that goes Real Madrid, PSG, Stoke City is always going to make people ask questions. The Spaniard had fallen down the pecking order at both clubs but things started with a bang as he scored the winner on his debut against Arsenal. That was about as good as it got though and he walked out of the stadium when then manager Mark Hughes left him on the bench on one occasion. He experienced personal issues himself and couldn't stop the Trotters being relegated.",
      "So the centre-half was on the books of QPR and couldn't prevent them going down, but his stock was high enough that Southampton offered the defender the chance to stay in the Premier League. His loan was cancelled mid-season and his Championship club sanctioned a loan to the Reds, where Jurgen Klopp was in charge. He only played four times, but two of those had him as a makeshift striker.",
      "In March 2021 Sir Alex Ferguson had a bit of an injury crisis with Fabien Barthez and Raimond van der Gouw struggling for fitness. His next move? Give Motherwell a call and go after Goram, then into his mid-30s. United received UEFA's permission to sign a goalkeeper on loan and came up with £100,000 to get Goram from north of the border.",
      "The player actually thought it was Ally McCoist playing a prank on him such was his shock and initially hung up. He would play just twice for the Red Devils and was subbed off in both games having failed to keep a clean sheet in either outing.",
      "When the north London side needed a striker in January they took the unusual step of turning to the old Division One, now the Championship, for a striker who hadn't scored a league goal since August. Nevertheless, they went after the Owls star. Booth moved to Spurs for a month as cover for the injured trio of Les Ferdinand, Steffen Iversen and Chris Armstrong. Director of football David Pleat claimed he had the opportunity to make a real point, but he failed to make it. Rules at the time didn’t allow loan deals between top-flight sides, but Booth returned to Sheffield without scoring.",
      "The teenage sensation won Euro 2016 with Portugal, was named the Young Player of the Tournament and won the Golden Boy award which sealed a move to Bayern Munich. He was tipped to take European football but storm but struggled and eventually found himself in Wales. The Swans thought it was a coup when they landed him, but he was anything but and Sanches flopped, playing just 12 times in the league.",
      "One of those deals that, on the face of it, looked a good bit of business. A World Cup winner with Brazil and a Champions League winner at AC Milan. His move to Elland Road would be a disaster and the centre-half was sent-off on his Leeds debut against Birmingham. He would play six more times and across those Leeds conceded 25 times in those seven games, losing six. His loan move ended within months of him moving to Yorkshire.",
      "The veteran striker defied all his doubters when it first came into the Premier League with Norwich, scoring 15 times. He went from League Two to the top flight in three years, but later left the Canaries to join Wigan. He was by no means prolific, but Villa still chose to come calling as they looked for goals in their attack. Sitting in mid-table, they landed Holt, who would only score once in ten games.",
      "If you struggle to remember a loan move, that's never a great gauge of how its gone. David Pizarro had been a regular for years at a competitive Roma side and the midfielder signed for City on loan in January 2012, back when Roberto Mancini was in charge. He would only make seven appearances in all competitions, scoring just the once."

      "Viktor Gyokeres' agent once revealed just how highly he thought of Ruben Amorim, admitting that he turned down lucrative offers from the Premier League so his player could remain with the manager at Sporting CP. Gyokeres signed for the Portuguese giants back in 2023.",
      "Current Manchester United head coach Amorim was still in charge at the time. Under his guidance, the Swedish striker blossomed into a prolific goalscorer, netting 66 times in 68 appearances for Amorim.",
      "Their good relationship, coupled with United's struggles up front, has led to persistent rumours linking Gyokeres with a move to Old Trafford since Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "A transfer also seems unlikely from Gyokeres' end, due to his agent Hasan Cetinkaya reportedly being upset by Amorim's handling of Victor Lindelof's exit – another one of his clients.",
      "Portuguese news outlet Record reports that the Turk was disappointed that United did not offer the 31-year-old central defender a new contract this summer after eight years of service, resulting in him leaving as a free agent.",
      "Lindelof featured 18 times for Amorim and is understood to have wanted to remain at the club. Cetinkaya was left even more frustrated given how hard he pushed for Gyokeres to join Amorim’s Sporting project two years ago and stay at the club last summer.",
      "That even involved him turning down offers from Premier League clubs who promised bigger wages, resulting in collapsed deals.",
      "In an interview with Record last summer, prior to Amorim joining United, Cetinkaya praised the manager by saying: “I’m not surprised that Ruben is being linked to Liverpool. It’s normal, his work is of a high level and is what clubs are looking for.",
      "“It will be more difficult for Viktor to stay if Ruben Amorim leaves Sporting, because Viktor came precisely because of Ruben. The day we met, I said to Ruben, ‘Here is my boy, he came to Sporting because of you.’",
      "“Obviously, I will have to talk to the president, the president is the boss, the one who makes the decisions, and we will have to know what he thinks for the future and what Sporting’s project is, but Viktor also has a say, obviously, and if Ruben Amorim leaves, it will be more difficult to continue.”",
      "“I have several top clubs interested in Viktor,” he added. “I can’t, of course, mention names of clubs, but they are top clubs, some from the Premier League, but not only England.",
      "“It is important to emphasise this point: I chose Sporting for Viktor when there were eight other clubs interested. They were paying more and I could have taken him to the Premier League. I chose Sporting because of Ruben Amorim, because he could help Viktor develop, and it changed his career.”",
      "Although he is set to miss out on Gyokeres, Amorim will be delighted to have a new-look forward line at his disposal heading into the new season. United this week completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £71million, having already brought in Matheus Cunha for £62.5m earlier this summer.",
      "Meanwhile, Premier League rivals Arsenal have long been closing in on a deal for Gyokeres, which could end up being worth an initial £54.86m (€63.5m) plus around £8.64m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "It has been widely suggested that the striker only wants to join the Gunners this summer, going as far as to go on strike in order to force through a move to north London. But no full agreement on the proposed transfer has been signed off yet by Sporting.",

      "Manchester United have jetted off to the United States for their pre-season tour with their squad overhaul only part-complete. United came into the summer transfer window with big plans to rip up their squad and start again after a dreadful campaign, but it’s been slow going so far.",
      "Defeat in the Europa League final after finishing 15th in the Premier League sparked serious questions in the camp. The idea was that Ruben Amorim would be backed in the transfer market, with the unwanted players discarded and the reset button pressed.",
      "The early arrival of Matheus Cunha, in a £62.5million transfer from Wolves, appeared to be a statement of intent. But it has taken six more weeks for the second arrival to be sealed, with Bryan Mbeumo joining for £71m from Brentford on Monday.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are major signings for United, who have managed to capture two of the most exciting players in the Premier League, despite not being able to offer them any European football in the upcoming campaign. But there remains lots of work to do before the transfer window shuts on September 1.",
      "Firstly, the club needs to find buyers for the five members of their ‘bomb squad’ – Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. Rashford is heading to Barcelona on loan and Sancho is joining Juventus, but the other three are works in progress.",
      "In the meantime the search goes on for other targets. One avenue that has attracted more column inches in recent weeks is in goal, with interest in Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez clear. United reportedly made an offer to sign the World Cup winner on loan, only to see it rejected by Villa.",
      "Andre Onana’s mistakes have been well documented and back-up Altay Bayindir was no better when he stepped into the void last season. Emi Martinez would undoubtedly be a step up, if United can get a deal over the line; the issue is that he is under contract with Villa until June 2029 and they are unlikely to sanction a sale to a direct rival.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is another player United are considering, with Onana currently on the comeback from a hamstring injury. Lammens is valued at £17m by the Belgian club, making him a more realistic alternative.",
      "The Athletic says that another area Amorim wants improvement in is deep-lying midfield, where Casemiro is over the hill, Manuel Ugarte hasn’t impressed consistently and Kobbie Mainoo – like Scott McTominay before him – is better suited to playing further forward.",
      "United have been credited with an interest in Atalanta star Ederson – and the Brazilian would appear to be a perfect fit. Juventus and Inter Milan have also been linked with Ederson, who Atalanta value at €60m (£52m), but United have the potential advantage of having good relations with the Italian side, having previously signed Rasmus Hojlund and Amad from them.",
      "Ederson’s presence at the base of midfield would allow Amorim to field captain Bruno Fernandes in one of his two central midfield roles, with new signings Mbeumo and Cunha operating in the No.10 positions. Sporting Lisbon’s Morten Hjulmand, who Amorim knows well, is another option.",
      "Up front, United are searching for a centre-forward. They made enquiries over Hugo Ekitike, who is now joining Liverpool, and Viktor Gyokeres, who is Arsenal-bound, while Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins are on their long list.",
      "United would likely need to sell Hojlund this summer to help open up space and fund a move for a striker, and there have been rumours of interest from Serie A in the Danish striker, who managed just 10 goals in 52 games last season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko first came to United’s attention as a 16-year-old in Slovenia and the club held talks last summer. Earlier this summer it looked as though Arsenal preferred him to Gyokeres, but they ultimately changed their minds.",

      "According to Teamtalk, United have earmarked Hjulmand as a potential solution to strengthen their midfield, with Amorim keen on a reunion with the Denmark international. The 26-year-old joined Sporting after current United midfielder Manuel Ugarte joined Paris Saint-Germain in 2023.",
      "He featured in 47 matches across all competitions as Sporting clinched both the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal last term.",

      "He added: \"Many players wanted to stay at Sporting with Ruben Amorim because he is a great coach.\"",

      "Manchester United have restocked their attack to the tune of £133.5million with confirmation of Bryan Mbeumo's £71m arrival from Brentford on Monday night. He joins Matheus Cunha, the £62.5m signing from Wolves and the club's new No.10.",
      "Next on United's list is a new No.9. Neither Rasmus Hojlund nor Joshua Zirkzee have proven effective enough and last season, United's attack sorely lacked inspiration in the Premier League.",
      "One player regularly linked has been Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting Lisbon striker enjoyed a fruitful relationship with Ruben Amorim in Portugal, scoring 66 times in 68 appearances under the now-United boss.",
      "But Gyokeres won't be United's new centre-forward. Despite plenty of speculation in recent months, the Swede will not be heading to Old Trafford. Instead, he's increasingly set for Arsenal.",
      "Now, according to Portuguese publication Record, the striker's agent Hasan Cetinkaya has been left \"hurt\" by the current situation with regards United, Amorim and his client.",
      "The Turkish businessman's name may be familiar as he is also the representative of another Sweden international, Victor Lindelof. The 31 year-old was not offered a new United contract this summer after eight years of service, and has therefore left as a free agent.",
      "Lindelof made 18 appearances for Amorim after his arrival last November and it had been claimed that he wished to stay in Manchester this summer. Instead, the Portuguese head coach decided it was time to part ways.",
      "According to reports in Portugal, Amorim's decision has left Cetinkaya upset and therefore 'the door has been closed' from Gyokeres' representatives to joining United.",
      "Which shouldn't really be an issue given United aren't intent on fighting Arsenal for his signature and Gyokeres is heading into a title fight and the Champions League with the Gunners, if they can finally get his Sporting deal over the line."

      "Ashley Young has emerged as a target for Ipswich as the winger, who recently left Everton, continues to eye up a new club at the age of 40.",
      "The ex-Manchester United star was heavily linked with a move to Watford, the club where he began his career. The Hornets were even willing to hand him the captain's armband but the switch eventually stalled due to wages.",
      "Now Ipswich, who have the benefit of Premier League parachute payments, are ready to swoop in and add him to their squad. Young has not played in the second tier of English football for nearly two decades but is set to take the decision to drop down a league to keep his career going, reports TalkSport.",
      "The Tractor Boys have just been relegated and those who impressed, the likes of Liam Delap, have moved on. Omari Hutchinson could follow him and Kieran McKenna is trying to create a team capable of bouncing straight back up.",
      "Young was part of the Watford team that gained promotion from the Championship via the play-offs back in 2006. Ipswich and Watford go head-to-head on November 4 at Portman Road, which could see the winger go up against his boyhood club. The return game at Vicarage Road is in late February.",
      "Young continued to contribute for the Toffees last term but with David Moyes now at the helm the decision has been made to part ways. The veteran wide man became the oldest player in Premier League history to score from a free-kick when he notched for Everton against Wolves back in December.",
      "His first major move came in 2007 when he left Watford and headed to Aston Villa. He impressed at Villa Park over a number of years and was signed by Sir Alex Ferguson, spending nine years with the Manchester side, where he won the title. He later went to Inter Milan and had a second stint with Villa.",
      "The veteran has no plans to call it a day and recently said: “It's been one of those things where I've played so much this season. I feel so fit. I've not felt as fit as I have done for years. I just want to continue playing, however that may look, however that may seem, I'm not ready to retire.",
      "“I'm definitely going to carry on next season. Whichever way that is. I'm not getting any younger. I'm going to be 40 in July. I feel as fit as when I was in my 20s. I'm definitely going to continue. The stats are there - I've played 31 times this season and I feel I can keep going.”"

      "Simons scored 11 times last term and came up with a stunning strike for the Netherlands in their Euro 2024 semi-final loss to England last summer. He isn't the only player Chelsea have made their interest known for, reports the Telegraph.",
      "Enzo Maresca has expressed a desire to potentially sign Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United. The Argentine's future at the Old Trafford is far from certain and the club are willing to massively cut his asking price to get him off their books.",
      "Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers is also a player Chelsea are keen on. The Englishman has just enjoyed his best season to date and the Blues may consider making a bid for the 22-year-old, who scored a career-best 14 times last term.",
      "Chelsea's interest comes despite them adding three major names to their frontline this summer. They've spent well over £100million to land Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens with some of them helping the Blues claim Club World Cup glory in America recently.",
      "The prize money from that success has helped their balance sheet and allowed them to continue investing, but they still need to get players out the door. Their transfer activity from here on is still somewhat dependent on individuals departing Stamford Bridge.",
      "Noni Madueke has just completed a move to Arsenal which has banked the club £50m. Christopher Nkunku is expected to leave the club and Joao Felix has also been told he can depart west London with Benfica, where he first made his name, interested in re-signing him.",
      "Nicolas Jackson, despite being the team's main man in attack last term, is by no means assured of his future and could be moved on if a suitable offer comes in. United have been credited with interest as they eye a new No 9 and the likes of Pedro and Delap could impact on Jackson's playing time."

      "It was on his only Manchester United pre-season tour in 2019 that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted to journalists how much more he enjoyed speaking to us without any cameras present.",
      "In the first press conference of that tour, Solskjaer hamfistedly suggested that there was a \"media agenda\" against Paul Pogba. Days before flying to Perth, Pogba said it was \"maybe time for a new challenge somewhere else\".",
      "United protected Pogba and pandered to him time and again. Ed Woodward would emphasise how popular he was with teammates and that he liked his agent, Mino Raiola.",
      "It came at great cost. The late Raiola declared it was \"over\" for Pogba on the eve of United's decisive Champions League group game with RB Leipzig in 2020. United lost and went out. They never entertained selling Pogba and he ran down his contract for the second time in 2022, ten years on from the first.",
      "Indulging a wantaway during a pre-season tour undermines the manager. Solskjaer was saddled with Pogba and Romelu Lukaku six years ago. Erik ten Hag was in a more invidious position last year with Jadon Sancho, foisted back onto him by the Ineos brains trust.",
      "Sancho never apologised to Ten Hag for accusing him of lying over his squad absence against Arsenal in September 2023. Ten Hag had to swallow his pride, reintegrate Sancho during pre-season and play him in friendlies.",
      "Ten Hag handled the matter so tactfully that Sancho performed respectably during United's three-game tour of the States 12 months ago. At the end of it, Ten Hag even suggested Sancho could start the season up front in the absence of the injured Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "When Sancho emerged in the Community Shield last year, there were no boos. The days when United fans prided themselves on not booing the team or one of their own are long gone and they have been a recurring soundtrack in recent seasons. Sancho actually drew applause when he trudged to the penalty spot in the shootout.",
      "Amusingly, Sancho was not in the squad for the first Premier League game against Fulham. He travelled to Brighton eight days later and did not make the matchday cut, either. Then he was gone as Chelsea took him off United's hands, but only temporarily. It is regrettable Sancho outlasted Ten Hag, whose dwindling authority was harmed by the return of Sancho to the fold.",
      "A year on, Sancho is still marooned at United but not going on tour. When he was incongruously mentioned at a Ruben Amorim press conference in February, Amorim hardly acknowledged his existence. The chances are the two have never actually met.",
      "There is no resale value to preserve with Sancho and he belongs in the bomb squad. He has had a feckless four years at United, publicly challenged the manager and revelled in the \"freedom\" of Marcus Rashford's loan move to Aston Villa.",
      "One of the benefits of the profitability and sustainability rules is that they calculate a player's worth and effectively set a ballpark figure for a prospective transfer. Sancho is not worth much: £14.58million.",
      "Interested clubs are not daft, either. They were not going to cough up more millions if Sancho tore it up in the Premier League Summer Series for United in the States.",
      "The senior players who have travelled with United to Chicago could all feasibly be in the squad after the transfer window closes at 7pm on September 1. Accommodating Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia would have raised more questions than answers.",
      "It also tallies with the unequivocal backing United are showing Amorim. Garnacho is up for sale a year after he was deemed unsellable as he has crossed the manager one time too many.",
      "There was an argument for Amorim to compromise with Garnacho. Yes, Garnacho is hot-headed, his brother is a nuisance and he reckons he is the finished article, yet he is a winger with a world-class ceiling and one developed by United. If the mythical United Way is such a thing, Garnacho embodies it on the pitch with his flair and industry. He does not go into hiding.",
      "Off it is another matter altogether. He can be inattentive, aloof, puerile and confrontational. He tested Ten Hag on a couple of occasions, the first time as far back as his first tour in 2022.",
      "A United manager's leniency should only stretch so far. Garnacho was Ten Hag's academy legacy. Amorim has inherited him and the system he swears by was always liable to rub Garnacho up the wrong way. The irony is Garnacho made a decent fist of operating as an infield winger.",
      "But zoning out during a tactical briefing, skulking down the tunnel after dubiously being substituted and then questioning the manager's selection (even if he did have a point about Mason Mount starting ahead of him in the Europa League final) was unedifying. United cannot allow the manager's authority to erode by keeping a player who doesn't want to be there.",
      "Which is what they did with Pogba."

      "The squad flew out to the United States on Tuesday and are now busy preparing for their second pre-season friendly of the summer. The tour of the US will see them play three matches, all against Premier League opposition in West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "New signing Bryan Mbeumo will be under the spotlight at the MetLife Stadium this weekend after finalising his move to United from Brentford on Monday. He has joined the club on a five-year contract in a deal that could be worth up to £71million.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has taken 32 players to the US. So what could the starting XI look like against the Hammers this weekend? Amorim's squad features a blend of youth and experience, meaning he will have the opportunity to mix things up throughout the tour.",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana is unlikely to feature because of a hamstring injury, meaning Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton will be eyeing a starting berth.",
      "Heaton was introduced at half-time in last Saturday's 0-0 draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and made a handful of important saves in the second half, the best of which denied Largie Ramazani. Bayindir, meanwhile, looked jittery every time the ball went into his 18-yard box.",
      "After being introduced at the break for the second half at the Strawberry Arena, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven will be eyeing starts in New Jersey. They flanked Harry Maguire in the two wide centre-backs spots against Leeds.",
      "Maguire did not travel with his teammates to the US on Tuesday for personal reasons but has confirmed he will meet up with the squad on Wednesday. Either Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt will start in the middle of the back three and the latter could be given the nod.",
      "What Amorim will determine as Mbeumo's best position in his 3-4-2-1 system remains to be seen. Arriving as a natural winger, he will be capable of operating at either right-wing or as the right-sided No.10.",
      "If Amorim views Mbeumo as a player that will continue to operate out wide, he should start at right wing-back, offering the United supporters a first chance to catch a glimpse of the club's latest recruit. Patrick Dorgu, who started on the bench against Leeds, will be eyeing his first start of pre-season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes started in midfield against Leeds, partnering Casemiro, suggesting that will be his permanent position this season. Kobbie Mainoo was bright after coming on at half-time and will be itching to start against the Hammers.",
      "If Mbeumo is deployed from the start on the flank, Amad is a logical starter as the right-sided No.10. He started at wing-back in Stockholm but was instructed to trade places with Collyer midway through the half.",
      "Matheus Cunha is a likely starter in the other No.10 spot after storing 45 minutes under his belt last weekend. He will be hoping to bag another start and increase his minutes.",
      "United are yet to solve their search for a striker, meaning Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi are competing for the No.9 spot. The former will be hoping to start and play alongside Cunha for the first time.",
      "United's strongest XI vs West Ham: Heaton; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Mbeumo, Mainoo, Fernandes, Dorgu; Amad, Cunha; Hojlund."

      "Antony is back in Manchester - while United's squad has jetted off to the USA for their pre-season tour. The Brazilian, 25, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis, is one of five Manchester United players to have informed the club of his desire to explore different opportunities this summer.",
      "The former Ajax man scored nine goals and provided five assists in 26 appearances during a successful loan spell at Betis and the La Liga side want to re-sign him. However, Manuel Pellegrini's side face competition from Atletico Madrid, who have emerged as the favourites to secure his signature.",
      "Reports have claimed that Atletico have moved to the front of the queue and United will let Antony leave if any club matches their valuation of the player, which is in excess of £30million. Erik ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen are among the others that have been linked with a move for the Selecao star.",
      "But Ten Hag appeared to rule out a reunion this summer. Speaking to German publication Bild, as quoted by Sports Mole, Ten Hag said: \"He has great quality. I signed him twice.",
      "\"He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
      "While rumours have increased around Antony's future, he posted a picture on Instagram on Tuesday showing that he is back in Manchester. The United forward put up an image of him in a LeBron James basketball shirt on Instagram, showing the location and the fact he has arrived back in Manchester.",
      "Antony, who returned to the Brazil squad last month for Carlo Ancelotti's first camp, spent most of June in Sao Paolo and appeared to enjoy some time on holiday following another long season.",
      "But as the month progressed, Antony started to post videos of him training in the gym and back on the grass, aiming to keep sharp and continue the form he showed at the back end of last campaign.",
      "United returned to pre-season training at the start of July but Antony, along with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia, have not been spotted with the rest of the squad.",
      "Indeed, Antony, Rashford, Sancho, Garnacho and Malacia have not travelled to the United States for United's pre-season tour. None of the five featured against Leeds United on Saturday and are expected to leave.",
      "Antony joined United from Ajax for £82m in August 2022 and he made an instant impact, scoring on his debut against Arsenal. His first season at Old Trafford wasn't a disaster, netting 10 times and adding five assists in 40 appearances, as the Reds won the Carabao Cup and finished third in the Premier League.",
      "However, that is as good as it has got for Antony at United. In fact, he has since scored just twice in 56 matches for the Reds, registering zero assists in that period.",
      "His loan, therefore, to Betis was much-needed and he showed what he is all about in Seville, helping them reach the Conference League final."

      "Manchester United's delight after completing the signing of Bryan Mbeumo on Monday will have been tempered after taking one look at the Christmas schedule.",
      "Following a prolonged negotiation period with Brentford, United managed to complete the signing of the 25-year-old for a fee worth approximately £70m. The Bees fought hard to keep hold of their forward despite Mbeumo being adamant that he wanted to join the Reds.",
      "MEN Sport understands United are disgruntled by the manner in which Brentford handled negotiations for Mbeumo. And, they are unlikely to be any happier when they take a look at the schedule for the forthcoming season.",
      "United's hectic Christmas schedule starts on December 20 against Aston Villa before playing three matches in a week against Newcastle, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leeds. A trip to Burnley comes up a few days later before the FA Cup third round.",
      "The Reds will then officially end their busy schedule on January 17 when they face Manchester City in the derby. Unfortunately for them, Mbeumo is likely to play his last game of the festive period against Villa before joining his Cameroonian teammates for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Mbeumo, if fit, is more than likely to be called up to the side and if he is, he will be guaranteed to miss the Newcastle, Wolves and probably Leeds matches. Should Cameroon get out of the group stages, which is expected, he will then miss the Burnley match too.",
      "As one of the favourites, Cameroon will be aiming to reach the final and if they complete their target, Mbeumo will miss the FA Cup third round match and the big derby as the final will be played on the same weekend. In total, there is a real possibility that the 25-year-old misses six domestic matches over Christmas which could pose a big problem for United during a crucial period of the season."

      "It is the he-said-she-said season. If we are to take Manchester United at face value, they beat Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United to the signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "One imagines some of those clubs would contest the strength of their interest in Mbeumo. Tottenham and Newcastle's was certainly genuine. So much so that. there were some typically theatrical reaction from sections of the latter at how United could possibly afford Mbeumo.",
      "Thomas Frank's switch from Brentford to Spurs prompted a sudden and serious approach. Mbeumo cherishes Frank for helping him to develop into one of the most productive forwards in the Premier League but he was set on joining United.",
      "A United source said Mbeumo \"never budged\". United did not budge when Brentford demanded an up-front fee of at least £70million. Having gone the entirety of last summer without breaking the £60m barrier for a signing, the no-go figure has been upped to £70m this summer.",
      "There was a pro and con of Matheus Cunha's release clause. It made his signing swift and straightforward for United but also raised the price of Mbeumo, such a similar profile of player he was born only a few months later. The Cameroon international has played twice as long in the Premier League and scored five more league goals last term. He is also slightly younger. On those counts, he is arguably a more valuable asset.",
      "But United have got the two prime targets for their positions. They have remained coy on Mbeumo's specific role but it is unlikely to be up front. Club sources were careful not to bill them as their \"top two targets\", mindful of the need for a new goalscorer.",
      "That said, United were keen to highlight that only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Ollie Watkins - four strikers - have scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in the past three years. Whatever the mitigation of such a stat, it is a genuinely impressive return from a winger who was operating at a stable mid-table side.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are not statement signings. United prised the best players from Brentford and Wolves. But they are statements of intent.",
      "Only seven players tallied more league goals than Cunha last season. Salah, Haaland and Isak were the three above Mbeumo in the charts. The clear caveat is that it will be trickier for the pair to match their goals hauls at the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "Arsenal were in for Cunha in the winter transfer window and at least two Champions League qualifiers wanted Mbeumo. United believe committing £133.5m on two signings reiterates their football first approach, an old line that they are still prone to trotting out.",
      "More significant is United retain some clout even after their worst season in 51 years. Yes, they moved for convenient targets at clubs lower down the food chain but there was concrete competition.",
      "Mbeumo is arguably more of a coup than Cunha, whose ill-discipline was a deterrent for some admirers. Mbeumo's character seems sound and he could have had an easier life, staying in London, reuniting with Frank and playing in the Champions League for Tottenham.",
      "A close relative of Mbeumo's is a United fan. Mbeumo revealed United was \"the team whose shirt I wore growing up\" in his unveiling statement. That may convince undecided fans to get 'Mbeumo 19' on the back of their new replica.",
      "There is a more bullish tone about United this summer. Twelve months ago, every significant decision that was taken during pre-season revolved around the manager and posed more questions than it answered.",
      "Keeping Erik ten Hag having looked to sack him and extending his contract rather than offering a renewal undermined the club's apparent confidence. Anyone who could see the wood for the trees could see United had gone past the point of no return under Ten Hag before they punched above their weight in the FA Cup final.",
      "The irony is Ruben Amorim presided over a Premier League finish that was almost twice as bad as Ten Hag's in 2023-24. Yet Amorim is Ineos' man. Amorim has seen off Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho amid unequivocal backing. You can count Dan Ashworth, too, given he was opposed to the choice of Amorim as head coach and favoured a British option.",
      "This is Amorim's first full season and he will not be afforded anywhere near as much slack as he was during those months when United prioritised the Europa League at the cost of their domestic form. There have been substantial squad investments in time for the pre-season tour and an XI with Mbeumo, Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Amad has to climb the league table.",
      "The squad is still short of a proven goalscorer, there is a potential midfield minefield if that area is not enhanced, and Andre Onana does not instil confidence in the majority of supporters. The transfer window is open for just under six more weeks and at least one more starting signing is targeted. That has to be a number nine.",
      "For now, they have Mbeumo with the '9' in his squad number, drawing envious glances from north London and Tyneside."

      "Rashford has put in the hours over the summer. His Instagram account, almost certainly run by his brother and former agent, Dwaine, has charted a rigorous training schedule of gym-work and ball-work. Rashford spent four hours in a Salford gym last Monday.",
      "Hangers-on weighed Rashford down in recent years but his entourage on holiday in Cannes were on the grass with him. He was joined by brothers Dwaine, Dane, cousin Lois and former United academy teammate Roshaun Williams.",
      "Rashford shone at Camp Nou in United's engrossing 2-2 Europa League knockout draw in February 2023, scoring their equaliser and single-handedly forcing Jules Kounde's own goal. He was at his zenith that season, with the caveat that Rashford's form came with his camp in the midst of contract negotiations.",
      "Have a glance at Rashford's goals tallies over the past four seasons: five, 30, eight and seven. You can pinpoint the one that preceded a lucrative salary hike.",
      "Despite that 30-goal season, privately he bristled at some of Erik ten Hag's methods and how dogmatic the Dutchman could be. Their working relationship disintegrated during Ten Hag's final year at United.",
      "Rashford was irritated to start the 2023-24 season up front while Rasmus Hojlund recovered from a stress fracture of the back. At Villa, Unai Emery regularly played Rashford through the middle. Lewandowski, 37, is not showing many signs of slowing down but he is out of contract at Barcelona next year.",
      "After Amorim discounted Rashford from selection, the player exercised some moderate PR, attending a game in his hospitality box at Old Trafford. There was polite applause from the Stretford End on his final squad appearance when he warmed up against Newcastle in December.",
      "Figures at United are continuing to tread on eggshells with Rashford, still keen to highlight his legacy as one of their most striking academy graduates. Rashford has long since abandoned diplomacy, thanking Alejandro Garnacho for his puerile post in a Villa 'Rashford 9' shirt last month.",
      "One down, three to go for United. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Garnacho will, by hook or by crook, be gone by 7pm on September 1. United will then have a leaner, fresher and more harmonious forward line. One that has to be sharpened by a new striker.",
      "They need to be fussed about that."

      "\"Yeah, for sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best. Hopefully... We'll see.\"",
      "Those words came from Marcus Rashford last month when a Spanish influencer asked whether he would like to play with supremely talented Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal.",
      "Rashford has been fluttering his eyelashes at Barcelona, and he will realise his goal of playing for the Catalan club. Manchester United have agreed to send Rashford on loan for the 2025/2026 season and Barcelona will cover his entire wage packet throughout his stay at Camp Nou.",
      "The 27-year-old was one of five players who were told to delay their returns to Carrington after each expressed a desire to leave. United have arranged Rashford's exit with favourable terms and now must address the futures of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia to offset incomings.",
      "United have not sold Rashford on a permanent deal, but removing one of the highest earners from the books is a boost, and Barcelona are expected to trigger their option to sign him at the end of the season.",
      "It feels inevitable Rashford will show enough for Barcelona to activate their option to sign him. He may well impress and pundits will then doubtless suggest United made a mistake by allowing him to leave.",
      "The script with Rashford over the next 12 months at Barcelona is predictable, but it will be a surprise if he can sustain strong performances across successive seasons in Spain.",
      "United's attention now turns to the four other players on the naughty step. Garnacho retains the highest value and arranging his sale will unlock much-needed funds for Ruben Amorim.",
      "An initial £127.5million has been splashed on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, so selling Garnacho is now at the top of the transfer agenda.",
      "Chelsea and Napoli were interested during the January transfer window. The winger's agent attended a game at Stamford Bridge and told the world he was there by posting on social media.",
      "The suggestion is that Garnacho would prefer to remain in the Premier League, but United will try to offload him to the highest bidder because. They should be trying to get £50million-plus for a player who has proven himself in the Premier League and still has considerable upside. The only problem is potential suitors know Amorim wants rid.",
      "Antony deserves credit for creating a market for himself. The Brazilian was utterly hopeless in Manchester but looked a completely new player during his loan with Real Betis last season.",
      "If you pretend his £86m transfer to United never happened, Antony would look like a decent prospect and a permanent move to a European club is on the cards for him this summer.",
      "United must sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR loss. The club will also look to negotiate a permanent deal for Jadon Sancho and the Italian press claim Juventus are advancing.",
      "Juventus will be asked to cough up a fee for Sancho, although United will get peanuts from the last player of the out-of-favour-five, Tyrell Malacia, who looked unconvincing during his PSV loan last term.",
      "The nightmare scenario was that all five players would still be at Old Trafford near the end of the window, but United have shifted Rashford and it's hoped the floodgates will now open for the other exits."

The Reds fly out to the US on Tuesday and will spend the best part of a fortnight on the other side of the Atlantic.",
      "Their pre-season tour will feature friendlies against Premier League counterparts West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. Each game will represent an opportunity for head coach Ruben Amorim to experiment.",
      "By the time United return to England and prepare for their final friendly of the summer - a clash with Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9 - Amorim will almost certainly have an idea in his mind of what his strongest starting XI looks like.",
      "United face Arsenal in their Premier League at Old Trafford on August 17 and will be determined to hit the ground running after last season's struggles.",
      "Although there is still just under a month to go until their Premier League curtain-raiser, some places in Amorim's starting XI are already nailed down. The likes of Leny Yoro, Patrick Dorgu, Bruno Fernandes, Mathes Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will all believe they are guaranteed starters.",
      "Occupants of other positions within the XI remain to be decided, with United's four remaining friendlies set to dictate Amorim's thinking.",
      "The Portuguese chief's decision to start Fernandes in the middle of midfield for the draw with Leeds felt particularly telling. Following the addition of Cunha, the feeling throughout the summer has been that Fernandes will start the new campaign in midfield.",
      "Cunha operated as the left-sided No.10 in Stockholm and Toby Collyer, much to everyone's surprise, started as the right-sided No.10. Mbemo and Amad will be the leading contenders to occupy that role come mid-August.",
      "Casemiro and Fernandes started alongside each other in midfield in Stockholm before Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte were partnered together for the second half. United were better after the break and Mainoo was a bright spark.",
      "Amorim struggled to determine Mainoo's best position last season, tasking him as either a No.8 or as one of the playmakers. On Saturday's evidence, Mainoo looks more than comfortable in midfield.",
      "However, he was playing alongside Ugarte, who is a defensive specialist, meaning the England international had the freedom to get forward and be adventurous with the ball. If he starts the season next to Fernandes, he will not have that luxury amid the latter's hunger to attack.",
      "To ensure United, who still want to sign a midfielder this summer, strike the right balance in the engine room, Ugarte and Fernandes look the best partnership on paper. Ugarte is an excellent ball-winner and his qualities compliment Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo, though, will believe he has lost time to make up for after a stop-start 2024/25 campaign. However, the prospect of him and Fernandes working side-by-side could leave United vulnerable and potentially exposed in the middle.",
      "Casemiro returned for pre-season looking leaner and fitter, meaning he will be refusing to give up hope of becoming a regular starter this season.",
      "The three US friendlies and the clash with Fiorentina in M16 next month could settle this conundrum for Amorim.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

Mbeumo arrives in time to join the bulk of the club's pre-season training, and he could make his first appearance against West Ham in the Premier League Summer Series tour in the US this weekend.",
      "Between Mbeumo and fellow summer signing, Matheus Cunha, United have poached two of the top-ten Premier League goal-scorers from last season. Addressing Ruben Amorim's misfiring attack was a key problem to solve in the summer transfer, and these two may well go some way to inspiring some fear in opposition defensive lines yet again if they can replicate anything like last season's form.",

Reader LesJohnson says: \"Cunha and Mbuemo are the first steps in the right direction. There is nothing much wrong with our goals against, and it was obvious to everybody we need to put away our chances, we created enough of them.",

We can out-score most teams with these guys and that was our Achilles Heel last season, not scoring enough, only 44 in a season is inept as we all know.",
      "\"Compliment to our directors for getting these deals done and proving the doubters wrong. United will be back, maybe not at the very top, but teams will now start to fear us yet again.\"",

Both these lads will definitely improve our attacking play. If we can get in a new goalkeeper, and an energetic midfielder to replace Casemiro, I'm confident United will challenge for a spot in the top-seven of the Premier League.\"",

      "After a month of negotiations, Manchester United have officially signed Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The transfer has been a long time coming and fans were relieved to see the announcement on Monday, which confirmed the £65million signing, with a further £6m potentially due in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has signed a five-year contract with the option of another year, and the forward will travel to the United States on Tuesday with his new teammates for the pre-season tour.",
      "It was important to complete a deal in time for Mbeumo to feature in the US and United got the transfer over the line in the end, despite discussions with Brentford dragging on.",
      "Some fans were concerned when Mbeumo had not signed in time for the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm, but that game was essentially a training exercise.",
      "It wouldn't have made much difference if Mbeumo had travelled to Sweden last weekend, although it was obvious why United wanted him to arrive ahead of their trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The USA tour will provide Amorim with the opportunity to intensely work with his players across the next fortnight. The Reds boss will hope to lay the foundations for a successful campaign while in the States.",
      "Mbeumo needed to be a part of that, partly because he needs to adapt and partly because discussions rumbling on for any longer could have forced United to finally walk away from the player.",
      "United have received some flak for taking so long to sign Mbeumo. However, he will feature in America, which is a huge positive, and it was important that the structure of the deal was deemed fair.",
      "Brentford will receive the fee they wanted from the start, but United did not surrender to their demands immediately, submitting two unsuccessful bids before a breakthrough, and negotiating a favourable deal structure.",
      "The London club held the aces during talks. Mbeumo had entered the final year of his contract, but Brentford had the option of extending by 12-months, which helped their bargaining power.",
      "The player indicated his desire to move to Manchester, though, which has been key during the transfer saga over the last month. He desperately wanted a summer switch to United.",
      "The Cameroon international completed his medical over the weekend and was pictured in a suit at Carrington - appearances go a long way and Mbeumo has already made a good first impression.",
      "Rival fans have questioned the transfer fee, but they only need to look at the market for home truths. Anthony Elanga (six goals) signed for Newcastle in a £50m deal, Chelsea signed Jamie Gittens (12 goals) from Borussia Dortmund for £51.5m and Noni Madueke (11 goals) signed for Arsenal for £48.5m.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League - his statistics weren't inflated by cup competitions - and also contributed eight assists, so the initial £65m fee seems like fair market value.",

Mkhitaryan was in Manchester the following day and on the plane to China.",

In 2015, Matteo Darmian, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin all signed over the weekend before United departed for Seattle and images of the newbies were predictably lapped up.",
      "Romelu Lukaku was already in Los Angeles, holidaying with Paul Pogba, when United flew there for their buoyant 2017 tour. United had agreed a club record fee for Lukaku (rising to £90m) and had blindsided Chelsea to sign him from Everton. Such a move, after a Europa League triumph in May, maintained the feel-good factor.",
      "That was in stark contrast to Mourinho's fraught final tour in 2018, overshadowed by briefing and counter-briefing. After congratulating his daughter, Matilde, on her graduation, Mourinho's first words at his opening press conference at the UCLA were \"our pre-season is very bad\".",
      "He publicly demanded two more signings and never got them. Ed Woodward dodged Mourinho across four different states and was eventually spotted hurriedly catching up with him in the bowels of the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Woodward looked like he was caught between a rock and a hard place.",
      "One of the senior United players in Los Angeles was hesitant about a media activity due to the manager's \"bad mood\". It did not improve in Phoenix, Ann Arbor or Florida and Woodward questioned a prospective employee on how to deal with Mourinho's outbursts.",
      "Woodward never truly recovered from his first summer as executive vice-chairman in 2013. He breezily briefed that he had left the tour in Australia on \"urgent transfer business\". Cesc Fabregas was leading him down the garden path.",
      "The high point of David Moyes's reign came at the start when he got his hands on the Community Shield. His mood afterwards was tetchy as reporters grilled him on the Fabregas collapse. Moyes accused some of writing \"untruths\". Moyes was already unravelling after an exhausting pre-season in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong.",
      "2018 was the last tour where a United manager did not agree to the traditional sit-down with the travelling British journalists. Mourinho felt he was lacking allies and he derided a member of the communications department's suggestion on how to counter the criticism.",
      "Ruben Amorim's tan suggests he has enjoyed plenty of sun during his downtime and his demeanour should be sunnier than his compatriot's seven years ago. United players are already buoyed by the breakthrough for Bryan Mbeumo, likely to be unveiled before they touch down in Chicago on Tuesday.",
      "Having Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha on the plane and, hopefully, on the MetLife pitch against West Ham United next Saturday will change the perception of a team that has recorded a minus goal difference in successive seasons.",
      "Amorim did not speak to the travelling journalists in Stockholm on Saturday but is scheduled to address the press in Chicago on Friday. The line of questioning will not be as intense with two £130m forwards added to a blunt attack.",
      "United are close to a settled XI: Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt were among the first recruits of the Ineos era, Harry Maguire had his contract extended in the New Year, Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte arrived within the last 12 months, Bruno Fernandes committed through a new contract last year and the rejection of the Saudi Pro League this, while Amad was also tied down on new terms.",
      "The issues are at the back and up front. United have prioritised their attack over the goalkeeper and the timing of Andre Onana's injury could work in his favour ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "The more pressing matter is the striker. With Joshua Zirkzee back in Manchester nursing a minor injury, Rasmus Hojlund did not even start against Leeds United. Amorim picked a rotational XI that was demonstrably not the strongest available to him, with two auxiliary centre backs in the back three and rookie Diego Leon in from the start.",
      "Yet there was possibly something to read into Chido Obi's inclusion. His performance and goals in the post-season tour win in Hong Kong did him no harm. Hojlund's form that night was identical to his competitive outings and he does not have the confidence of the United manager or supporters.",
      "But Obi cannot lead the line for United in four weeks' time. By the time Arsenal's coach pulls into Old Trafford, United best have made that third player official."

      "Lazio picked him up from Real Madrid for around £5million in July 2022, and he’s gone on to play 84 times for the Italian giants, scoring two goals.",
      "Comfortable and confident on the ball, Gila is an astute defender and would be a top signing for any big club looking to bolster their defence.",
      "",
      "9) Ousmane Diomande (Sporting)\nThe Ivorian has previously been linked with Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham, but FA Cup winners Crystal Palace seem the most likely, even if that rumour has gone very quiet.",
      "Jarell Quansah’s move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen hasn’t quite triggered a transfer domino effect in the Premier League, though the Premier League champions have ramped up their pursuit of Palace captain Marc Guehi. No bid has been made or seems close, but if he leaves the Eagles, Oliver Glasner must get his replacement right. Diomande would be a coup and a safe option in that regard.",
      "READ: Palace should be ‘genuinely astounded’ by Arsenal, Liverpool part-exchange offers for Eze and Guehi",
      "",
      "8) Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)\nThere are question marks over two things: Scalvini’s availability and Scalvini’s injury record. One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",
      "",
      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes on April Fool’s Day, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently, that’s the world we live in now.",
      "",
      "6) Antonio Silva (Benfica)\nChelsea and Manchester United are among the clubs to be linked with the Benfica defender, who apparently “wants Juventus”, per his agent Jorge Mendes.",
      "Benfica are known to be difficult negotiators, and talks over Silva will likely be no exception. He’s expected to be the next big-money sale after ex-Red Devils youngster Alvaro Carreras joined Real Madrid earlier this summer.",

Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often…for my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t lure Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",

Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",
      "Bade did get a decent move to Rennes for £15m when he was 21, but it didn’t really happen for him there. Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",
      "The French international helped Sevilla win the Europa League in his first six months and signed permanently for around £10m. He’s been a top signing and is ready for a proper crack at the Premier League.",
      "",
      "3) Carlos Lukeba (RB Leipzig)\nReal Madrid are one of the clubs being linked with the 22-year-old, which does a lot of the talking for us, really.",
      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option with another French ex-Leipzig defender, Ibrahima Konate, being fiercely linked with Real Madrid.",
      "He has a €90m (£77.5m) release clause, which surely won’t be triggered this summer. It’ll be interesting to see Leipzig’s stance if offers come in, especially with Benjamin Sesko likely to stay.",
      "",
      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",
      "The Burkina Faso defender played 46 times for Leverkusen in 2023/24, when they lost just once all season, in the Europa League final against Atalanta.",
      "He featured nine times in the Champions League and is clearly good enough to make the step up, if he so desires. Leverkusen are still a very good side, even without Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong; we wouldn’t blame him for staying.",
      "Transfer speculation has significantly died down, but all it takes is one Fabrizio Romano post on X, folks, and then every club is interested.",
      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa Conference League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",
      "There’s no real competition for Guehi here, in my opinion. He’s absolutely brilliant. He’s the future of England’s defence and deserves to be playing for a Champions League club.",
      "READ NEXT: Palace should be ‘genuinely astounded’ by Arsenal, Liverpool part-exchange offers for Eze and Guehi",
      "Liverpool could switch their focus to Aston Villa centre-back Ezri Konsa this summer if a deal for Marc Guehi becomes difficult, according to reports.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed that he believes Crystal Palace are “looking to cash in” on Liverpool target Marc Guehi this summer.",
      "Crystal Palace are “doing everything they can” to keep Jean-Philippe Mateta at Selhurst Park amid interest from Liverpool, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool have reportedly ‘submitted a record bid’ for Newcastle United star Alexander Isak, while their sixth summer signing hinges on one condition.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly ready to make a £40m offer for Marc Guehi in a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ attempt to sign the Crystal Palace star this summer.",
      "Liverpool are ‘watching’ two centre-backs as alternatives to Marc Guehi as they consider ‘reverting’ to their ‘preferred profile’ this summer."

      "Liverpool are linked with a Villa defender and a Real Madrid star who could be lumped into a package deal to lure away Manchester City’s captain…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Rodri – Man City to Real Madrid\nWe’re told that Real are offering Eduardo Camavinga, Rodrygo and €40million for Rodri. Real probably value that package at around £170million. Which feels like a lot for a player coming off the back of a serious knee injury. But probably still not enough for City to seriously consider.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Ezri Konsa – Aston Villa to Liverpool\nA report in Spain suggests Liverpool could alter their focus to the ‘slightly more affordable’ Konsa since Palace are looking for £50million to sell Marc Guehi a year before he goes for free. Konsa is under contract until 2028 – would Villa demand less for him than what Palace are demanding for Guehi? We think not.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool are monitoring Rodrygo if Luis Diaz leaves. The Reds are insisting on top whack for Diaz, who is set to be the subject of an improved offer from Bayern. Real too were looking for around £86million for Rodrygo but they have since accepted they may have to settle for less. In that context, it makes sense but still somehow doesn’t pass the sniff test.",

      "",
      "17) 🆕 Kobbie Mainoo – Manchester United to Tottenham\nSpurs have made an enquiry to United over Mainoo, whose contract talks with his boyhood club are not progressing as quickly as either side might hope. That shouldn’t prompt panic, though, since the midfielder’s current terms expire in 2027 and United have the option to go for another 12 months beyond that. Still, does Mainoo fit Ruben Amorim’s system? He might be their best chance of getting some decent money in this summer.",
      "",
      "16) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Manchester United\nUnited continue to be linked with Jackson but we hear that Chelsea have valued him at between £80million and £100million. If you’re not going to take it seriously, lads. We could see this happening, probably late and something exchange-y involving Alejandro Garnacho. But not if Chelsea keep pretending they want the silliest of money.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho is being linked with Chelsea and Spurs but the noise seems to be building around Villa. Morgan Rogers to Chelsea, then Garnacho to Villa? The Villans would turn a profit from any such dealing and if they sit tight, they could get Garnacho for even less than the current asking price of around £40million. If they are really clever, they could probably get him on loan.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it all seemed a bit weird on Saturday when Isak was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Maybe this one isn’t done?",
      "",
      "13) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nIt was thought Xhaka might be heading for the riches of Saudi but instead he fancies the splendour of Sunderland. Indeed, the ex-Arsenal midfielder has told Leverkusen he only wants to move to the Stadium of Light while urging the German club to do a deal quickly. Those pleas, though, appear to have fallen on deaf ears, with Erik ten Hag insisting Leverkusen have already lost too many key players this summer.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham’\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "9) Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. Only problem now is they need to deal with Brentford, who have already lost one forward to Manchester United. Given the Bees know Newcastle were prepared to spend big on Hugo Ekitike or Joao Pedro, the Magpies can expect a rough ride. They will have to try a lot harder than £25million.",
      "",
      "8) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "7) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao but the sales of Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah will allow the Old Lady to sign Sancho too. Agreements are said to be in place with both United and Sancho, who should be thanking his lucky stars even if he’s halving his salary. How will he cope?",
      "",
      "6) James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "5) Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one doesn’t seem to have moved in since Forest saw their arse over Spurs randomly plucking the same number out of the sky that appears on Gibbs-White contract under the buy-out clause. Forest threatened legal action and since then… nothing. The player is missing from Forest’s pre-season trip to Portugal but that’s to stay behind with his heavily pregnant partner. What now? For this to go through, Spurs must suss that they are legally on solid ground and pursue the deal at the cost of their original offer; or they sweeten the deal for Forest to sell a player who wants to move.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nAfter bemoaning the abject lack of progress in the last week, it seems we finally have some. Ornstein reckons Sporting and Arsenal are ‘on the verge of total agreement’. Which is where we thought they were but, apparently, a ‘conclusion is imminent’. Which is something we can all be thankful for.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nRashford is in Barcelona having secured the ‘dream’ move even he would struggle to argue that he deserves. A medical has been done and, all being well, Rashford will be doing kick-ups for the cameras on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nEkitike has landed in England – at least, he was scheduled to on Tuesday – for a medical and to sign his contract in London before immediately flying off again to join the rest of the Liverpool squad on tour.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThe delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer but this one has really dragged. Mosquera is heading for Singapore to join his new team-mates but still we wait.",

      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…",
      "We also have the best available strikers, attacking midfielders, wingers, and central defenders.",
      "",
      "10) Ardon Jashari (Club Brugge)\nA transfer to AC Milan appears likely, though the Italian side has yet to agree a fee with Club Brugge for the 22-year-old midfielder. Jashari has made it clear that Milan is his preferred destination, but if negotiations with the Belgian club continue to stall, a move elsewhere can’t be ruled out. Given his stance, playing for Brugge again seems unlikely.",
      "Since making his international debut in September 2022, Jashari has earned four caps and is expected to play a more significant role for his national team once Granit Xhaka retires from international football.",
      "He’s a fantastic, young defensive midfielder with Champions League experience, having helped Brugge reach the last 16 of Europe’s premier competition last season. They lost to Aston Villa after an incredible 5-2 aggregate win over Europa League holders Atalanta in the play-off round.",
      "",
      "9) Angelo Stiller (Stuttgart)\nIt’s unlikely that Stiller leaves Stuttgart this summer, but as a standout performer outside of the Champions League spotlight, he could be tempted by a bigger move.",
      "The 24-year-old four-cap Germany international signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract in January, with Fabrizio Romano confirming that ‘several clubs’ wanted to sign him in the summer transfer window.",
      "Valued at €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, Stiller played 47 times across all competitions last season, assisting an impressive 11 times from defensive midfield.",
      "",
      "8) Douglas Luiz (Juventus)\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder left England to ease Profit and Sustainability pressures last summer. He had been superb in 2023/24, but his debut season in Italy was anything but.",
      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from the Premier League. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",
      "",
      "7) Alan Varela (Porto)\nVarela is only 24 but still uncapped for Argentina, which is mildly baffling. He’s quietly become one of the best defensive midfielders in Portugal, and we expected more concrete interest from the continent by now.",
      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract in May.",
      "That alone makes him pretty unlikely to move this summer.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Gyokeres deal imminent; Simons in, Jackson out at Chelsea\n👉 Mbeumo has taken one of the biggest steps down in transfer history – but No.1 might never be beaten\n👉 Xhaka next? The most stunning transfer coups made by newly-promoted Premier League clubs",
      "",
      "6) Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich)\nOne of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League during his Fulham days, it just hasn’t happened for Palhinha at Bayern. He earned a deserved move last summer, but could be out the door again after just one season.",
      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign. At 29, he might prefer to stick around at a club like Bayern, where he’s only an injury or two away (to other Bayern players, obviously) from regular minutes under Vincent Kompany.",
      "",
      "5) Morten Hjulmand (Sporting)\nViktor Gyokeres is the headline-grabber at Sporting, on and off the pitch, having forced a transfer to Arsenal, but Hjulmand is catching plenty of admiring glances of his own.",
      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 26, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",
      "",
      "4) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",
      "A quiet summer involving a bit of Italian culture could be exactly what he needs. Clubs should be circling, because United might just let their most gifted academy graduate in decades leave for the right price.",
      "",
      "3) Andrey Santos (Chelsea)\nExpect to see a wave of Chelsea players spending time at Strasbourg, as Todd Boehly continues to treat the French club as his very own Vitesse.",
      "Santos was one of the most impressive midfielders in Ligue 1 last season and was the only returning loanee Enzo Maresca included in Chelsea’s Club World Cup squad, with Strasbourg team-mate Djordje Petrovic missing out and eventually moving to Bournemouth.",
      "Despite his huge ceiling, Chelsea seem happy to sell him to fund the next phase of their transfer binge, even if his replacement is worse and has less potential. Arsenal are reportedly sniffing around and need a bit more midfield depth following the exits of Jorginho and an unnamed Premier League footballer in his 30s.",
      "",
      "2) Carlos Baleba (Brighton)\nBrighton’s next mega-sale is likely to be Baleba, who’s quietly become one of the most complete young midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "Clubs might not think he’s worth £80m, but Brighton think he is, and they’re rarely wrong. They won’t sell for a penny less, either. They’re not quite Benfica levels of shrewd, but they’ve set the standard in England.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Atalanta)\nThere’s a good chance Ederson ends up in Saudi Arabia, with Al Hilal reportedly keen to sign him from Atalanta.",
      "The Saudi Arabian side have struggled to convince their top targets to join this summer and consistent snubs mean his name is rising on their shortlist.",
      "The 26-year-old often emerges as a Plan B for clubs chasing midfielders; Manchester City had him on standby if Tijjani Reijnders didn’t move, while United and Liverpool have been linked over the past year.",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Amorim has made up his mind and ‘the talk’ at Man Utd has now turned to where the midfielder might go and how much they can get for him.",
      "Manchester United have been warned against making the “crazy same mistake” with Kobbie Mainoo after they were wrong to sell another player last year."

      "Even if the deal suits the immediate needs of all involved, the details of the agreement that takes Marcus Rashford from Manchester United to Barcelona reflect well on none of the signatories.",
      "The two clubs are settling somewhat but Rashford, at least, has got what he really wanted and probably more than he deserves. In Catalonia right now, in between thanking his lucky stars, the 27-year-old is practising his keepie-uppies ahead of being officially unveiled as a Barca player.",
      "None of this is how Rashford should be leaving United. If you were told a couple of years ago that the academy graduate would be swapping Old Trafford for the Nou Camp, the expectation might have been for Rashford to be revered and waved off with the warmest wishes of everyone at his boyhood club, while United banked a massive fee following a decade of stellar service.",
      "Instead, after witnessing a couple of years of apathy, most Stretford End-ers will shrug wearily while Rashford becomes the chief beneficiary of Barca’s financial ineptitude that made their primary targets unattainable.",
      "Doubtless, some of United’s online fanbase will be somewhat more animated. Many of Paul Pogba’s loons latched on to Rashford as the subject of their fanaticism and, to them, the player could no wrong. It’s always the manager at Manchester United.",
      "The truth is, for the breakdown of the bond between Rashford and United, there is plenty of blame to go around.",
      "Rashford can be excused a good deal of frustration over how his boyhood club was run for the most of the nine years since he burst into Louis van Gaal’s first-team. Too often in that time, he was one of the few certainties among the chaos and, as a local academy graduate, a throwback to the values United still claim to represent.",
      "As recently as two years ago, Rashford looked set to cement a hero’s legacy at United when he became the first player in the post-Ferguson era to score 30 goals in a season.",
      "Then he just seemed to get sick of it. All of it.",
      "You would have to be an extreme optimist to view as a mere coincidence the peak of Rashford’s performance coming around contract renewal time. Almost as soon as the ink was dry on a £325,000-a-week deal, Rashford’s form and focus vanished – only to be rediscovered this summer when it became clear that Barca might be an option after all.",
      "Perhaps only Rashford and those closest to him really understand what happened, but to many outsiders looking in, the love was gone. First for United, then football. Whatever might have been going on in his mind, he just looked thoroughly fed up with his lot.",
      "On the pitch, even pretending to press became too much of a chore. In possession, the blinkers narrowed. Not as they tend to on the most ruthless of marksmen; whether he simply lost faith in those around him – not unimaginable at United – it became about self before side. And by 2023, his questionable decision-making was no longer limited to between the white lines.",
      "MORE MARCUS RASHFORD COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Rashford’s Manchester United actions must speak far louder than his thousands of empty words\n👉 Rashford transfer ‘almost’ collapses but Manchester United ‘are the biggest winners’ of £25m loan",
      "It was a human response. Here was a lad still rooted in his hometown, earning wealth for generations in his mid-20s, carrying more of the burden than many of his team-mates for United’s failings. Many would struggle with such expectation in that environment. Especially when factions of the right-wing press were still going after him for the heinous act of feeding children at a time of national crisis.",
      "Rashford’s activism and advocacy, prompting more changes in government policy than any recent opposition party, should not be forgotten by a soul, least not anyone at United. They were more than happy to bathe in Rashford’s reflective glory. That pride should never fade.",
      "Those things considered – plus more than one debilitating injury through which he played, and upheaval in his personal life – few among us are entitled to judge Rashford harshly for allowing his halo to slip. Perhaps we should give him more credit for the fact it didn’t happen sooner.",
      "But since the back end of 2023, after signing his contract that summer, Rashford simply hasn’t seemed interested in rediscovering the form that earned that mega-deal. Even a pretence was too much. By the time Erik ten Hag was sacked, Rashford seemed to care not one jot how he was perceived by Ruben Amorim or anyone else at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim struggled to contain his befuddlement at the wider mess he inherited at United, but he saw no reason to sugar-coat the reality when it came to Rashford. “You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench, but I would put [goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn’t give the maximum every day.”",
      "That is damning. How bad must things have got with Rashford, since his partner in pre-derby crime, Alejandro Garnacho, continued to be used until Amorim could tolerate him no more?",
      "Amorim’s keeper coach craic came towards the end of a run of a dozen games Rashford sat out amid a transfer request of sorts. Not a real transfer request, of course. Why go to the bother of writing a letter that will cost millions in needlessly-sacrificed salary when you can just use Henry Winter’s X account to tell the world you are ‘ready for a new challenge’ and still get paid?",
      "The misguided belief among Rashford and his people seemed to be that he would have his pick of clubs in January. Barca were mentioned then; in terms of profile, AC Milan sounded a good match too. So perhaps it was slightly more humbling to find himself parked at Aston Villa rather than flying into a European giant.",
      "Even there, Rashford was on the bench more than Unai Emery’s starting XI in the Premier League, and when given the choice to sign the temporary No.9 on a permanent basis, the Villans thought better of it.",
      "All of which makes us wonder if this move to the actual FC Barcelona is a karmic consequence of all the child-feeding and Tory-bothering. Because, as Teddy Sheringham said, this is a grand opportunity that Rashford’s performances and mindset have not merited.",
      "Maybe he should be careful what he wished for. Rashford’s ‘dream’ of signing for Barca could turn sour very quickly if the financially-illiterate club is unable to register him with La Liga. Until they juggle their finances to creep back under the league’s salary limit, it remains a very real possibility.",
      "No-one back in his hometown wants Rashford thrust into that nightmare scenario, even if the stench of burnt bridges fills the Manchester air.",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford was reportedly told what he must to do succeed at Barcelona in a meeting with Hansi Flick.",
      "Man Utd’s Marcus Rashford faces a nervy wait to finalise his loan move to Barcelona amid a summer of issues for the Catalan club.",
      "Marcus Rashford was ‘almost scuppered’ in his mission to join Barcelona from Manchester United because of a slight delay from back-up airport of choice.",
      "Paul Pogba insists that Man Utd “are losing a great player” in Marcus Rashford ahead of an imminent transfer to La Liga side Barcelona.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has pondered whether Manchester United have “failed” Marcus Rashford as he looks to be on the way to a move to Barcelona."

The first came in 1937, with the following season ending in the drop to give the club the unwanted distinction of becoming the only reigning champions to suffer relegation.",

      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "",
      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",
      "While Manchester United were officially Premier League champions for a little under four more soul-sapping months, their star had already fallen by the time Mata’s helicopter landed at Carrington.",
      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",
      "He would loan Kim Kallstrom later that month in protest.",
      "Mata, on the other hand, will probably forever remain the top scorer of Ryan Giggs’ entire career as a club manager.",
      "",
      "Nemanja Matic – £40m in July 2017\nFrom: Chelsea (1st)\nTo: Manchester United (6th)",
      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Spurs (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Spurs claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker left the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus – £55m in July 2025",
      "From: West Ham (14th)\nTo: Spurs (17th)",
      "It is an unflattering reflection of both club and player that Kudus signed a West Ham contract containing an £80m release clause in summer 2023 and left for £25m less two years later.",
      "There were flashes of something exceptional over those 80 Hammers appearances under three different managers, but that wonderful first season being shown tapes of Steven Pienaar by David Moyes had faded long before Spurs swooped.",
      "Thomas Frank identified the Ghanaian as his priority signing, Kudus picked out Spurs as the only club he wished to join, West Ham swallowed their pride to fund much-needed squad improvements and Arne Slot looked on longingly.",
      "But 14th to 17th is barely a step down in comparison to what Morgan Gibbs-White is about to do.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo – £65m in July 2025",
      "From: Brentford (10th)\nTo: Manchester United (15th)",
      "There was indelible proof of Manchester United’s perennial transfer pull when what could have been a summer-long auction between a number of potential suitors was reduced to a staring contest between Ruben Amorim’s side and Brentford.",
      "Both parties felt they got the best out of a deal which took about two months to construct between the rejected opening bid and accepted third offer, with the bad blood likely to drip into next season.",
      "Manchester United brought Brentford to the table at £55m and left with Mbeumo in tow once the numbers surpassed £70m.",
      "For a player only beaten in terms of combined goals and assists in the 2024/25 Premier League season by Mo Salah and Alexander Isak, they will be content to have at least weakened one of the mid-table sides they must overtake on their way back up the ladder.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Noni Madueke have joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",
      "Man City have offered €170m (£147m) to Chelsea in order to bring Cole Palmer back to the Etihad Stadium this summer, according to reports.",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is set to accept a ‘pay cut’ in order to seal a ‘dream transfer’ this summer, according to reports.",
      "It wouldn’t really make much sense for Chelsea Football Club to sell Cole Palmer at any price. But what about Chelsea the portfolio company?",
      "Brentford have finally signed a Premier League champion. Some clubs’ most recent title winner is obvious but Liverpool and Newcastle are exceptions.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are lining up a €250m world-record offer to sign Chelsea attacker Cole Palmer this summer, according to reports."

      "With an extra £65m in the bank, Brentford are free to go back in for the England U21 star having seen a bid rejected by the Suffolk club last week.",
      "Hutchinson, who joined Ipswich from Chelsea on loan in 2023 before a permanent deal last summer, had a £35m release clause in his contract, but Brentford’s bid failed to offer that amount upfront. That clause has since expired, meaning Ipswich can demand whatever fee they like.",
      "Despite missing out the first time, Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who played for Ipswich in 2011, remains keen on signing the 21-year-old.",
      "According to Football Insider, sources have said Brentford are “expected” to make another approach in the coming days but the fee is likely to be more than the original £35m release clause.",
      "Having played in the U21 Euros this summer, Hutchinson did not travel with Ipswich to Austria for their pre-season training camp but manager Kieran McKenna was asked about the future of the playmaker.",
      "The Northern Irishman said interest was “natural” but Hutchinson is “still an Ipswich Town player.”",
      "“Omari’s having a well-earned holiday,” said McKenna. “There’s obviously been interested parties in Omari, which is natural with what he’s done. But he’s still an Ipswich Town player.",
      "“My full focus really has been on the group that’s here. Hopefully, we’ll catch up with Omari next week.”",
      "Having come through the Arsenal and Chelsea youth academies, Hutchinson joined Ipswich on a loan deal in July 2023 and was a key part of the Tractor Boys’ return to the Premier League.",
      "His performances, which saw him score 10 and assist six in 44 league appearances, prompted Ipswich to sign him for a then-club record fee of £20m.",
      "But Hutchinson, along with the whole of the Ipswich team, struggled back in the top flight and he managed just five goal contributions in 31 league matches as Town were relegated straight back down.",
      "This summer, he played a starring role in England’s retention of the U21 Euros, scoring a goal in the final as the Young Lions defeated Germany 3-2.",

      "Manchester City are prominent in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Cunha and Mbeumo are in but No 1) will never be shifted",
      "",
      "1) Neymar – £200m/€222m (Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2017)\nA fee so ridiculous La Liga refused to receive the payment so PSG said LOL to FFP and handed the money straight to Barcelona, activating one of those stratospheric release clauses designed to typically make such transfers essentially impossible.",
      "",
      "2) Eden Hazard – £143m/€160m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, July 2019)\nThe initial payment of £88.5m alone would have been a disastrous transfer, but Hazard accidentally activated enough variables in between numerous injuries before his retirement to make this an all-time great waste of money.",
      "",
      "3) Philippe Coutinho – £142m/€160m (Liverpool to Barcelona, January 2018)\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint the most damning aspect of this deal from a buyer’s perspective, but it’s somewhere between the £106m initial fee, the £26.4m in clauses paid out for Coutinho’s first 90 appearances, the £89m premium Barcelona reluctantly agreed to pay if they signed any further Liverpool players in the next two years, the fact Coutinho won the Champions League with Bayern Munich while on loan from the Nou Camp, scoring twice in the 8-2 quarter-final humiliation of the Catalans, or the knockdown price of £17m paid by Aston Villa after four underwhelming years.",
      "",
      "4) Ousmane Dembele – £135m/€147m (Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, August 2017)\nWith a bruised ego and the Neymar cash burning a hole in their back pocket, Barcelona had tried all summer to sign Coutinho but after facing resistance from Liverpool, they went cap in hand to Dortmund for their back-up instead. And lessons were learned with a £369.6m release clause inserted this time – not that the Frenchman has ever come close to warranting such lavish interest until he found his ambipedal feet at PSG.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Felix – £113m/€126m (Benfica to Atletico Madrid, July 2019)\nPerhaps the worst match of player and manager there has ever been for a club-record transfer. How strange that the skilful individualist forward who doesn’t track back never meshed with a totalitarian coach who demands suffering and sacrifice from his subordinates. How strange that Atletico committed such sums on a teenager with 45 career first-team appearances. How strange that they couldn’t find anyone to buy him until Chelsea rocked up again.",
      "",
      "6) Antoine Griezmann – £107m/€120m (Atletico Madrid to Barcelona, July 2019)\nAfter The Decision favoured Atletico in 2018, the Frenchman could no longer avoid the Barcelona pull a year later in a sale which enraged Los Rojiblancos, considering a £180m release clause had only expired a couple of weeks before. Griezmann has somehow managed to remain without a La Liga winner’s medal through it all, timing his moves back and forth to Atletico and Barca comedically poorly.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish – £100m/€117.5m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nWhile it looked like an ungainly fit at first, Grealish went an awfully long way towards justifying his astronomical fee as a key part of a Treble-winning, mass-celebrating machine in his second season at the Etihad. Then it all started to fall apart again as he lost his way.",
      "",
      "8) Neymar – £86.3m/€100m (Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal, August 2023)\nThat world-record, market-breaking move to France delivered neither the Ballon d’Or nor the non-Barcelona Champions League that Neymar craved, so the Brazilian decided to cheat by joining the most successful side in AFC Champions League history for loadsa money, loadsa cars, loadsa bedrooms and loadsa saunas. A ruptured knee ligament meant he played seven times in Saudi Arabia before being released by mutual consent.",
      "",
      "9) Gareth Bale – £85.2m/€100m (Tottenham to Real Madrid, September 2013)\nAfter cramming half of his total Premier League goals by that point into a single phenomenal season, Bale became the latest obsession of a Real Madrid side desperate to win La Decima. The Welshman helped deliver that in his first campaign with a decisive goal in the Champions League final – the first of five European Cups and second of 15 trophies for a player the supporters nevertheless came to hate.",
      "",
      "10) Antony – £82m/€95m (Ajax to Man Utd, September 2022)\nErik ten Hag put all his eggs in the Antony basket but a few must have cracked in transit from Amsterdam, the relatively slow and predominantly one-footed winger scoring eight goals and assisting three in a 44-game debut season.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – £73m/€85m (Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd, July 2021)\nIn his three full seasons with Borussia Dortmund, Sancho’s least productive campaign was his first, when he scored 13 goals and provided 20 assists in 43 games. Across an entire Man Utd career which still technically remains a live thing after Chelsea paid £5m to return him rather than £25m to sign him, the forward has scored 12 goals and assisted six in 83 games.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe – £72m/€80m (Lille to Arsenal, August 2019)\nAfter offering the closest challenge to Kylian Mbappe for the Ligue Un Golden Boot, Arsenal spent what was a club-record fee on a player who has popped up around France, Turkey and Spain since being long outgrown by the upwardly mobile Gunners.",
      "",
      "13) Neymar – £71.5m/€86.2m (Santos to Barcelona, June 2013)\nThe financial details are wonderfully murky but official documents submitted to the authority revealed the final fee, as well as a €40m payment to Neymar’s parents.",
      "",
      "14) Kai Havertz – £71m/€80m (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, September 2020)\nExpensive flop who never fit into one defined position and suffered for regular managerial upheaval? Or scorer of the winning goals in the Champions League and Club World Cup finals? A little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "",
      "15) Bryan Mbeumo – £65m/€75m (Brentford to Manchester United, July 2025)\nIt is a quite significant overpay by some market value standards but ultimately Manchester United believe Mbeumo can help sort out a failing attack after scoring 70 goals and assisting 51 in six seasons at Brentford.",
      "",
      "16) Julian Alvarez – £64m/€75.8m (Manchester City to Atletico Madrid, August 2024)\nThe fee could rise to £80m but eyebrows were raised when Manchester City squeezed quite so much out of Atletico, even for a world champion with 54 goal contributions and six trophies in 103 appearances. A 29-goal debut season in Spain made it seem more as though the Premier League side had been fleeced.",
      "",
      "17) James Rodriguez – £63m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nA proper throwback transfer pretty much solely down to Rodriguez starring at the World Cup, the Colombian won a fair few trinkets at the Bernabeu but never came close to settling or justifying that fee.",
      "",
      "18) Matheus Cunha – £62.5m/€74.2m (Wolves to Man Utd, June 2025)\nIn a welcome sign they are returning to a formerly successful transfer policy, Manchester United chucked a whole load of money at a team below them in the Premier League’s bottom half by virtue of goal difference alone.",
      "",
      "19) Kai Havertz – £62m/€71.7m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nMikel Arteta saw enough in those three mixed years at Stamford Bridge to deem Havertz crucial to his Arsenal process. Almost no-one else thought it was a signing worth making but the vision has become clearer over time, particularly so in the German’s injury-enforced absence.",
      "",
      "20) Mykhaylo Mudryk – £62m/€70m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, January 2023)\nThe biggest possible fee is the one most often quoted but Chelsea would be absolutely delighted if they end up paying the full £88.5m/€100m for Mudryk, who is embroiled in a drugs test fiasco.",

      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "26) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",

      "While neither the striker Arsenal need nor the Rodrygo-level wide forward they wanted, Madueke will provide the sort of attacking cover which was painfully lacking in their latest failed title charge.",

      "",
      "23) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long.

      "22) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "21) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",

      "20) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",

      "19) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "18) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "17) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",

Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",

The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",

      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time.

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with Manchester United unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that six of the nine biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for two of the others when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono, while Saudi side Al-Qadsiah apparently went overboard bringing in Mateo Retegui.",
      "But those six Premier League overpays, made by four of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",

      "It is little wonder an ‘angry’ Manchester United ‘slammed’ Brentford once the deal to sign Mbeumo was finally completed 44 days after their opening bid.",
      "That came in at around £45m plus £10m in add-ons, which the Bees were never going to accept but a testing of the waters was entirely necessary.",
      "Once a second offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons was rejected Ruben Amorim’s side had a choice to make: begrudgingly accept that various taxes from a Manchester United one to a general Premier League levy was going to be applied; or walk away from a deal for their priority target who they had already invested a large amount of the transfer window on pursuing.",
      "There was at one stage an insistence that Manchester United would not be held to ransom but they excel at few things more than baulking at a fee while paying it.",
      "This is their new transfer policy and it costs a pretty penny.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m rising to £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",

      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",

      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £48.5m rising to £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United)",

      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",
      "It is unknown precisely how far Manchester United would have gone in the bidding if Cunha wasn’t accompanied by a release clause which specified his price tag – or indeed if they would have targeted him at all without one.",
      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",
      "And if all else fails, Manchester United will simply continue Cunha’s career trend of being sold for £18m profit every two years.",

      "Fee: £55m rising to £60m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "A former Arsenal player has backed Noni Madueke to become a starter, while criticising fan reaction and comparing him to Kai Havertz.",

      "“Well, what I wanted to tell you is that in the last 24 hours, let me say especially in the recent hours, overnight, the night between Monday and Tuesday, intermediaries and agents close to Sporting offered again to Manchester United the opportunity to enter in the deal and try to hijack the move.",
      "“So what they did in this kind of case is to tell Man Utd something like: ‘If you want, Arsenal are offering this, but they’ve not closed the deal yet, so if you want you can still enter, at the original agreement with Sporting’.",
      "“So Man Utd have been offered again the opportunity, as well as Saudi clubs, to hijack the original agreement with Sporting, so this happened once again.",
      "“But it’s also very important to say that in the same moment the message from Viktor Gyokeres and his agent to Arsenal has been very clear: ‘I only want to go to Arsenal’.",
      "“The same message also sent to Sporting because Sporting have informed the player of this opportunity. The message Man Utd and Saudi clubs are also receiving is ‘Arsenal’.",
      "“So let’s see what is going to happen there because Arsenal and Sporting keep negotiating on these famous add-ons, keep negotiating on details of the deal. On Monday around lunchtime afternoon, they had new contacts, trying to advance on the structure of these. So continuing in negotiations, still no breakthrough. So Sporting did this move overnight.”",

      "Manchester United have at long, long last completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and now selling clubs can prepare to put a wedge of United tax on their strikers as the Red Devils signpost their next transfer attack.",
      "Here’s a top ten of strikers linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer, ranked according to how much Ruben Amorim wants them to lead his line next season as we enter the mind of the Portuguese boss.",
      "",
      "10) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nFor us there’s a 50/50 chance of Nkunku being very good for his next club after Chelsea. Those odds dip significantly in favour of him continuing to be a bit pants if that next club is in the Premier League.",
      "We realise this is a hackneyed point, but he doesn’t look like he’s physically up to the rigours of the English top flight and Amorim really needs a striker who’s going to bully defenders rather than shy away from a battle as Nkunku often seems to do. He may have worked in one of the spots set to be occupied by Matheus Cunha or Mbeumo, but not as the focal point.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nWe did our best to get Jackson higher up this list and there are few things we would enjoy more than him proving 99 per cent of punters wrong by thriving as a first-choice striker at a big club.",
      "But having defended him for much of the last two seasons, after the performances of Liam Delap and particularly Joao Pedro at the Club World Cup played a significant part in driving Chelsea to that trophy and in the minds of some makes the Blues contenders of sorts for the coming season, we now accept that the very highest level is likely too high for the Senegal striker.",
      "Chelsea would not be a concern for Liverpool and the other title chasers if Jackson was still the starting No.9.",
      "He would massively improve United, but then yer da would, and Amorim will want a striker for the long-term who has a decent chance of becoming world class if they’re not already, and we’ve probably now seen enough of Jackson to know that’s highly unlikely to happen in his case.",
      "",
      "8) Moise Kean (Fiorentina)\nWhile we’re bang up for United being entirely duped by Kean’s 25-goal season and for him to be as disappointing for them as he was for Everton, we actually think he could be really good.",
      "It seems as though the required click to get him into gear after a string of false starts at some very big football clubs happened last season. His first move to the Premier League just came too early and while we wouldn’t advise him to move to Old Trafford as it’s absolutely not the place to move to after a first truly successful goalscoring season, it feels like a smart move for United to tap into potential that’s only just starting to be realised.",
      "",
      "7) Goncalo Ramos (PSG)\nAmorim would snap your hand off for his PSG goal rate of one every 111 minutes and he’s got the sort of profile he’s after – big, strong, runs in behind, links the play well.",
      "The worry will be whether Ramos is capable of replicating that rate as a starting No.9 and while he got close for Benfica in his last season before moving to the Ligue 1 giants, that’s unlikely to ease concerns as that’s Benfica and this is Manchester United.",
      "But the ship has sailed for anti-Big Five European league banalities, United aren’t about to sign a 24-year-old striker who’s scored 20 goals in the Bundesliga or La Liga, because a) there about three of them, and b) they already play for far superior clubs than Manchester United.",
      "",
      "6) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nWe’re all imagining another Casemiro situation where United chase one of these younger strikers for the next few weeks, turn to Watkins as a safe but calloused pair of ageing hands on deadline day and pay roughly £20m over his valuation to ensure they don’t have Rasmus Hojlund leading the line next season.",
      "We’ll all be told by United-leaning pundits and publications that this is actually exactly what United need as Watkins can lead the line and provide Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee breathing space to develop as backups, only for Watkins’ dramatic decline in the space of a season to necessitate one or other of the alternatives to take the reins and prove beyond doubt what we know already – that they’re not good enough for what Manchester United want to be either.",
      "But – and this is a big BUT – Watkins will almost certainly be pretty good for a while, and Amorim may well be thinking about the short-term in regards to his own future at the club. And if he’s not, he should be.",
      "",
      "5) Samu Aghehowa (Porto)\nHe came very close to moving to Chelsea in a sort of swap deal for Conor Gallagher last summer but backed away from talks over an image rights disagreement, instead moving to Porto from Atlético Madrid before scoring 27 goals for the Portuguese side last term.",
      "Aghehowa may be the biggest risk of any striker on this list but also has arguably the highest ceiling.",
      "",
      "4) Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nMateta is far closer to Watkins than Aghehowa in the you-know-what-you’re-gonna-get stakes. He’s a striker whose Premier League career can be split down the middle – it’s astonishing to think he was lumped in with Odsonne Edouard as a pair of interchangeable Crystal Palace strikers before Oliver Glasner arrived to not only reignite his career but take it to another level.",
      "He’s scored 30 goals in 59 games under Glasner, including 13 against the Big Six plus Newcastle and Aston Villa, and we’re guessing him being so good under one coach compared to others may concern Amorim. But if he’s good enough for Liverpool he’s absolutely good enough for United.",
      "",
      "3) Randal Kolo Muani (PSG)\nWe’re guessing most of you wonderful F365 readers are similar to us in that your opinions on Kolo Muani are largely based on his displays for France, particularly him coming on in the World Cup final to entirely change the game against Argentina, in which case you would see this as quite the coup for Manchester United.",
      "He earned a move to PSG on the back of that tournament but barely played, making his six-month loan at Juventus arguably a better barometer for success at Old Trafford along with those displays for his national team. He scored ten goals for the Old Lady, who would be signing him permanently if they had the cash.",
      "",
      "2) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nA striker signing for a Big Six club without European football hasn’t gone well historically, but that’s more something for Sesko to think about than Manchester United, who could provide us with the dream scenario of Arsenal’s top target banging in goals at Old Trafford while the Red Devils’ preferred option flops at the Emirates.",
      "",
      "1) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting)\nWe’ve been treated to some intermediary sh*thousery in the last couple of days, with several Portuguese outlets informed of United coming back in for Gyokeres, which appears to be news to United, Gyokeres, Sporting and anyone else involved in his future, just to give Arsenal the willies.",
      "Like the lead in a coming-of-age high school drama imploring a love interest to ‘want me for being me’, Amorim said back in April that he would only want to sign Gyokeres if he wanted to join Manchester United for Manchester United, independent of Champions League football.",
      "Our guess is that Amorim would actually welcome a kicking and screaming Gyokeres through the Old Trafford doors in the knowledge that the Sweden international is absolutely ideal for his 3-4-3 system having thrived under him at Sporting, and Gyokeres would surely have to put a brave face on things anyway and insist that his father save further tears over a failed Arsenal move for private settings.",
      "Arsenal are yet to reach an agreement with Sporting CP for Viktor Gyokeres despite Fabrizio Romano’s claims on Tuesday, according to reports.",

      "Amid reports claiming Sir Jim Ratcliffe would not be ‘held to ransom’ as Brentford held out for their asking price, Mirror have revealed that Manchester United are ‘angry’ with Mbeumo’s now former club in a ‘slam’ of their transfer tactics.",
      "It’s claimed Brentford ‘put pressure on the forward to go to Newcastle or Tottenham’ over United despite the 25-year-old insisting he only had eyes for a move to Old Trafford, while putting further ‘pressure on Mbeumo to reduce his wage demands’ in order to ‘increase the size of fee they would receive’.",
      "The report adds:",

      "And The Daily Mail claim the Red Devils saw a bid for Villa’s Martinez – whom Amorim ‘had set his sights on to provide the third leg of his summer rebuild’ – rejected over the weekend.",
      "The report claims that United’s loan proposal for the 32-year-old was ‘put to Villa officials but was met with incredulity and rebuffed immediately’.",

      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal – £123.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",

      "Marcus Rashford has completed a medical at Barcelona ahead of a proposed season-long loan move with an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:36, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams then Liverpool's Luis Diaz but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so do his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",

      "Report as Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against Leeds; Matheus Cunha made his debut but United failed to show much attacking improvement; Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar, but Leeds had good chances through Largie Ramazani",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on his way to complete a £71m move to Manchester, but there is still a lot left to be desired about Amorim's attack on the basis of this showing.",

      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",
      "On Diego Leon's debut at left wing-back: \"We have to understand that the kid came from Paraguay. It's his second week at Manchester United. He did really well, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.",
      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody [on the United States tour] - not just between the players butthe staff. All the changes are stopping. We need to leave that as a group.",
      "\"We have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. We need to improve.\"",
      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",
      "There's now less than a month to go until United's Premier League opener with Arsenal. An awful lot still needs to change on the pitch if Amorim's project is going to take off.",
