      "Manchester United’s failure to sign their 'top target' Florian Wirtz is set to come back to haunt them as Liverpool close in on the German sensation. Liverpool are currently in talks with Bayer Leverkusen after convincing Wirtz and his representatives that his future lies in Merseyside.",
      "The 22-year-old's family recently flew to Liverpool to look at houses in the north west of England, having been impressed with Arne Slot’s vision for him and the Premier League winners going forward.",
      "The Reds have since submitted an opening bid of £85million plus add-ons for the Germany international after receiving the green light from owners Fenway Sports Group. That sum falls short of Leverkusen’s valuation of the player, with the German side understood to be holding out for a deal that would break the Premier League transfer record, set by Chelsea’s £115m move for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "Yet, Wirtz’s preference to join Liverpool over Bayern Munich means the Premier League champions are very much the frontrunners in the race to secure their long-term target’s signature, with negotiations between the two clubs continuing and an agreement likely very soon.",
      "Suchnews will be particularly poorly received in certain Manchester circles after they passed up the opportunity to sign him three-and-a-half years ago.",
      "During Ralf Rangnick’s brief spell in charge at Old Trafford, the then-interim manager compiled a lengthy list of his top transfer targets for the United hierarchy to bring in.",
      "Rangnick was appointed in December 2021 and was expected to start a two-year consultancy gig once a permanent successor was identified at the end of the season. Ahead of his first transfer window at the helm in January 2022, his wishlist included the likes of Josko Gvardiol, Christopher Nkunku and Erling Haaland.",
      "But an 18-year-old Wirtz was the German’s priority target. Wirtz at the time was enjoying a meteoric rise at Leverkusen, becoming the club’s youngest ever player in the Bundesliga with his debut coming shortly after his 17th birthday in March 2020. With eight goals and eight assists the following season, he earned a call-up to the senior Germany squad in March 2021.",
      "Rangnick had hoped the draw of the Premier League and Old Trafford could persuade Wirtz to join United. The report claimed a transfer fee of £60m would have been sufficient to convince Leverkusen to part ways.",
      "United, however, opted against making any signings in January 2022, much to the frustration of Rangnick. And the interim boss left the club in May after winning just 11 of his 31 games, ending the Red Devils’ pursuit of Wirtz.",
      "Since then, the attacking-midfielder has gone on to become one of European football’s brightest talents thanks to his performances under Xabi Alonso. He played a pivotal role as Leverkusen completed an unbeaten domestic double last season, which put him on the radar of clubs like Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Chelsea.",
      "Newly-crowned German champions Bayern were quietly confident that they could complete a deal this summer for Wirtz, who is under contract with Leverkusen until 2027. However, that fell apart after Wirtz and his parents – who represent him in negotiations – met with Bayern chief Max Eberl, club supremo Uli Hoeness and head coach Vincent Kompany.",
      "It is understood that they left the meeting feeling underwhelmed and with a lack of clarity around Bayern's plans for him. The opposite happened when they met with Liverpool, who impressed due to a depth of knowledge around Wirtz, allowing them to push ahead in the queue.",
      "Leverkusen’s managing director Simon Rolfes this week confirmed that Liverpool hold “concrete interest” in him. \"[Wirtz is] one of our players,\" Rolfes said at the press conference to unveil new head coach Erik ten Hag on Monday. \"Naturally, there’s a lot of interest. There’s concrete interest from Liverpool but there’s no more to say right now. Florian is our player.”",
      "The blockbuster deal for Wirtz is just one part of Liverpool’s plans for the summer transfer window, with his Leverkusen team-mate Jeremie Frimpong also heading for Anfield in a £29.5m deal, while Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez is also of interest. Their potential arrivals is clear evidence of the pulling power of winning, with Slot able to convince players following his Premier League title victory.",
      "On the plus side for United and Ruben Amorim, they are edging close to completing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, with a medical on the way for the Brazilian attacker.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Alejandro Garnacho needs to stop moaning about his situation at Manchester United and go elsewhere to prove their struggles are not down to him. That’s the opinion of former United midfielder Gordon Strachan, who has urged the club to sell Garnacho at the earliest opportunity in the summer transfer window.",
      "Garnacho is an unwilling participant on United’s post-season tour to Malaysia and Hong Kong and is desperate to leave the club following a miserable end to the season. United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham and will undergo a major squad overhaul in the coming months.",
      "Garnacho admitted the season had been “s***” and hinted at a summer departure after the loss in Bilbao. He attracted interest from Chelsea and Napoli in January and the Italian club are expected to open talks with United over a transfer soon.",
      "That would be a good move for all parties involved, according to ex-manager Strachan, who slammed Garnacho’s attitude. \"Garnacho's got to go. I think he shows a lack of maturity and needs a real wake-up call. Manchester United is far too good of a club to listen to him whingeing and whining all the time,” he told Esports Insider.",
      "\"You wonder what the players at Manchester United are thinking about Alejandro Garnacho’s actions. He should be looking after his team-mates after they lost the Europa League final, not promoting himself with his comments.",
      "\"If he doesn’t want to be a team player then I think it’s best he just goes somewhere else. If the manager decides he's not picking you, you've got to think of the reason, and quite often that starts by looking at yourself.",
      "\"In life the best thing to do when something isn't going your way, or you have issues, is to look at yourself and think whether it stems from you. It's rare that players take that stance anymore, and look at themselves before whining about their problems.\"",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna will reportedly meet United officials in the coming weeks to begin the negotiation process over Garnacho. The Italian champions saw a £40million bid rejected in January and have been told that United value the Argentina international at closer to £70m.",
      "The club are hoping to net a decent transfer fee, given the 20-year-old is under contract until June 2028 and he contributed 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The 22-year-old striker scored 12 goals in the Premier League for Ipswich this season and their relegation to the Championship has opened the door for a move. He has attracted plenty of interest, with David Moyes admitting last week that Delap had “spoken to three or four clubs”, including Everton.",
      "United had previously been confident of landing the England under-21 international, but it seems that recent events have tipped the balance. Ruben Amorim’s side finished a dismal 15th in the Premier League and won’t play any form of European football next season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "By contrast, Chelsea ended the season in style, securing a place in the Champions League by finishing in fourth place before winning the Conference League by beating Real Betis in Wednesday’s final. They also have personal connections to Delap, thanks to Enzo Maresca and recruitment director Joe Shields.",
      "Maresca coached Delap during his time in Manchester City's academy, while Shields played a role in sealing Delap's move from Derby to join City's academy in 2019. That has led to Delap giving the Blues a green light over the deal.",
      "Delap is understood to want to get things wrapped up before playing for England under-21s at this summer’s European Championship. The young Lions get their campaign under way with a match against Czechia on June 12 and, with Chelsea willing to pay his £30m release clause, it seems a deal could be done quickly.",

      "Manchester United have a huge summer ahead of them after what has been a tragic season. The Red Devils finished a lowly 15th in the Premier League having lost 18 games throughout the campaign.",
      "They also failed to seal an unlikely return to the Champions League as they lost out to Tottenham in the Europa League final earlier this month. That looked set to be a huge blow to United’s hopes of a huge rebuild this summer.",
      "But that might be slightly premature, with club chiefs already putting lofty plans in place for the upcoming summer transfer window. United could choose to spend heavily to bolster their side over the coming months, with a series of lucrative signings potentially in the pipeline.",
      "So, what could Ruben Amorim’s side look like on the first day of next season?",
      "Starting in goal, there’s a debate over the future of Andre Onana. The Cameroon goalkeeper has been blighted by a series of errors since his big-money arrival from Inter Milan. And United could look to move him on amid interest from Saudi and raid relegated Leicester for Mads Hermansen. The Dane has shone during the past two seasons in the Midlands and could potentially be available for around £35m.",
      "Moving into defence, the Red Devils look pretty well set. They spent huge fees on Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt last summer and the pair look set to be a key part of the defence.",
      "The same could also be said of Lisandro Martinez, who looks likely to recover from the serious knee injury he picked up earlier this season. Patrick Dorgu should also remain in the side despite a slow start to life at Old Trafford. A number of defenders could consequently leave the club including Tyrell Malacia, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof - the latter two having already confirmed their departures.",
      "Midfield could however look very different come next season. Atalanta midfielder Ederson has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, with Liverpool among those interested. United could muscle in on their rivals’ interest but it won’t be cheap with the Serie A side having put a £63m price tag on the Brazilian. Manuel Ugarte looks set to be a key player under Ruben Amorim - particularly in games where that greater level of midfield graft, rather than craft, is required, after acclimatising to life in the Premier League.",
      "Who should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below",
      "But question marks remain over Casemiro, despite his impressive displays towards the end of the season. Regarding other midfield exits, Christian Eriksen has already departed, while the future of Kobbie Mainoo remains up in the air. Bruno Fernandes could also be among those to leave - albeit Amorim and United chiefs will be desperate to keep the Portuguese playmaker amid serious interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "United’s season this term really stumbled due to their lack of goal threat and that could see the club completely transform their frontline. On-loan stars Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could all be sold permanently.",
      "They could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in leaving. The first attacking signing of the new era looks set to be Wolves star Matheus Cunha, who will likely put pen to paper at Old Trafford after United activated a £62.5m release clause in his deal.",
      "He could also be joined by fellow Premier League star Bryan Mbeumo. Reports have suggested that the Red Devils have opened talks for a £50m deal for the 20-goal forward but they could face competition from Newcastle.",
      "Finally, a new central striker could be on the agenda for United. Liam Delap is among the targets, albeit Chelsea look to be moving ahead in the race for the Ipswich star.",
      "That could potentially see United move their crosshairs to Victor Osimhen, who has spent the past season with Turkish side Galatasaray. And he could be available for as little as £51m this summer. He would be the ideal replacement to solve the club’s goalscoring issue following another brilliant campaign.",
      "Potential Man United XI: Hermansen; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Dalot, Ederson, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",

A man worth $16.7bn (£12.4bn), according to Forbes, making hundreds of staff redundant and sending his exhausted players halfway across the world to appease sponsors and spread the good word of United.",
      "That £7.8m is suddenly looking like a bad deal. The malaise that engulfed the club this season became even darker and thicker with the 1-0 defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final and has now become a pervasive presence; an unwanted 12th man on the pitch.",

      "Many of the 84,000 people who turned up in the Malaysian capital, some of whom had paid £260 for a ticket, booed them off the pitch. In a season of crushing lows, United had somehow managed to plumb new depths. This was embarrassing – and it is obvious who was to blame.",
      "United have set their players up for failure with this ridiculous money-grabbing PR disaster. Even if they had enjoyed a good domestic campaign, or if they had beaten Spurs in Bilbao, the players would not have been up for this trip. There is a reason this is the first time United have embarked on a post-season tour.",
      "This one is only a few days old and it is already backfiring in potentially spectacular fashion. While Matheus Cunha is too far down the line to change his mind over a £62.5m transfer from Wolves to United, other targets are not. United better hope they are enjoying their holiday so much that they haven’t bothered opening social media or reading the newspapers.",
      "Because does anyone really want to join this mess? They are a rubbish football team right now, but more than that, they are a miserable and disunited bunch. They will become a revolving door this summer, shipping out scores of players while scrabbling around for anyone who will join them. They won’t play any European football next season and Carrington is reportedly a vibe vacuum, having had the life sucked out of it by Ratcliffe’s staff purge.",
      "This is the context which players like Liam Delap must currently be assessing. Delap is poised to leave Ipswich for £30m this summer. He is understood to be choosing between United and Chelsea – a decision which currently looks extremely straightforward.",
      "While United ended the season as a representation of the “This is fine” meme, everything burning around them, Chelsea did so with a European trophy and a place in next season’s Champions League secured.",

But what he seems to fail to understand is that perception matters. Yes, he may have succeeded in putting the club on a more even footing financially, but at what cost?",
      "This ludicrous post-season tour is a perfect example of the Ratcliffe era so far: commercially astute yet visually unappealing. It could be extremely damaging to the planned squad overhaul this summer.",

      "\"He works hard but he’s also creative. He gives the opponents a headache to try to solve the problems he poses. He can be decisive and he can cut it in the Premier League. He’s already shown that he’s good enough. Not only that, I think he can handle the pressure, and he is versatile enough to play in midfield or across the front line.\"",
      "Saha has hinted that Cunha could come in and replace Mason Mount, who has struggled for form and fitness throughout his time in Manchester. The ex-Chelsea man joined for a hefty fee but has been unable to have the desired impact and could lose out.",
      "\"That’s the kind of player that United need,\" said Saha. \"When you look at Mason Mount, who has been unlucky with injury, but he doesn’t exploit the space like Cunha does. Mount finds space, but he’s not dangerous in the pockets when he finds them. It’s disappointing from such a big signing.\"",
      "United are set for an overhaul after a dire season. They're without Europe next year but have acted quick in the market and, alongside Cunha, are making moves to land Liam Delap from Ipswich amid competition from Chelsea.",

      "Worries over Alejandro Garnacho's attitude could land him a spot on the Manchester United departures list this summer. And one former Carrington coach appeared to hint at the South American's penchant for petulance years ago.",
      "Murmurs have been building that Ruben Amorim is ready to sell Garnacho, who was dropped for United's final game of the season against Aston Villa. The Daily Mail reported that on the eve of that fixture, Amorim hung the 20-year-old out to dry in front of his team-mates and told him: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\"",
      "Justin Cochrane was part of the academy setup when Garnacho helped guide United's under-18s to the FA Youth Cup crown in 2022. The Argentina international was named Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year in the same season, but his temperament perhaps didn't always match his on-field performance.",
      "Cochrane, who has since moved to become first-team coach at Brentford, stopped short of hanging his former protege out to dry. But even on the path to success three years ago, there were comments pointing to potential flaws in a then-17-year-old Garnacho's character.",
      "Speaking to Goal in March 2022 about keeping the clearly talented winger grounded, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender paralleled that comment by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. But even then, talk diverted to ensuring the player's ego remained grounded, something one might not hear unless there were already concerns in that area.",
      "\"My job and the staff’s job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" added Cochrane. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that’s what we’re focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United boss to take issue with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously reprimanded by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts critical of his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth last April.",
      "Ten Hag later said his player had apologised over the incident, suggesting they had moved on from the ordeal. However, Garnacho was later dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, not long before he was fired, for once again liking posts critical of Ten Hag.",
      "Given Cochrane's comments from 2022, it points to a pattern of behaviour most coaches would rather do without. And it appears Amorim has had the last straw, with the player seemingly free to leave if a suitable offer comes in.",
      "Napoli have been strongly linked with the player in recent transfer windows. However, that move could be in jeopardy amid reports Antonio Conte is prepared to leave the club after just one season, in which he secured the Serie A crown.",
      "That could leave the Red Devils scrambling to find a suitor for the player willing to meet their valuation. And that list could only grow shorter if teams looking to invest are at all unsettled when it comes to Garnacho's personality."

      "Their Manchester United loanee had been crucial in them getting to the final, scoring a stunning goal to see off Fiorentina en route. That is one of several contributions he's made in the final third as the Brazilian continues to rediscover his best form.",
      "It has been a far cry from the Antony we've seen in Manchester with the ex-Ajax man continuing to underwhelm as he fails to deliver on his mammoth price tag. Since moving to Betis though he's been one of La Liga's most productive players.",
      "He endured an off-night in the final however and ex-Blue Frank Leboeuf claims Antony looked more like the player we've seen in Manchester for the last two years.",
      "Leboeuf told ESPN: \"It wasn’t his night. I don’t really follow La Liga except the big games but I thought Antony had a better change in his football. Today I saw the ghost that was playing for Manchester United. The only thing he did was pick fights with Enzo Fernandez.",

      "In light of his impressive form in Spain the United boss has been quizzed on the player's future. Amorim claimed it was only a good thing that Antony had gone on to thrive. \"We see our players doing well on loan in a different context. That can happen and it's a good sign for the club,\" he said.",
      "Antony's future in Manchester remains in doubt but his exploits with Betis have put him firmly in the shop window. The player himself said: \"My work is playing and I'm doing that well. I have a lot of affection for Betis, for everyone but I have a contract with Man United and I don't know what's going to happen.\"",

      "The race is on and instead of taking the steady approach of a marathoner, several of the Premier League’s giants are out of the blocks like sprinters.",
      "It was not until the third week of last summer’s transfer window that the traditional big six completed a signing - with Tosin Adarabioyo joining Chelsea as a free agent and Lucas Bergvall arriving at Tottenham from Djurgarden on July 1.",
      "But already this summer - despite the window not opening until Sunday - Manchester United have made their £62.5m move for Matheus Cunha, Liverpool have done a deal for Jeremie Frimpong with Florian Wirtz possibly following along the path from Leverkusen, and Arsenal are putting the wheels in motion to add the striker they so desperately need.",
      "The calendar is undoubtedly a factor behind this active start. Last summer’s window began the same time as the Euros, this year’s starts early and pauses briefly to factor in Chelsea and Manchester City’s participation in the Club World Cup.",
      "But it is hard to ignore the two other major circumstances prompting this early rush into action.",
      "Top of the list is the chase for goalscorers. The absence of a prolific No9 was the main reason behind Arsenal being unable to prolong their title challenge. A centre-forward capable of finding the net would have eased the crisis at United. Chelsea’s biggest weakness is the absence of a ruthless finisher. And even Liverpool have rued Darwin Nunez’s misfiring.",
      "They are all fighting for a dwindling number of strikers, which is why Liam Delap is commanding such interest after one good season for a team that won just four games all season. Chelsea are keen, so too United, and the Ipswich player’s representatives have already been holding talks with a number of clubs, pointing to a speedy resolution.",
      "Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres, meanwhile, looks destined for north London as Mikel Arteta hopes to add the final piece after the Gunners’ rate of improvement slowed to incremental. That is another transfer that is expected to be completed early in the window - with the Arsenal hierarchy no doubt wary of losing out on their top target. They are also expected to announce the signing of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad early on.",
      "Yet it is not all about the supply and demand of strikers. By ending Manchester City’s era of dominance, Liverpool have opened up a window for their rivals to win a title. This time last year most clubs will have been dreaming but not necessarily believing that they could unseat Pep Guardiola’s side.",
      "Now they are all certain they can do what Arne Slot’s side managed – if they can get the recruitment right. That is why this window could have long-term repercussions, why the gap between success and failure is so thin and we could look back on 2025 a few seasons from now as a period that defined an era.",
      "And that is before considering the long-held fact that the ability to have new acquisitions report for duty at the beginning of pre-season rather than arriving a couple of games into the campaign is rather valuable. Just do not expect a hectic deadline day if the business is completed early."

Barca are understood to prefer the signing of Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, but Rashford could be a more realistic option, given United want to sell and Liverpool don’t.",
      "\"We like Luis, we like Rashford, and we like other players,\" Deco told Catalan radio station RAC 1 recently. \"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",
      "Diaz’s father has previously said it would be a “dream” for his son to join Barca, although the winger has a contract until June 2027 and he recently reaffirmed his happiness on Merseyside after winning the Premier League.",
      "Barcelona will be guided by their financial issues this summer and will likely push for a loan move for Rashford, which could mean a prolonged bargaining period between the two clubs. The Catalan giants have prioritised signing their key players up to new contracts and star wingers Lamine Yamal and Raphinha have already committed their futures to the club following their La Liga win.",
      "\"If we can keep the core of the team together, that's what we want,\" Deco explained. \"I think we can do it. I think you can always improve the team, but you have to understand what kind of player you need. We've focused first on what we have at home and renewals.",
      "\"The renewals of Raphinha, [Frenkie] De Jong, and Eric [Garcia] will come, for sure. That's the priority. We'll talk about improving the team if we can, but the key is stability. We don't believe that players will ask to leave.\"",

      "Real Betis star Antony had pain written across his face after Chelsea beat the Spanish side to win the Conference League. The Manchester United flop has thrived during his loan spell in Seville, but couldn't cap the season with a trophy.",
      "Chelsea did things the hard way in the final in Wroclaw. Ez Abde gave Betis a half-time advantage, only for Cole Palmer to lead the comeback with a pair of assists after the hour mark.",
      "Palmer set up Enzo Fernandez and Nicolas Jackson to turn the game on its head. There was time for more, though, with Jadon Sancho combining with fellow substitute Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for a third and Moises Caicedo adding some stoppage-time gloss to the scoreline,",
      "After the final whistle, Antony could be seen hunched over, appearing to be gathering his thoughts. In one photo, Chelsea stars Levi Colwill and Romeo Lavia can be seen looking towards the Brazilian, who was seen in tears after Betis' defeat.",
      "It was a better story for his fellow United outcast Sancho, though. The former Borussia Dortmund star joined Chelsea on loan from United at the end of the summer window, and ends the campaign with a European trophy while his parent club miss out after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Antony might have struggled at Old Trafford, but he rediscovered his form with Betis. He has nine goals and five assists across 26 games for the club - having only managed 12 goals and five assists in his 96 United outings.",
      "Both Antony and Sancho now face uncertain futures. Chelsea and United included an obligation to buy in their loan - though the Blues can still get out of it - while Antony's future may depend on whether Betis or any other club can meet the Red Devils' asking price.",
      "\"Watching from the bench you can see where the spaces are and how you can help the team. When I came on for Benny [Badiashile] I could see he was working so hard and then the gaps were open. He did that for me, laid the foundations for me.\"",

      "Kirsten Heukels, the body language consultant hired by Manchester United on a £175,000-per-year salary, has defended her role at the club amid criticism from part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Heukels joined the club during Erik ten Hag's time as manager, but was pointed to by Ratcliffe in a discussion of how the club was haemhorraging money when he arrived.",
      "One of Heukels' roles was to help United's players with penalty shoot-outs. Her background was outside football, but during her time the club secured vital shoot-out victories over Brighton and Coventry in successive FA Cup campaigns.",
      "She spoke with United's keepers during her time at Old Trafford, and also met outfield players. However, speaking to The Athletic, she claims there was no direct contact with anyone at owners INEOS.",
      "“I don’t look at life this way,” Heukels said when asked about Ratcliffe's comments. “I believe it was a courageous thing that the team did back then. And I’m proud of what we achieved.",
      "\"The achievements are in the data, so they are proven. I don’t need to explain that to anybody,\" she continued. \"I don’t know enough about him or United today because I’m not involved, but it’s always dangerous to talk about your predecessors this way.”",
      "It was back in March that Ratcliffe referenced Heukels' role and salary - albeit not her name - in an interview with The Times. In the same piece, the billionaire opened up on the financial situation affecting the club since his arrival.",
      "“If you think of it in really simple terms, you’ve got the operating costs, which are all the staff and the fixed costs of running the business,\" he said. \"And then you’ve got all the squad costs, player salaries and player purchases.",
      "“In super simple terms, the club has been spending more money than it’s been earning now for the last seven years, and it ends in a very difficult place. And for Manchester United, that place ended at the end of this year, the end of 2025, with the club running out of cash. I think it’s the first time we’ve probably said that in public, but that’s the fact of the matter.”",
      "Heukels, who also credits former United coach Steve McClaren among others for helping her during her time at Old Trafford, predominantly scouted opposition penalty takers. The 2023 Brighton shoot-out win was described as a breakthrough, while she was also in her role when David de Gea made his first Old Trafford penalty save in nine years during a match against Fulham shortly after.",
      "“I look at how they are walking up to the spot,” Heukels explains. “How their face is holding itself, because you can think you’re looking cool but your face will tell me more and you will leak it all. I will look at body language and their interaction with the goalkeeper — whether they are looking at him or not.”",

      "For the second Wednesday running, Manchester United had to traipse past dignitaries to collect their silver medals.",
      "The Maybank Challenge Cup was not exactly coveted. It was on the table in a room adjacent to the press conference room. Three of us requested a picture with it, so a few from Manchester managed to get their hands on the trophy.",
      "Some United players tried to make a quick getaway after full-time. Dave Harrison, the director of football operations who finds himself chaperoning United players around stadiums, reminded them to observe the post-match procession.",
      "After United collected their medals, Casemiro, Alejandro Garnacho, Harry Amass and Toby Collyer again tried to make their exit. But no, they were ushered back onto the pitch to observe the trophy lift by the ASEAN All Stars.",
      "Incongruously, the 1997 non-classic Sing Up For The Champions, an official single released by United when they actually were champions, was played as United collected their medals. The lyrics refer to winning the Football League again in Merseyside and namecheck Ryan Giggs, Gary Pallister, Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy Keane.",
      "Amorim clasped hands and received a warm embrace from the United chief executive Omar Berrada when he collected his medal. He removed it immediately.",
      "\"My biggest concern is that we need to have the feeling that we need to win every game,\" Ruben Amorim said, \"even a small-sided game on the street, that kind of feeling every game, every exercise that is what we have to do to push the players.\"",
      "Nobody feels sorry for the United players after the season they have subjected their supporters to. Whether these players stay or go, the humiliation of losing a final to Tottenham and then to fire blanks again in Malaysia a week later is form that warrants boos.",
      "The last time United were booed on domestic soil was at half-time against Leicester City in the FA Cup fourth round back in February. Leicester somehow lost to United four times in 2024-25 but they threatened a shock that night until Harry Maguire made the most of a linesman's myopia.",
      "Since then, United matchgoers have sworn by harmonious atmospheres. Their end in the San Mames Stadium emptied quicker than a bathtub of water, which was their form of expressing disapproval. United fans are very dignified like that.",
      "Four days later against Aston Villa, there was no pre-match rancour and 'We'll never die' got an early and defiant airing. United also played well and won.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, they were back on unwatchable form. Collyer was booed for playing the ball into touch with United 1-0 down. At full-time, there was more booing.",
      "Amorim understood it. \"I feel always guilty of the performance of the team since I am here in the first game,\" he admitted. \"I am guilty then the boos from the fans, maybe it is something we need because every game that we lost in the Premier League, they were always there. I felt when we finished every time the supporters were with us. Let's see for next season.\"",
      "There were 27 substitutions by Amorim alone. In an occasion that was as far removed from a competitive match as possible - a light show, a Mexican wave, innumerable substitutions - Rasmus Hojlund was still isolated, detached and sloppy.",
      "Hojlund left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium in a cheerful mood, cracking a brief joke with a United press officer. At Amorim's press conference, Hojlund was described as \"a shadow of himself\" and \"hesitant\" by a local reporter.",
      "Maybe Hojlund has seen the writing on the wall. United are waiting on a decision from Liam Delap, only four days younger than Hojlund. Delap would cost half the price, too. But if Delap returns to Manchester it will be to replace Hojlund.",
      "\"Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations,\" Amorim said in response to the query about Hojlund. \"Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season. Even the environment in the training ground can help all these players have more confidence.",
      "\"If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals. We will try to assess that and be prepared.\"",
      "Amorim was already on the United coach when Garnacho strode out, sunglasses on, scanning his phone. Garnacho completely blanked those assembled in the mixed zone, which had descended more into a meet-and-greet pen.",
      "Amorim usually sits in the front row of the coach, so Garnacho will have had to have walked past him. Wearing sunglasses more befitting a superhero with midnight looming in Kuala Lumpur suggested he was trying to make a point.",
      "There is no power struggle between manager and player. It is a non-contest as United have backed Amorim after he told Garnacho that he can leave.",
      "Garnacho did, however, generate genuine adoration from the crowd, along with Bruno Fernandes, the renascent Harry Maguire and, somewhat peculiarly, Andre Onana. Onana, Maguire and Diogo Dalot are now bound for a commercial trek to India while their teammates head on to Hong Kong.",
      "Fernandes was the last to leave and he generously signed some shirts and stopped for pictures. United were in no rush. They were staying in the city another night after defeat.",
      "Just like they did last week."

      "Marcus Rashford is reportedly holding out for a move to Barcelona and is saying no to other moves, according to SPORT in Spain.",
      "The publicatin states that the forward's agent held talks with Barca sporting director Deco in a Spanish hotel on Wednesday morning. It's said that Hansi Flick and the sporting management are 'seduced' by the player's motivation to join them.",

      "AC Milan are set to open negotiations for Alejandro Garnacho after he was made available for transfer this summer.",

      "After the developments that Chelsea had become favourites to sign Liam Delap, it now seems that the Conference League winners are looking elsewhere.",

      "The season has finished and Manchester United are still finding a way to lose football matches.",
      "United faced ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur in front of 72,000 supporters and they suffered a 1-0 defeat after a second half goal from Maung Maung Lwin.",
      "Maung Maung Lwin is not a household name, but he might become famous in Malaysia after taking the scalp of United. The result of the post-season friendly does not matter, although there were a few interesting aspects of the contest, including the involvement of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Ruben Amorim made wholesale changes at the interval and Garnacho was introduced, despite having been told before the final day of the season he could find a new club this summer.",
      "Amorim was asked if Garnacho had played his final game for the club after the win over Aston Villa and said: \"Garnacho is one more player of Manchester United, so I don't know what is going to happen in the future. He is a normal player.\"",
      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Speaking before the Aston Villa match, Amorim confirmed that Garnacho would still travel on the post-season tour. It's possible that the only reason Garnacho has been included on the trip is to protect his transfer value.",
      "Garnacho was omitted from the squad on the final day of the campaign, but he was still given minutes against ASEAN All-Stars, which suggests to the outside world that it's business as usual.",
      "The reality is the relationship between Garnacho and Amorim seems to have broken down, and if that is the case, it damages United's power in negotiations in the summer window.",
      "Garnacho could potentially fetch a transfer fee of £70million, but suitors will submit lower offers if they know United want to sell the winger because Amorim wants him out of the door.",
      "That means including Garnacho on the post-season tour and giving him minutes is perhaps a clever ploy to protect his value. Interested clubs, like Napoli and Chelsea, will probably see right through the tactic, but it's better to have Garnacho involved with the first team than frozen out.",
      "It's obviously difficult to sell a player for their market value when a public decision has already been communicated, so Amorim must do what he can to protect his bargaining power.",
      "Garnacho was pictured with a huge smile when the post-season team photo was taken at Manchester Airport, but he didn't look quite so cheery during exchanges with Malaysian fans the day before facing ASEAN All-Stars - it must be added that a long-distance flight and more games after a draining season are enough to leave any player feeling glum.",
      "It's a shame to see Garnacho's time at Old Trafford end on a sour note, if indeed he does leave this summer, but he has crossed managers on too many occasions. Amorim has reiterated he is still a United player, which seems in name only.",
      "Garnacho's last game for United looks set to be on tour in Hong Kong this week."

      "It promises to be a busy summer for Manchester United and while they may not have the riches Champions League football brings to add to their kitty, a whole host of expected outgoings this summer means there should be money to spend.",
      "The club are likely to complete the singing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5m deal. United need to address their goalscoring problems and so changes to the frontline will be key, but midfield is also a department in need of attention.",
      "We've taken a look at how United's dream midfield could look after a dream transfer window. For the purposes of this exercise, we have classed wing-backs as part of the midfield set-up.",
      "Ruben Amorim's need for athletic and pacey wing-backs saw him turn to Amad early on in his United tenure, though the Ivory Coast star has tended to be used as one of the two No.10s. Patrick Dorgu has struggled to really give United the attacking threat they need from the left wing and so Amorim could move Amad back to right wing-back to ensure United carry a threat on one of the flanks.",
      "Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui could both fill in at wing-back but neither should be considered a viable option. Both are far better suited to a place in the back three and so they should not form part of United's best wing-back options.",
      "Harry Amass has settled into the first team set-up well and can provide adequate cover for Dorgu, perhaps even pushing him for a start. With Diogo Dalot another option, United should be well-stocked in the wing-back roles. Tyrell Malacia definitely needs to be sold.",
      "If Amad is moved back into the right wing-back role and United complete the sales they are looking to make this summer, Amorim may opt to use Bruno Fernandes as one of the two No.10s rather than as a central midfielder - even if Matheus Cunha arrives - and so at least one midfielder needs to be brought in.",
      "Atalanta ace Ederson is attracting attention from across Europe and his style of play would make him a perfect fit for Amorim's system. He is said to be available for £65million and would be a real statement signing given the calibre of clubs monitoring the Brazilian.",
      "Ederson could start alongside Manuel Ugarte and there's a hope that Kobbie Mainoo can maintain fitness and make himself part of that conversation next season. There's a chance United could cash-in on Mainoo but his talent is clear and they should be doing all they can to keep hold of him.",
      "United can't be deceived by Casemiro's heroics en route to the Europa League final. The Brazilian midfielder needs to be moved on this summer. That would still leave United with two options in every position across the midfield, with the adaptability of the likes of Fernandes meaning they would still have cover if multiple players were unavailable.",
      "Wing-back options: Amad, Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Harry Amass.",
      "Central-midfield options: Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Ederson, Collyer."

      "Biancheri recently teamed up with the Canada senior squad for the first time after being left out of the Wales squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Belgium.",
      "The striker, 18, qualifies to play for Italy and Canada, the birth of places of his parents, and Wales at international level, meaning he is not short on options.",
      "He recently accepted an invitation to link up with Marsch's squad as they prepare for their upcoming friendlies against Ukraine and the Ivory Coast at the start of next month.",
      "And despite still not making his first-team debut for United or one of the three countries he qualifies to represent, he has been compared to one of the world's current most sought-after strikers in David, who will be a free agent this summer after making the decision to leave French club Lille after five seasons at the club.",
      "\"He's a dynamic player,\" Marsch said of Biancheri, who starred for United's Under-18s and Under-21s this season. \"He's very good around the goal.",
      "\"You can see he's an intelligent player. He's a version of Jonathan David.",
      "\"He's not exactly the same player but he's a striker that can play up on the backline and is also good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.\"",
      "To have been compared to a striker that has been linked with the likes of United, Liverpool, Newcastle United and Barcelona over the last few months is a credit to Biancheri and his development.",
      "He was United's most prolific goalscorer in the academy this season, scoring 25 times for the Under-18s and Under-21s combined, meaning he ended the season with more goals to his name than fellow exciting youngster Chido Obi, who has already gatecrashed the first-team at the age of just 17.",
      "Of course, the gulf between youth football and senior football is huge, and no shortage of former United youngsters who have prospered in the academy have failed to make the grade when first-team opportunities have presented themselves, meaning there is no guarantee Biancheri will be able to replicate his form at youth level in a first-team environment.",
      "Nevertheless, just the fact he has been mentioned in the same breath as David will almost certainly do wonders for the youngster's confidence, who will have ambitions of catching Ruben Amorim's eye in the future.",
      "David, who has often been linked with United over the past year or so, confirmed earlier this month he will be leaving Lille after five successful years at the French club which saw him score 109 goals in 232 games.",
      "Available on a free transfer this summer, he would have been a striker worthy of pursuing had United secured Champions League qualification. The 25-year-old scored seven goals in ten games in Europe's premier club competition this season and will have ambitions of playing in the Champions League against next term.",
      "Although Biancheri is yet to prove himself at first-team level, Marsch's decision to compare him with David must make United believe they have a prospect on their hands. His goalscoring record this season has been impressive and his potential is exciting.",
      "Despite David being available on a free, his wages will not be cheap, meaning if United play their cards right with Biancheri and continue to oversee his development in the right manner, they might just have an alternative on their hands in the future."

      "When former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag was announced as Bayer Leverkusen manager last week it created quite a bit of intrigue for a number of reasons.",
      "Not least because he is replacing Xabi Alonso as manager who has left an untouchable legacy at the BayArena as he prepares to take over as Real Madrid boss.",
      "Not only did Alonso deliver the club their first ever Bundesliga title last year, he won an unprecedented unbeaten domestic double as they won the DFB Pokal, too.",
      "Following in his footsteps is daunting for any manager, never mind one with the circumstances Ten Hag is coming in with.",
      "First of all, he has to shake off the failure of how his United tenure ended. The Dutchman won two trophies in two seasons at United but abandoned the style of play that brought him success at Ajax. As league results badly regressed it ultimately that led to his dismissal in October 2024.",
      "And he is inheriting a Leverkusen side who might have finished second in the Bundesliga last season but look set to lose their three most valuable players this summer.",
      "Centre-back Jonathan Tah has left the club on a free transfer and signed for their main rivals Bayern Munich on a four-year deal. Meanwhile, right-wing-back Jeremie Frimpong and attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz are both expected to join Liverpool.",
      "Those deals will give Ten Hag money to spend but they may have to take some steps backwards before they start to move forward again in his rebuild.",
      "Then there is the question of whether Ten Hag will raid United for any new signings. One suggestion that has been mooted, although it always seemed unlikely, was for Leverkusen to reunite Ten Hag with United goalkeeper Andre Onana.",
      "The pair enjoyed an excellent relationship at Ajax and United spent £43.8million to sign him from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023.",
      "His two years at United have been error strewn and there is talk of them reshuffling goalkeeping pack. That naturally led to people putting two and two together to make five and suggesting Leverkusen might be in the market for the Cameroon international.",
      "But that has been nipped in the bud quickly with Leverkusen's plans for their goalkeeping department becoming clearer this week.",
      "Leverkusen want stronger competition for club captain Lukas Hradecky, with former United youngster Matej Kovar their current second choice goalkeeper.",
      "And they are said to be close to signing Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken to provide just that, with the Bees reportedly moving to sign Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher as the Dutch international's replacement.",
      "The Irish international is keen to leave Liverpool for first team football having had to play second fiddle to Alisson and would have been demoted to third choice this summer amid the imminent arrival of Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "The transfer dominoes are falling for Leverkusen but none of them include Onana. Instead, as has always been likely, the more probable goalkeeping departure this summer at United will be Altay Bayindir.",
      "The Turkish international has failed to convince in his two years at United and could look for first team football ahead of a World Cup year. United would then buy another goalkeeper to provide stronger competition for Onana.",
      "Despite his struggles, he remains committed to becoming a success at United and any reunion with Ten Hag won't be happening - at least this summer anyway."

      "Manchester United's defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur was the latest in what seems to be a catalogue of humiliating events for the club in the past year.",
      "In front of 72,000 supporters, United lost to a second half goal from Maung Maung Lwin. The result means very little, a post-season friendly has little riding on it, but the pure manner of another defeat has opened up Ruben Amorim's men to more repartee.",
      "As social media is the way that it is, any amusing moments are highlighted. The open-top bus which included a number of United players in Malaysia created the opportunity for rival fans to poke fun at the club. During the game, it was Rasmus Hojlund who was the subject of jibes.",
      "Much has been made of the striker's form this season. The 22-year-old scored just 10 goals for United, with the club looking to strengthen that department this summer and the young forward could be allowed to leave.",
      "On Wednesday, Hojlund started and offered an opportunity to gain some sort of confidence. However, he failed to score and came away from the friendly with some criticism. In the 24th minute, a piece of play summed-up his struggles.",
      "As United cleared the ball, Hojlund collected it and attempted to play, what should have been, a simple lay-off. Instead, it was wayward and the All-Stars launched another attack. Whilst his finishing has been a topic of conversation, his ability to aid United in transition hasn't been good enough.",
      "A new striker is expected to be signed this summer to not only score goals and increase the output in front of goal, but also improve United's overall play. If Amorim wants success, a proper number nine would give them the best chance.",

      "After watching his side lose, Pep Guardiola handed praise to Lisandro Martinez, suggesting he \"made the difference\". The defender started alongside Raphael Varane in defence and succeeded in keeping Erling Haaland quiet.",
      "However, it was the Argentine's ball-playing qualities that Guardiola was envious of. Martinez completed 90% of his 20 passes and the City boss handed the United defender a big compliment. \"Lisandro Martinez is top five centre-backs in the world,\" he said. \"He made the difference on this game by playing passes through our defence.\"",
      "A centre-forward, like Liam Delap or Viktor Gyokeres, would give Martinez a target to aim for with his line-breaking passes. Whilst goals are the priority from Amorim's new forward, signing a player with the ability to receive the ball on the spin and spearhead counters could really elevate the Portuguese's system next season.",
      "After Matheus Cunha arrives from Wolves, the next signing in Amorim's dream scenario is a striker. It's over to Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada to supply United with that."

      "However, it was not just Liga Portugal where the former Coventry City man was excelling. He scored 54 goals in total across all competitions including six in eight Champions League matches.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Gyokeres was comfortably crowned the player of the season in Liga Portugal, an accolade he shared with his 2.8m Instagram followers. Such sensational form has led the striker, who turns 27 on Wednesday, to be heavily linked with a number of Premier League clubs.",
      "United have been one of the teams to find themselves linked with the striker and were believed to be in a good position having poached Ruben Amorim from Sporting in November. However, the Reds' lack of Champions League football next season has meant the club's transfer plans have been reined in.",
      "Arsenal have also held a strong, long-term interest in Gyokeres and with Champions League football secured, Mikel Arteta's team are expected to make a move for the striker. Their new sporting director Andrea Berta is also thought to be a fan of the Swede.",
      "On Wednesday, a report from The Guardian claimed that Sporting had told interested clubs that Gyokeres will be available for no less than £67m. They added that Arsenal are likely to test their resolve soon with the transfer window opening on Sunday, June 1.",
      "United may struggle to pay £67m for Gyokeres without ensuring sales are agreed first. Wolverhampton Wanderers' Matheus Cunha is expected to be their first signing of the summer with his £62.5m release clause set to be triggered."

      "Premier League legend Alan Shearer has raised concerns over what he perceived as \"rows\" between Manchester United and Wolves surrounding Matheus Cunha's proposed move to Old Trafford.",
      "All signs have suggested for some time that the Brazil international is bound for Old Trafford, but there were some bumps in the road earlier this week that could have blocked the transfer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has long been aware funds would likely be tight this summer. However, the club's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham tightened the purse strings even further, with United now missing out on European football altogether next term.",
      "The club finds itself in the difficult position of needing to offload certain stars to free up more of a transfer budget. And Newcastle great Shearer worried for their chances of landing Cunha due to these developments, as Wolves made clear they weren't going to roll over in negotiations.",
      "\"Who they sell, I don't know. If they need to raise funds then they have a couple of options to do that,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"It looks as if the Cunha deal is going to happen albeit I saw that there's rows in terms of how payments will be made.\"",
      "The deal now appears on again after United agreed to pay the fee in three instalments over two years. Cunha, 26, is now clear to undergo a medical at Carrington in what could end up being United's biggest deal of 2025.",
      "The former RB Leipzig and Atletico Madrid forward, who scored 33 goals in 92 appearances for Wolves, offers a great deal of versatility in attack. And yet Shearer warned there is plenty of work to be done in renovating the squad before United can challenge for the top six once more.",
      "He continued: \"Man United need an overhaul but it won't happen in one or two transfer windows and that's why, as a player, you have to think long and hard about needing or wanting to go there because it's going to take two or three years to get anywhere near the levels to challenge for the top six again.",
      "\"If funds are going to be tight due to PSR then their assets in [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Bruno] Fernandes may have to be sold to bring funds in. Nothing surprises me with Man United on or off the field anymore because they've been an embarrassment over the last 12 months.\"",
      "Cunha himself has suggested a summer move is in the offing after appearing to thank fans for his time at the club. Wolves' official Instagram account shared a video of their supporters serenading the player following the final game of the season, and Cunha's reaction in the comments section hinted at his intentions.",
      "\"I can’t thank you enough for so much,\" wrote Cunha in response. And many have taken that as a form of farewell, hinting his time at Molineux is almost at its end.",
      "Garnacho, 20, is available for sale after falling out with Amorim, who dropped him from the squad that beat Aston Villa on the last day of the season. It's believed United are hoping to fetch up to £70m for the player, but their bargaining position appears weak.",
      "The club will be much more desperate to keep hold of captain Fernandes, who was linked with the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid earlier this year, while a switch to Saudi Arabia is most likely at this stage if he is to go.",
      "Meanwhile, United may struggle to drum up interest in many other stars after a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League."

      "Saudi Pro League newcomers Neom SC are prepared to make a stunning offer to sign Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana this summer, it has been claimed.",
      "Onana's long-term future is uncertain, less than two years since his £47million arrival from Inter Milan. The Cameroon international, signed by Erik ten Hag, enjoyed a mixed debut season at Old Trafford but his form has declined this term, having kept just 11 clean sheets in 50 appearances.",
      "He made three errors leading to a goal in the Premier League - the fifth-most of any 'keeper - and that has led to speculation increasing regarding a possible exit. According to The Mirror, Neom, who earned promotion to the Saudi top-flight last month, are eyeing up a move for Onana.",
      "Neom have the backing of Newcastle's owners, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, meaning there is cash to spend. A deal involving Onana would be expected to cost in the region of £35m - a fee that would help boost United's financial situation and give them a major cash injection for the summer window.",
      "Newcastle's owners, PIF, have control of several clubs in Saudi Arabia, including the big four: Al-Ahli, Al-Ittihad, Al-Hilal, and Al-Nassr. They completed the takeover of Neom, however, back in January 2019 and have been in full control of the club ever since, spearheading their push to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Onana, 29, who has three years left on his contract at United, would earn a reported £15m a year if he joined the Saudi First Division champions. Former West Ham and Brentford midfielder Said Benrahma spent the second-half of the season on loan at Neom and helped them earn promotion.",
      "After Onana faced criticism for not keeping out Brennan Johnson's effort during the Europa League final defeat against Tottenham last Wednesday, Ruben Amorim dropped him to face Aston Villa on Sunday. Instead, Altay Bayindir was handed a start and impressed in a 2-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "Explaining why Onana, Luke Shaw and Leny Yoro were left out of the squad against Villa, Amorim said: \"Luke Shaw has a problem in his foot, Leny the same thing – two games before he had an issue and we want to protect the future of our clubs. Altay (Bayindir) is getting some time as a goalkeeper to experience football matches.\"",
      "Last month, Fabrizio Romano revealed that Onana is determined to remain at United for the long-term, despite speculation surrounding his future. \"At the moment, it's important to clarify that Onana wants to stay at Manchester United and compete at his best level as long as possible,\" Romano said. \"It's his desire to change the situation, help the team, continue at Old Trafford and follow his dream.",
      "\"At the same time, Man United's management - together with Ruben Amorim - will assess the goalkeeper situation to decide how they want to proceed with that position in the summer transfer window.",
      "\"So the situation could be open and it's an interesting one to follow.\""

      "As soon as the final whistle was sounded in Bilbao last week, preparations for what Manchester United had to do in order to reverse their fortunes next season were already underway.",
      "Defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham Hotspur denied United a spot in the Champions League and the potential revenue pot of some £120m that comes with it, and left the club without any kind of European revenue to rely on next season following a dismal campaign where they finished 15th, the worst season for the Red Devils in 51 years.",
      "There is much work to be done at Old Trafford, and club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who acquired a 27.7% stake in the club back in December 2023 for £1.2bn, has already embarked on brutal cost cutting through redundancies, and the lack of additional revenue from Europe next season will mean that the £100m transfer budget for the summer that has been mooted will need to be supplemented by some effective player trading.",
      "It has been widely reported that there are no players who aren’t available to leave if the right offer comes in, and that includes the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, while the most likely contenders to head out of the exit door are the likes of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho. There are also question marks that exist over the futures of Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia, Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "With the likely arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £62.5m and Liam Delap of Ipswich Town being a prime target and having a £30m release clause, that £100m can get swallowed up pretty quickly. United’s needs run far deeper that just two additions, and in order to add in other areas to not only improve competitiveness but also to replace players who will be leaving the squad and leaving it thinner, they will need to raise the extra funds themselves through player trading.",
      "But how much profit might they be expected to make in the current market?",
      "When a player is signed for a club their guaranteed transfer fee is accounted for via amortisation, which is the fee divided over the length of contract, capped at a maximum of five years. That figure goes down each year of a contract until they no longer hold any remaining book value for the football club.",
      "When a club sells a player, to realise any profit on the deal they must first clear the book value that remains of the player. In the case of academy graduates that have come through the club’s own system, there is no book value to be had and sales can immediately be booked in their entirety as pure profit.",
      "For United, the sales of Rashford, Mainoo and Garnacho would all count as pure profit from an accounting perspective and would enable the club to significantly improve their financial situation, although the need would remain for them to bring in replacements. The noises from United are that the market they are looking at will be cheaper undervalued talent after they have completed their acquisitions of Cunha and potentially Delap.",
      "What they want to receive and what they can realistically expect will likely be two different things this summer, with the poor performance of the club and players, where players have been sent out on loan or fallen out of favour, meaning that the market value has diminished and United have minimal leverage. Other clubs know the situation at Old Trafford, they know they need to sell to buy and they know that there is no position of strength in negotiations on the United side.",
      "But those fees seem high, especially given that analysts at Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory, which uses a variety of scientific methods to evaluate transfer market value, has Hojlund as the only United player to have a market value above £60m.",
      "But Hojlund is one of the players that United will reportedly listen to offers for. The club paid £72m for the Danish forward from Italian side Atalanta in 2023. It was a five-year deal that amortised as £14.4m per year. He has spent two years at the club meaning he has a remaining book value of £43.2m, and United would have to clear that first before making any kind of profit. Given his poor season it is hard to imagine he commands a £43m price tag, or that there would be many willing spenders at that fee.",
      "Then there is Antony. United’s decision to send him on loan to Real Betis has paid off, with the Brazilian finding good form away from Old Trafford, something that will have positively impacted his transfer value. But having paid £82m for him three years ago, and with a remaining book value of around £32m, United would likely still make a loss, albeit probably a smaller one than had been expected. A valuation of £25m to £30m seems to be the market consensus.",
      "Casemiro was another major arrival for big money, signed for £70m three years ago. With a remaining book value of £17.5m after he arrived on a four-year deal, means that the club would almost certainly take a loss given his age and fact he has just one year remaining on his deal. A move to Saudi Arabia might potentially offer them a route to break even, but someone would have to be willing to stump up his reported £350,000 per week, or at least be close to it.",
      "Players like Malacia, given the relatively small outlay of £14.7m in 2022, could deliver a small profit for United given he only has a book value remaining of £3.7m on his four-year deal. That would likely be recouped and profit made. But it wouldn’t change the game for United.",
      "In the case of Sancho, whose loan spell at Chelsea has been indifferent, he was signed for £73m in 2021. His book value will stand at around £14.6m, and with a tag of £25m they will be aiming to turn a small profit, although it remains to be seen whether Chelsea will take that option up or take the £5m penalty for not signing him as per the loan agreement. His wages are significant at a reported £350,000 per week (£18.2m per year) and adding those kind of wages off the bill to Casemiro, Garnacho and Rashford could shave some £50m per year off the wage bill that can be reinvested into cheaper talent with a high ceiling.",
      "Fernandes has been linked with an exit, with rumours of Saudi clubs being willing to part with as much as £80m for the 31-year-old Portuguese. That seems far fetched given his age and profile. He would make a profit for United on any significant sale, and if offered such a sum it would be near impossible to turn down, but he remains United’s most talismanic figure.",
      "The profit for United this summer will come from selling home grown players, and the lack of profit to come from selling players they have recruited in recent years speaks to just how poor that recruitment has been, and how profligate they have been with transfer funds.",
      "They will need to sell their pure profit players, while the sale of big earners will clear space in the wage bill. All told it could allow United another £120m or so to put to work over and adove the committed £100m, but would give them little time to do it.",
      "It remains a work in process that will require several windows to unpick the financial and competitive damage that has been done over a number of years worth of bad decisions."

      "When Mainoo started against the Hammers at Old Trafford earlier this month, he was also deployed as a No.10, suggesting that is where head coach Amorim believes he can be the most effective.",
      "The England international has been in out of the team this calendar year, struggling to nail down a starting berth, with his starting position often rotating between the No.8 position and the No.10 position.",
      "Mainoo is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder who likes to get on the ball and advance the play. When Amorim was appointment last November, many believed the United academy graduate would form half of the Portuguese's first-choice midfield pairing alongside Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Instead, though injuries have not helped him this season, he has struggled to nail down a place in the team. He was restricted to just one minute of action in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and was left on the bench from the start of the season finale against Aston Villa four days later.",
      "United are open to offers for all their players this summer, meaning even Mainoo, who many believe Amorim should be attempting to build his team around, could be sold.",
      "United are understood to be making progress on a deal to bring Matheus Cunha to Old Trafford for a fee of £62.5million. United identified the Wolves ace as a top target to strengthen their attacking options several months ago and he is a tailor-made fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "A specialist No.10, the Brazilian is set to be added to Amorim's squad with the task of being a regular starter. It is widely believed he will occupy the left-sided No.10 position.",
      "Amid that expectation, Bruno Fernandes, despite not being assured of his Old Trafford future, could find himself pulling the strings from midfield next season. He has proven on countless occasions that he is equally capable of operating as a No.8, dictating proceedings from a more reserved role.",
      "Should Cunha start as the left-sided No.10 and Fernandes drops into midfield, it would be logical for Amorim to partner the latter with a defensive specialist in the engine room. Mainoo, as already mentioned, is a forward-thinking midfielder, meaning he is not the answer.",
      "Partnering him with Fernandes in the centre of midfield would leave United too vulnerable to attacks. They must have a defensive shield to compliment Fernandes' desire to get forward.",
      "Amorim has shown in recent weeks he is a huge fan of Mason Mount, with his place in the starting line-up in San Mames last week arguably the team news headline. The midfielder will be hoping he can kick on next season after another difficult season with injuries.",
      "Amad is another player who will be pushing to start as one of the two No.10s. However, he is still a long-term option for Amorim at right wing-back.",
      "Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo has been linked with United this week, and it is fair to say he would be a statement signing after an impressive 20-goal haul this season. If he was to move to Old Trafford, he would be a guaranteed starter as the right-sided No.10.",
      "Much of United's recruitment this summer will rest on outgoings, and that is no secret. But should they find themselves in a position where they land Cunha and potentially Mbeumo as well, Mainoo could find himself struggling to get into the starting XI.",
      "A player of his talent will not be content with sitting on the bench every week.",

Ratcliffe said: \"If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we're buying Antony, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying [Jadon] Sancho.",
      "\"These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things, and have to sort it out. For Sancho, who now plays for Chelsea and we pay half his wages, we're paying £17m to buy him in the summer. It takes time for us to move away from the past into a new place in the future.\"",
      "Sancho appears to have settled in west London, having enjoyed a brilliant end to the season. Speaking to the official club website upon his arrival at Chelsea, he said: \"London is where I grew up and I’m happy to be back. Chelsea is iconic.",
      "\"My idols growing up were Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard and now I have the opportunity to play for this club like them. It’s a great feeling.\"",
      "Then, in November, Sancho added: \"For me, ever since I was growing up, Chelsea just seemed to be like a family, a winning culture. I remember when Chelsea were in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona.",
      "\"I was with my friend and he bet me…he said if Chelsea won he would do some sort of forfeit. I can’t remember the forfeit, I just remember that when Ramires scored that chip away, he was upset!",
      "\"And then obviously Fernando Torres scored that last-minute goal to close the game out. It was funny. Then, obviously, the final speaks for itself. Drogba coming in clutch.",
      "\"For them to just bounce back the way they did, it just shows the mentality of top players, top teams, and top coaches...\""

      "Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada has said the club must be \"prudent\" but \"ambitious\" in the summer transfer window.",
      "United have just suffered the worst season in the club's modern history, and Ruben Amorim is looking to strengthen his squad in the summer to hit the ground running in 2025/2026.",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to be the first signing of the summer and more transfers will follow.",
      "Berrada provided a rare interview to MUTV on Wednesday afternoon and revealed an update on transfer plans. \"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now,\" he told MUTV.",
      "\"We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do. We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve.",
      "\"So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition\".",
      "Berrada continued: \"Ruben spoke really well on Sunday, and he's right: the past is the past. It's important to learn, as I said, now we need to stay together, stay United and I say thank you to the fans again.",
      "\"The owner has also been really supportive in the transition here and now we just need to work really hard and do everything we can to bring the club back to the top and I'm very excited about what is coming. I'm sure the good days will be back.\"",
      "Speaking about the season, Berrada said: \"It's a privilege to work for this club. It's been a difficult season and we're undergoing a transformation on and off the pitch.",
      "\"We had to take some really tough decision to put the club in the best place possible for the future and our fans have been incredibly supportive and patient throughout this process and I can only say thank you.",
      "\"Now, really our job is to focus on the future and learn from what has happened this season, improve and make sure we continue aiming to get back to the top again.\"",
      "Berrada also spoke about the post-season tour. \"The fans have been incredible since the moment we landed,\" he added. \"It's really good to be back here. We have really passionate fans around the world.",
      "\"They are very loyal to our team. People are still hurting from the loss last week, we all wanted to end the season with a trophy. But the players, the coaches and the staff are doing very well and I think they're very focused now on engaging with our fans and starting to think about next season.\""

      "Manchester United's fast-approach in the summer transfer window to land Matheus Cunha has raised expectations around the club for next season. But if they don't build on it, it'll be for nothing.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished 15th in the Premier League and lost in the Europa League final meaning it is, officially, the club's worst season in 51 years. The Portuguese is being backed but a difficult start could see United repeat the Erik ten Hag sacking earlier this season.",
      "United need at least two or three new players through the door. After Cunha, a striker to be the focal point followed by another attacking-creator is expected to be prioritised. A new goalkeeper and midfielder are also being linked.",
      "As has been the case since January, player sales are going to play a crucial part in United getting the right signings through the door. Millions are expected to be raised through the sales of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho but Alejandro Garnacho's exit could work out a treat.",
      "The winger is increasingly likely to leave United this summer with Amorim understood to have informed him to find a new club. Garnacho nearly left the club in January and sparked further uncertainty with his comments in the aftermath of the Europa League defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Interest in Italy has been apparent since the winter with Napoli reportedly still keen. However, recent revelations have reported that AC Milan have discussed Garnacho internally amid the unsettling situation with Rafael Leao.",
      "According to Argentine outlet Ole, Milan have opened negotiations for Garnacho and believe £50million would be enough to get him out of Manchester and to the San Siro. Whilst that fee is slightly lower than the reported £65m that United would seek for the Argentine, accepting that proposal would be the perfect green light for Amorim's second signing.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on United's radar and after scoring 20 Premier League goals this season, is destined for a move away from Brentford. Newcastle and Arsenal are also considering moves with the Bees reportedly demanding between £50m-£60m.",
      "\"I know that Bryan is very happy being here at Brentford, he's thriving, doing well and playing fantastic. What happens in the future? I don't know. I've said many times: we are a selling club. But at the same time we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world who aren't selling clubs.",
      "\"So, of course, if the right price - and that's going to be expensive - is coming, then I'm sure the club will be open for it. But I'm very happy he's here, and I'm convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.\"",
      "Selling Garnacho, a player who doesn't suit Amorim's system, to bring in Mbeumo - one of the Premier League's most consistent performers in the past 12 months - for the same price would be a masterstroke from Ineos."

      "The Blues have a £25m obligation to make Sancho’s loan move from United permanent, but they could break that agreement for the 25-year-old – who’s got five goals and ten assists this season – if they pay the Red Devils £5m.",

      "",
      "2) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024.

      "Manchester United have been treading on rakes in the transfer market for a decade now; selling Bruno Fernandes would be the most catastrophic mis-step yet.",
      "Apparently, the clock is ticking on Al-Hilal’s offer to make Fernandes their marquee player ahead of the Club World Cup. That in isolation is not an offer that you would expect to tempt the United captain. But £700,000 a week is a sweetener few could simply dismiss without serious consideration.",
      "If Fernandes is turned on by the prospect of selling his wares in Saudi, then United could expect to receive an offer of around £100million for their skipper. The response should be a firm and final ‘no’.",
      "No doubt the prospect of immediately filling the black hole in the books dug in Bilbao will appeal to the bean counters at Old Trafford. But at some point amid the scrimping and saving, they have to remember they are a football club. And without Fernandes they might have been a football club playing Championship football next season.",
      "The skipper’s influence cannot be overstated. Not only does he make this iteration of United something close to watchable, but he was involved in 40% of their goals last season, continuing his frankly ludicrous consistency with 19 goals and 20 assists in a team that for large swathes of the season had forgotten how to score.",
      "How would United replace Fernandes’ productivity if they took the Saudi cash? Lord knows the answer doesn’t lie within. They would have to spend the same again to gamble on getting anything like the same output from a new recruit, completely defeating the purpose of the sale. And would you back anyone at Old Trafford to pick a winner these days, let alone one to produce on Fernandes’ scale?",
      "There can be no ignoring United’s need for cash this summer. These days, stories of cutbacks rival transfer gossip for sheer volume. INEOS and the Glazers have shown that anyone is fair game, but assuming they wish one day to be taken seriously again as a football club, a line has to be drawn somewhere in the dressing-room, even if only around the pegs of Fernandes’ and Amad Diallo.",
      "You could make a reasonable argument for selling any other player. If Ruben Amorim really thinks so little of Kobbie Mainoo, or United were offered a profit on Leny Yoro, you might pick through the logic while saying goodbye through gritted teeth.",
      "So with almost a squad’s worth of players to take to market, United for the first time in over a decade need to sell smartly. And there’s nothing remotely clever about selling your best player and severely weakening Amorim’s ranks in one misguided motion.",
      "Amorim stated his case when he was asked about selling his captain earlier this month…",
      "“No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him! I want Bruno here because we want to win the Premier League again, so we want the best players to continue with us. He’s 30, but he’s still so young, because he plays 55 games every season. Between assists and goals, he’s there for 30 at least, so he’s the type of player we want here and he’s not going anywhere.”",
      "The beleaguered boss is already having a hard time asserting his authority while hiding his disdain for the group at his disposal. If United vetoed Amorim over Fernandes, the manager might as well follow the captain through the exit door.",
      "During his seven months in charge, Amorim has repeatedly backed Fernandes in the face of criticism from outside Old Trafford, most strikingly when it came again from one of the current captain’s predecessors. Roy Keane is among the many who take issue with Fernandes and his flailing arms. But if Keane was leading this mob, blood would spatter the dressing room walls. Actually, Keane would most likely have walked away long ago in fury at his team-mates’ inability to match his standards. And few would blame Fernandes for doing the same. He really is better than this.",
      "MORE MAN UTD OPINION FROM F365\n👉 Man Utd and Spurs insulated from failure; Premier League needs its jeopardy back\n👉 Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",

      "Villa hold a £40m buy option but the decision is Rashford’s, and the 27-year-old is doing everything he can to force a move to the Catalan giants, including a willingness to drastically reduce his current £325,000 per week wages.",

      "Barcelona are said to be ‘very clear on their preference’ as they seek a ‘loan with a buy option’, with it suggested that the Red Devils could be open to a compromise to offload Rashford on ‘advantageous loan terms’ amid their ‘very serious problem with the player’.",
      "Another possible way of getting the deal done would be for Barcelona to send United a player in exchange, and a report from Spanish outlet Nacional claims there are two players Ruben Amorim ‘likes very much’.",
      "The Portuguese boss believes Ronald Araujo can ‘solve the problems’ in defence despite having ‘been clearly surpassed by Inigo Martínez and Pau Cubarsi, and even by Eric Garcia and Andreas Christensen’ at Barcelona.",

      "United ‘would also be delighted to exchange Fermin Lopez’, who’s also valued at around the €50m mark, though Hansi Flick is said to be loathe to lose the 22-year-old, who has been in and out of the team for much of the season, but finished the campaign in fine form, with three goals and an assist from midfield in the last four La Liga games.",
      "Meanwhile, Simon Jordan claims Rashford only has himself to blame for not being wanted by his boyhood club.",
      "“Marcus has created the problem by his performances,” Jordan said on talkSPORT. “The only reason people want him out of Man United is because he hasn’t turned up for Man United.",

      "Lewis looked destined for greatness, but this has been a tricky year. With the stars around him struggling, Lewis has looked more like a vulnerable kid than the composed upstart we saw last season. From looking alarmingly comfortable in midfield to being out of his depth, and from solid to defensively frail – next season’s huge. A loan feels beneath him.",

      "Manchester United’s loss was supposed to be West Ham’s gain, but the French centre-back had a poor season in a wildly underperforming team.",
      "Todibo played 27 league matches and his loan from Nice will become permanent in the summer for over £30million, for West Ham’s sins. Having officially splashed the cash, the Hammers will be desperate to see some improvement, especially when it comes to one-on-one defending as demonstrated at Ipswich on Sunday.",

He just seems to be a bad fit for Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs, but he came into the season off a really impressive Euro 2024 which adds to the disappointment.",
      "Being surpassed by Kevin Danso hasn’t helped – especially when the January signing is still no more than a back-up centre-back, but far more the right kind of back-up centre-back.",

      "The Alfie Doughty comparisons were thrown around early, but Davis never came close. Just two assists – despite taking set-pieces all year – isn’t good enough. We expected more from him, and naively, Ipswich.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Ian Maatsen and Oleksandr Zinchenko.",
      "",
      "CM: Kalvin Phillips (Ipswich Town)\nWe have no idea where poor Kalvin Phillips goes from here. Leeds United, probably. But will they even want their old fan favourite after a miserable campaign at another newly-promoted team? We’d be surprised, but there’s no future for him at Man City.",
      "The player who bossed games for Leeds and England looks long gone. Now 29, this summer is career-defining. He played just 30 minutes across Ipswich’s final nine league games.",
      "",

      "United’s struggles aren’t on him, but we still expected more from someone who seemed ready to assume the role of a team leader. He’s not being written off – far from it – but that next step might not be in Manchester. Defeat in the Europa League final could force the club’s hand financially.",
      "Worryingly, he already looks a bit leggy. He’s dropped down Ruben Amorim’s pecking order, despite seemingly fitting the 3-4-3 like a glove.",

      "",
      "RW: Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nFrom Premier League Player of the Season to Phlop of the Season.",
      "Problems in his personal life have contributed to a bitterly disappointing year, but we all know there is a world-class player in there. Getting adequate rest to recover physically and mentally will go a long way to Foden coming Back Stronger in 2025/26.",
      "Foden only scored or assisted in six games all season, with a purple patch in January (six goals, one assist in four games) followed by a costly mistake against Arsenal and a complete fade-out. The 24-year-old didn’t score or assist from February onwards.",
      "",
      "AM: Martin Odegaard (Arsenal)\nThe Arsenal captain fell from the highest high from every attacking midfielder in the Premier League, but not necessarily to the lowest low. Christopher Nkunku, Fabio Carvalho, Joshua Zirkzee and Lucas Paqueta arguably reached deeper depths of despair.",
      "Odegaard has been the heartbeat of this Arsenal team since 2021/22 but his performances undoubtedly dipped this campaign. The ankle injury he suffered in September clearly hindered him for the rest of the campaign as his influence waned.",
      "The Norwegian recorded assists in five of Arsenal’s last six Premier League matches but all they did was paper over the cracks, especially in the home defeat to Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "LW: Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)\nYes, Son recorded 17 goal involvements in 30 league games. But if you actually watched him…",
      "Those passable numbers are a testament to the player he is/was but he’s become slow, ponderous, and seemingly unsure of himself. He used to be the exact opposite: exciting and vibrant. He’s lost half a yard in the legs and in his head.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Raheem Sterling and Federico Chiesa.",
      "",
      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United)\nA shaky debut season was to be expected, especially when there was an outstanding purple patch before an unfortunate injury. But showing no signs of improvement, only regression, has left the club’s supporters fearing they’ve signed a dud.",
      "He only scored four goals across the entire Premier League campaign. That’s the same number of goal involvements as Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson. Not only has Hojlund shown a lack of conviction in front of goal, but his overall play has been very poor.",
      "By almost every metric, he ranks near the bottom for Premier League strikers: take-ons, penalty-box touches, passes, aerials, shots, assists… the lot. Even his xG per 90 (0.33) is worrying for a main striker.",
      "Dishonourable mention: Evan Ferguson. It’s arguable that as a disappointment, Ferguson blows Hojlund out of the water. The latter being worse than last season was half-expected, but people were hyping Ferguson all the way to the moon.",
      "",
      "Manager: Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nSeven wins, six draws, 14 defeats. A 15th-place finish. Knocked out in the Carabao Cup quarters and FA Cup last 16, and defeated in the Europa League final. Miserable.",

      "The gap between the Premier League and Championship has become a gulf. The last six teams promoted into the Premier League have been relegated straight back out of it.",
      "All the while, 17 teams become richer, more deeply entrenched and ever harder to shift. Will next season really be hugely different?",
      "There’s always been a gap between the Premier League and the Championship, obviously, but all our number-crunching a few years ago suggested that despite claims to the contrary, that gap had not really grown for about 25 years.",
      "It was there in the numbers. Sides going down to the second tier were no more likely to bounce straight back up than they’d ever been, and sides coming up to the top flight were no more likely to go straight back down than they’d ever been. The complaints about the growing gap in quality was, at that point, the kind of vague ‘sort of feels like it though doesn’t it’ claim that we’re all prone to after a pint.",
      "That’s changed completely since the last massive increase in TV money. The distance between the Premier League and the Championship is now an absolute chasm.",
      "It’s not that the second tier has got worse, either. I’ve seen more Championship football over the past 16 years than any other level of football, and can tell you the standard has risen if anything. One colleague told me in a press room this season that he had been watching old mid-table Premier League games from 2005 as research for a piece, and that it looked exactly like the Championship does now.",
      "The standard in the Premier League, as an average across the division, is just now so unbelievably high, because even a pretty mediocre side can go out and outspend all but the biggest behemoths in European football for transfer fees and wages. We got something like confirmation of that in the Europa League: Manchester United and Tottenham both reached the final – and deservedly so – despite being absolute crap in the Premier League, finishing 15th and 17th.",
      "That should be a good thing, but it is desperately hurting the case of any newly-promoted sides, for whom the only reasonable expectation now is that they will go straight back down to the Championship…where the expectation now (admittedly not fulfilled this season, especially not by League One-bound Luton) is that they will go straight back up.",
      "The Premier League has always been depressingly myopic and uncaring about this kind of thing, because they sit separate from the rest of the pyramid and almost exclusively vote in ways that assume that they will be Premier League clubs forever and never ever get relegated.",
      "If that was short-sighted and self-defeating before, it’s now actually becoming the case – and is only likely to get worse. Premier League votes generally only need 16 out of 20 clubs to vote for them. In the current state of affairs, 17 of those clubs actually are more or less entrenched in the top flight unless they right royally screw it up in massive, massive fashion. Good for those clubs. Terrible for everyone else, including the neutral fan.",
      "We need some jeopardy back, and honestly don’t think five up, five down would be a bad idea at this point. It might at the very least get the Premier League clubs thinking about what life is like in the second tier and why narrowing the gap again would be to everybody’s benefit.",
      "You only need look at Spurs and United this season to see why and how.",
      "There’s an argument that like United, Spurs were so focused on the Europa League towards the end of the season that their league form was basically an inconvenient irrelevance to them. Even if it’s subconscious…who cares if you constantly lose when you already know you can’t get relegated even while finishing with a paltry 38 points?",
      "Well…the fans do, for one, and they were not shy about making their feelings clear.",
      "Tottenham produced lovely stuff at times – for much of the season, Liverpool were the only side to outscore them – but they were callow, callow, callow. Who’d have thought that’s what you’d get from not just building your recruitment policy around youth, but making it more or less the only criterion?",
      "That excuse only goes so far, though; Chelsea and Brighton both had younger sides on average than Tottenham this season, and they did alright in the end.",
      "While the fans have concentrated their ire mostly on Daniel Levy, the neutral’s glare has generally fallen on Ange Postecoglou and his at times stubborn insistence on ignoring some simple pragmatic steps to improve his side’s form in favour of pursuing a style of play that often feels too risky to be worthwhile.",
      "Chelsea had a similar problem for a while, but even Enzo Maresca made adaptations to address that, one-nilling their way through the closing stages of the season to secure their Champions League place.",
      "Spurs will be joining them there, of course. The Europa League trophy provided some vindication for Postecoglou, though it was amusing that their 1-0 victory in the final was almost a complete departure from what we had seen from Spurs all season. It was the third time they had won a game 1-0; the others were in their League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, and against Manchester United again in the league.",
      "We will say that despite all that…we still have a soft spot for Postecoglou and for Spurs, if only because it’s hard to dislike an amusingly chippy manager who sticks to his attacking guns so much. They are our early shout for being the most interesting side to watch next season, because it feels like they’re either going to be great or terrible with no in between.",
      "But if they are terrible, is it too much to ask that maybe that be accompanied by some actual consequences?"

      "As a result of having fewer matches to play next season, Amorim - who is hoping to bring Wolves forward Matheus Cunha to the club - wants to operate with a smaller squad that will be easier to manage next season.",
      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Having overseen a \"disastrous\" campaign at Old Trafford, in the manager's own words, Amorim says last season is now behind him as he and his players start to look forward.",
      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",
      "While predicting there will still be some more hiccups to contend with along the way, Amorim also thinks there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "\"It's important to stick together,\" he said. \"We are going to struggle, it's not going to be everything right away, but I can see the team improving and that's the most important thing.",
      "\"Our target, I will not tell you now. If you want a target, it is to win the first game, then we will see. We have a lot to do during this summer, we have to prepare the team.",
      "\"Again, when are you are in Man Utd, people are going to expect us to be on the top, but we have to understand the context, so I do not want the team to think of a big target, just the small target of winning the first game, then we pass to the second game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, not participating in Europe next season could be a positive for United as Amorim looks to build team unity going forward.",
      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better the games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he explained.",
      "\"So, it is a good thing for us to take advantage of not having European games.\"",
      "Amorim has also stressed the importance of keeping Bruno Fernandes at United this summer as rumours begin to circulate regarding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes has recently been linked with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, which led to Amorim stressing that United should try to keep \"one of the top players in the world\".",
      "The United boss has now reinforced this point, saying: \"You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the games. So it is really important, especially in these kind of moments.",
      "\"You could see that in the last game. I felt that the team was without pressure; they performed quite well and everybody wanted the ball.",
      "\"The team has different moments and in different moments, Bruno [Fernandes] is the one who really wants to take responsibility.",
      "\"He should be because he is the captain, so he's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\""

      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",

      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",

      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",

      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 17:53, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "Monday 26 May 2025 11:18, UK",
      "Bayer Leverkusen have appointed former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag as Xabi Alonso's replacement as head coach.",
      "The 55-year-old Dutchman has signed a contract running through to June 2027 with the German club.",
      "Ten Hag inherits a team that finished second behind Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga and reached the German Cup semi-finals after winning both competitions under Alonso the year before.",
      "Alonso left to take over as Real Madrid coach, replacing Carlo Ancelotti who has taken charge of the Brazil national team.",
      "It is Ten Hag's first job since he was dismissed as United coach in October 2024.",
      "He won two domestic cups in his two-and-a-half years in charge at Old Trafford but was fired after the club's worst start to a season, with four defeats in nine league games.",
      "Speaking in his first press conference after the appointment was announced, Ten Hag said: \"Bayer is one of the best clubs in Germany and also belongs to the expanded European elite.",
      "\"The club offers excellent conditions, and the discussions with the officials have impressed me greatly.",
      "\"I have come to Leverkusen to confirm the ambitions that have grown over the past few years. It is an appealing task to build something together in this phase of change and to develop an ambitious team.\"",

      "Ten Hag spent four seasons at Ajax from 2018, winning the Eredivisie three times and the KNVB Cup twice, before taking on the role at Old Trafford in 2022 where he won the FA Cup and League Cup.",
      "\"With Erik ten Hag, we are relying on an experienced coach with impressive sports successes. His six title wins with Ajax Amsterdam were exceptional,\" said Rolfes.",
      "\"With three championships and two cup victories, he and Ajax dominated Dutch football unchallenged from 2018 to 2022. And even through the subsequent successes with Manchester United under sometimes difficult conditions, Erik has proven his quality as a coach.",
      "\"Our visions of football align. With technically demanding and dominant football, we want to pursue the highest goals in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and Champions League.\""
