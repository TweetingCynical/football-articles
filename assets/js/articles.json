      "David Beckham has seemingly taken aim at Manchester United's decision to offload Scott McTominay. The 50-year-old, who, like McTominay, rose through United's academy ranks, said he \"hates\" seeing top quality youngsters being sold \"purely for financial reasons\".",
      "McTominay, now thriving at Napoli, made over 250 appearances for United before being sold for just £25.7million last summer, with then-manager Erik ten Hag claiming the move was necessary to help balance the club's books. Since making the switch to Italy, the Scotland international has been in scintillating form, playing a key role in Napoli's charge toward the Serie A title.",
      "With 18 goal contributions in all competitions, he's earned the nickname \"the bottle opener\" for his knack of scoring crucial breakthrough goals. United, meanwhile, have endured a disastrous campaign. With 18 league defeats and just two places separating them from the relegation zone, the club are staring down the barrel of their worst domestic finish in decades.",
      "Speaking to The Athletic, Beckham underscored the importance of nurturing and retaining academy graduates \"who understand the club.\" While he didn't mention McTominay by name, the timing and context of his remarks strongly suggest the midfielder was top of mind.",
      "\"I hate [the idea of] any young player who has grown up at United leaving the club. We shouldn't be selling players purely for financial reasons,\" the former England captain said.",
      "\"It should be what they are doing on the field and if they're not performing, there's always a chance [they'll be left out of the team or sold]. We all knew that, I knew that.",
      "\"If I wasn't performing on the pitch, it didn't matter what I'd done in the past or what I was going to do in the future; there was a good chance that I was either going to get left on the bench, or I was going to get sold.",
      "\"I'd like to think that Manchester United don't sell players that have grown up at the club, understand and love the club. I don't want to see players leave Manchester United if they care about United like I do.\"",
      "Beckham speaks from first-hand experience. As a key figure in United's legendary 'Class of 92' - along with Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, and Nicky Butt - he knows the value of homegrown talent. The group broke into Sir Alex Ferguson's first team, becoming regular starters and going on to win multiple Premier League titles, domestic cups, and an iconic Treble in 1999.",
      "\"We were lucky to be part of the most stable club with the same manager, owner, fans and players there for many years,\" Beckham noted. \"We know when you have stability within the club, you have success. Simple as that.\"",
      "McTominay was never afforded the same stability or trust. Across seven full seasons in United's senior squad, he played under four different managers. As a result, he was in and out of the team, often shuffled between roles, and constantly having to prove himself despite being one of the team's more consistent performers during a turbulent era.",
      "He was often treated as expendable, rather than essential. A reliable, but unremarkable, squad player, rather than a superstar. In that context, his move to Napoli made perfect sense.",
      "Under Antonio Conte, he's finally been given a clear role and the backing to thrive, emerging as the midfield engine that drives one of Europe's most exciting teams. This weekend, Napoli can clinch just the fourth Scudetto in their storied history - and only the second since the days of Diego Maradona.",
      "A win against Cagliari on the final day would see them pip Champions League finalists Inter Milan to the title - a remarkable achievement, especially considering they've had to cope with the departures of both Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in the past year.",
      "In McTominay, however, they've discovered an unexpected superstar - a midfield lynchpin who's proving that greatness doesn't always arrive with fanfare. Sometimes, it's forged quietly, through resilience, consistency, and the hunger to finally be seen. Manchester United would do well to remember that."

      "Delap appears to be their man, though both Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville believe a move for the Englishman would be a mistake. Addressing the striker directly, Carragher urged him to join a club a step below United's standing instead.",
      "\"I know people will say about league position, but Man United is a monster. I think that next step - an Everton or something - being the main man where you’re going to play every week, be the best player.",

      "Neville meanwhile believes signing Delap would replicate the same mistake United made in buying Hojlund and Zirkzee. The former Red Devils skipper insisted that the current iteration of the club is not a good place for young players.",
      "“If he comes everyone will get behind him as a young player. But we’ve seen that United has been a tough place to play in recent years for a lot of very experienced players. So we’re right to express caution in terms of what’s happening at United,\" Neville said.",
      "\"You need to be resilient, you need to be ready. So I’d hope him going there, he’d get off to a good start and have a great career if that’s the move that happens. But we are right to think about what’s happened to other players.",
      "“Hojlund came in at £70m, Zirkzee at £30m. What’s going to happen to them? Do they just leave? We’ve seen Sancho come in, Antony come in. Rashford’s going to leave. It’s interesting.",
      "“There’s a good knowledge of Delap at United at a high level. Jason Wilcox has worked with him so he’ll be having a say on this. Omar Berrada at City. So they’ll have a good understanding of his game and his character - but United is a different animal.”"

      "Rio Ferdinand reckons only a “lunatic” would be shocked to see Manchester United lose Wednesday night's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "But the club legend believes Ruben Amorim must be given significant backing in the transfer window regardless of whether they are in next season’s Champions League or not.",
      "Otherwise the head coach has no chance of implementing his vision because, Ferdinand believes, the current group is simply not equipped to execute what he wants.",
      "Asked how he feels supporters will react should they be beaten by Spurs, Ferdinand said: “I don't think the fans can be too surprised. They beat us three times already this season, so it's not going to be a surprise if they beat us a fourth time.",
      "“I think it's only going to be stupid people that are going, ‘Oh my god, I can't believe this.’ “We're 16th because we've lost a lot of games. 18 Premier League games we've lost this season. Anyone who's surprised if we don't win this game against Spurs is a lunatic, in my eyes.”",
      "Regardless Ferdinand believes Amorim needs to be afforded plenty of support from club chiefs this summer - even if the calibre of player he can potentially sign will be determined by tomorrow night’s result.",
      "Ferdinand believes it is “mind-blowing” for anyone to suggest Amorim should change his style and instead says it is simply a case of signing players with the right attributes to meet his style.",
      "“He needs time.,\" Ferdinand added. \"He hasn’t had a pre-season or a transfer window. It’s difficult, it takes time. You have to give them time to be able to implement what they want to do. He's having to change a whole style of football, a whole new formation. You ask a player what it's like to play from a four at the back to three at the back, it's hard to do that..",
      "“The biggest problem is recruitment. They've got to recruit not the best players, not the most talented players, but the players that fit Amorim’s style.”"

      "Should the move go through, Cunha would arrive at Old Trafford off the back of his most impressive season in the Premier League having found the back of the net on 15 occasions.

      "And while Carragher would be a huge fan of Cunha’s arrival at Old Trafford, he suggests it could spell the end for Garnacho’s future at the club. He added: \"There is a lot of talk about Garnacho moving on because he’s come through the academy system and we know what that means for the PSR [Profit and Sustainability Rules].",
      "“We also know Man United have got a few problems with that issue right now. I think if a decent offer comes in for Garnacho, Man United will probably take it.”",
      "He said: “They're desperate in that position, he would suit the system. When you think of the way that Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford go, three players who are natural more players who travel with the ball.",
      "“They're playing with Garnacho at the moment but that leaves them lopsided sometimes the other side, you’ve got Zirkzee when he was fit or Bruno Fernandes in moments stepping up one. Mason Mount has come in there.",
      "“They need someone who can beat players, someone who is equally as good at running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, sometimes they’ll go outside and support the wingback.",
      "“He’s the type of player you can see Manchester United being interested in to suit the system and how Ruben Amorim wants to play. They’ve lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fill those roles definitely or they’ll struggle.”"

The Red Devils legend, who spent the entirety of his career at United, has never been one to shy away from giving his analysis of his former club since stepping into the world of punditry.",
      "And the former right-back, who became all but part of the furniture at Old Trafford, has now noted that it would be unfair to judge Amorim's capabilities just yet, despite the Red Devils staring down the barrel of a dismal finish in the Premier League at present.",
      "That's because Neville understands that the Portuguese tactician has been forced to work with the squad that he inherited from Erik ten Hag after stepping up as his successor in November - a crop which doesn't exactly cater to his patented style of play.",
      "Speaking to The Athletic, Neville said: \"What they need to do now is to create some stability. There has been a lot of instability off the pitch in respect of the non-playing staff and there has been a lot of instability on the pitch with the changes of manager and changes to the squad.",
      "\"That has got to stop at some point and they’ve got to embed in Ruben’s team, let them develop. I think this time next year we’ll know a lot more, when we see whether Ruben can build a successful team.",
      "\"Christmas next year we’ll know a lot more, because I think Ruben needs to get that second transfer window. He needs a proper pre-season with the team to embed this system and this style of play.",
      "\"We’ll know a lot more in October, November, December when I’m sure they’ll be winning more matches than they are now.\" In terms of discussing a ballpark number of players needed, Neville added that United need at least six players for the best chance of success going forward.",
      "He added: \"It needs a big overhaul in the summer. Five or six players minimum to be able to change the direction of how he wants to play.",
      "\"There’s at least two forwards, a central midfield player, definitely two wing backs and another centre-back. They need six players minimum.",
      "\"Ruben has been very good at identifying the players he wants out of the club; that’s really clear to everybody. The club’s job now is to get them out and get replacements in that he likes and wants in his team.\"",
      "It's been a sad state of affairs for Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson departed the club back in 2013, with a string of world class managers trying, and failing, to fill his boots with domination of the Premier League. However, if there's any hope that Amorim will fare better than David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, or Ten Hag, then it is clear that he will need time and investment.",
      "However, the United board may struggle to finance such a lavish shopping spree for Amorim so soon, with minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe telling The Times earlier this year: \"This summer we will ‘buy’ Antony, Sancho, Casemiro, [Lisandro] Martínez, [Rasmus] Hojlund and [André] Onana and they’re all about 17 million quid each.",
      "\"Because that’s what is outstanding. If we buy nobody else we’re buying those players. But it will be a very profitable club. We believe that in three years’ time it will be the most profitable football club in the world.",
      "\"And it will be in a very, very different place. But we need to go through the change.\" The club could only afford to bring in Ayden Heaven for just north of £1m and Patrick Dorgu for £25m in the January Window, and players may need to be sold on should the board hope to have any wiggle room in terms of incoming players."

      "Mason Mount is hoping Europa League glory can help relaunch his stalled Manchester United career. England star Mount has endured a difficult time since joining United from Chelsea in a £55million deal in 2023.",
      "The attacking midfielder has spent much of the last two seasons sidelined with serious injuries and admitted it has been tough to effectively see two years of his career wiped out.",
      "Mount also suffered the heartbreak of being part of the England squad which lost the Euro 2020 final to Italy at Wembley and admitted he still carries the pain of that defeat.",
      "But Mount said beating Tottenham in Wednesday's all-or-nothing Europa League final in Bilbao would go some way towards making up for those setbacks and disappointments.",
      "\"The football side of it and the injuries is something that obviously I didn’t see coming,” said Mount, who came off the bench to score twice late on in United's 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao, which clinched their place in the final.",
      "\"That's not been easy. I've had many days sitting on the treatment bed where I want to be training. I've been in the stand watching games, when I want to be playing. But those were the circumstances.",
      "\"And I think you do remember that the losses are hard. I've had quite a few at Wembley and they stick with you for a long time.",
      "\"I don’t know how many of the lads have had too much experience of that, but I can tell you I've had quite a few losses and I don’t want that feeling again. We will do everything we can to win that game. You really appreciate it more.\"",
      "\"When you do win, you realise that feeling and you always want that feeling when you're playing in finals.",
      "Mount admitted United owe their loyal fans a trophy, having put them through the club's worst season of the Premier League era and the most calamitous since relegation in 1973-74.",
      "\"As a group, we always try to block out the noise,” said Mount. “But we know the situation we're in.",
      "\"We know the league isn't good enough and we've not been good enough in that, but the Europa League is something that we can look forward to as a final. We want to win the final. It's a trophy and it's Champions League football next season.",
      "\"We'll do everything in our power to win that game. But we won't forget about what we have done in the league and our league form.",
      "\"That's something we need to work on for next season. We know we need to work on that. This is a final and if we can win it, it can be a positive end to a tough season.",
      "\"Every single game we play at home they're there. The fans are supporting us, they're loud.",
      "\"We need to give something back. Winning the final might not solve everything, but it will give them something to cheer about and it's a trophy. Hopefully we can do that and be proud of it.\""

      "The Palace keeper, 28, was the star of the show at Wembley Stadium, making numerous saves, including one from the penalty spot, to help his side win their first-ever major trophy. Yet at the end of the game, Guardiola could be seen exchanging heated words with the England international over reported time-wasting.",
      "Henderson looks to have finally found his footballing home after spending several seasons out on loan while being on the books at Manchester United. And it was former United boss Erik ten Hag who faced the brunt of Henderson's anger when the Dutchman contacted the England star over his future in 2023.",

      "\"I didn't want the manager (Ten Hag) to come in and be able to see me in training,\" he said. \"I knew he'd probably want to keep me, so I tried to do it all before I left for the season. I told the hierarchy I need to go and play football, I don't want to be here playing second fiddle.",
      "\"It was all planned out. I was almost gone before the manager came through the door and I haven't spoken to him since.",

      "\"I got Covid, and come back, I should have still been the number one, but unfortunately, no one followed through with anything they told me.",
      "\"It was frustrating because I turned down so many good loans last summer for that reason and they wouldn't let me go. So, it was frustrating. To sit there and waste 12 months, it's criminal really at my age. I was fuming. But I worked hard off the pitch and on the training pitch to keep improving day in, day out.\"",

You saw him growing up at Man City and physically, he was always above the other players within his age group and you wondered, would he take that into professional football? He went out on a couple of loans where he wasn't fantastic and then went to Ipswich, where he's been great. You only have to look at the amount of goals he's scored in the Premier League. He seems to, particularly a few months in, have grown in arrogance – in a good way. You see him at Old Trafford (in February) and he's shoving them all over the place and he's getting stuck into it. It feels like he's at a time now where he can go and play at a top club. Unfortunately, Man United isn’t the top club at the moment, but I think bringing someone like that in would be brilliant for Man United. I think it would be a brilliant move for Delap as well.",

He knows that physically, his team are just not strong or quick enough, so Matheus Cunha is obviously athletic, and he’s got quality with 15 league goals this season. I just worry for any signing coming to Manchester United at the minute. It just feels like it’s such a bad place to go. The quality of play right now is so poor. And with Cunha, is he a centre-forward or is he a wide player? There’s no doubt that he has quality and of course, it would be nice to sign him, but I worry about where he fits in. You can sign the best three players in the world, and I think they’ll struggle coming into this team at the minute, but they’ve got to start somewhere.",

      "It has not been an eternity since Spurs last reached a European final. Merely six years. Son is the sole survivor from that all-English non-event against Liverpool.",
      "Both clubs made it to Madrid through inconceivable comebacks. The difference for Liverpool after their recovery against Barcelona was they had been there, done that. Tottenham hadn't. So their players savoured Lucas Moura's kick past Andre Onana for as long as their delirious supporters were locked inside the Amsterdam Arena.",
      "Danny Rose clutched a bottle of beer. You knew then, 24 days before the final, that Spurs did not have a prayer. The gulf in mentality between the clubs made a sixth European Cup for Liverpool a fait accompli.",
      "Many of a United persuasion are banking on their pedigree. United's worst team in decades last season salvaged it with their greatest performance of the post-Ferguson era. The current lot are doubly worse, 16th to last season's eighth, yet plundered 19 goals in six European knockout ties.",
      "Spurs have the edge on United in goal, at centre back, full back, up front and have arguably more technically rounded midfielders. The caveat is United have the matchwinners. Amad was a one-man band in attack until injury and Bruno Fernandes picked up the baton.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt would be genuine losses and Amorim would be well-advised to pick a back three featuring one centre back. But United's centre-back losses are not as considerable as those of James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, two of Tottenham's most influential footballers.",
      "Amad and Fernandes are game-deciding players, which offsets the blunt instrument Rasmus Hojlund. United regimes past and present have recruited two 20-year-old Denmark internationals for inflated fees, deemed them to be good enough to start and neither are. Yet Hojlund and Patrick Dorgu will start in Bilbao.",
      "They will hope to have gold medals, rather than be green in the face."

      "\"Leave the football before the football leaves you. The football's left him.\"",
      "Nobody needs reminding of Jamie Carragher's words on Monday Night Football when assessing Casemiro's performance against Crystal Palace last season. Casemiro hasn't left football but he may well be leaving Bilbao with the Europa League trophy.",
      "Carragher later admitted he felt his comment was harsh and would apologise to the Manchester United midfielder if he met him.",
      "To add some context, Carragher was referring specifically to Casemiro's ability to play at the top level, of which a final in Europe's secondary club competition against a team one place above the relegation zone is not, but Casemiro's United renaissance in the Europa League cannot be ignored.",
      "After a stunning maiden season in the Premier League, Casemiro was in decline for a good 18 months. His performances in the Premier League, even over the last couple of months, have done little to suggest said decline has been arrested, but in the Europa League he has found a brand of football with the pace and intensity - or lack thereof - to remind us what a brilliant player he has been.",
      "The Brazilian did not get a kick between December 30 and January 30 as United scrambled to find a buyer for the midfielder. No joy on that front, but the United bank balance's loss has been Ruben Amorim's gain.",
      "Casemiro has been a crucial part of United's run to the final of the Europa League and his start and eventual withdrawal against Chelsea on Friday night was further confirmation of what we already knew: he will be one of the 11 lining up for the Europa League anthem in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim admitted recently that he had changed his mind on Casemiro, having started to understand the best way to utilise the veteran. His running patterns were monitored and tweaked, and United are now benefiting from his performances in the Europa League.",
      "Winning Wednesday's final and qualifying for the Champions League would net United a minimum figure of £80m and, should they do so, it's not too far a stretch to say that would not have been possible without Casemiro.",
      "United have been fairly criticised for their willingness to commit to such a lucrative long-term deal for a player who was already in his 30s when he arrived on these shores.",
      "Guide United to Champions League qualification and that decision might not seem so rash."

You saw him growing up at Man City and physically, he was always above the other players within his age group and you wondered, would he take that into professional football? He went out on a couple of loans where he wasn't fantastic and then went to Ipswich, where he's been great. You only have to look at the amount of goals he's scored in the Premier League. He seems to, particularly a few months in, have grown in arrogance – in a good way. You see him at Old Trafford (in February) and he's shoving them all over the place and he's getting stuck into it. It feels like he's at a time now where he can go and play at a top club. Unfortunately, Man United isn’t the top club at the moment, but I think bringing someone like that in would be brilliant for Man United. I think it would be a brilliant move for Delap as well.",

      "However there was a factor which was bothering him.",
      "He looks like he’s got the attributes that Ruben Amorim wants. He knows that physically, his team are just not strong or quick enough, so Matheus Cunha is obviously athletic, and he’s got quality with 15 league goals this season. I just worry for any signing coming to Manchester United at the minute. It just feels like it’s such a bad place to go. The quality of play right now is so poor. And with Cunha, is he a centre-forward or is he a wide player? There’s no doubt that he has quality and of course, it would be nice to sign him, but I worry about where he fits in. You can sign the best three players in the world, and I think they’ll struggle coming into this team at the minute, but they’ve got to start somewhere.",

I don't know how and why they're sticking with us as much as they are, because we've disappointed them so many times. But they've stuck with us and they deserve something to celebrate.",

      "The secret to success in Spain for Manchester United and Tottenham this week might be finding a way to raise their game beyond the levels they have shown this season.",
      "Granted, both have displayed unexpected resolve and quality to progress to the Europa League final. United's comeback against Lyon and the destruction of Athletic Bilbao were impressive. Tottenham's away wins at Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt, when everyone expected them to stumble, were very un-Tottenham.",
      "But domestically, week to week, this has been a season of generational rubbish. They will almost certainly finish 16th and 17th in the Premier League, propped up only by the relegated trio. Between them, they have lost 39 of 74 league assignments, and that tally will surely rise at the weekend.",
      "For one of these clubs, the Europa League trophy will make an appearance this week and the domestic disquiet will be forgotten. For the other, they will fall at the final hurdle in a bid to, if not save their season, then at least salvage something from it.",
      "Tottenham might be seen to have the upper hand, having beaten United on three occasions this season, two of them with Ruben Amorim in the dugout. But then, United have the trophy-winning experience.",
      "How much that counts for is up for debate. Football clubs are inanimate objects after all, but just over a year ago, United were coming to the end of their worst season in years but found a way to save their best for last. Go through the wreckage of that 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, and it's the FA Cup final performance at Wembley that stands out by a mile.",
      "The contrast from the humiliating way they won the semi-final, throwing away a three-goal lead against Coventry City, surviving an unbearably tight VAR call to lose 4-3 and then winning on penalties, to the way they outplayed and outthought Manchester City is still stunning to this day.",
      "It was a performance of poise and precision, a day when the game plan worked to perfection and a reminder of the talent within the ranks. It was by some distance Ten Hag's best day in the job.",
      "In fact, it was so good that rather than being his last day in the job, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe had planned, he earned himself another chance. The challenge of lifting this team to performances of that quality on a weekly basis was beyond him, but the squad involved at Wembley agree that it was a triumph for Ten Hag last year.",
      "He got the tone of the build-up right, inspiring players through cleverly thought-out speeches and video presentations, and got his tactics spot on, outwitting Pep Guardiola. Doing the same to Ange Postecoglou might not be the same challenge, but a final is always different for a head coach, and Amorim will have to get the tone right this week.",
      "You would wonder if some of the players had been in Amorim's ear, offering titbits on what Ten Hag got so spectacularly right last May, but then the turnover in the squad is already starting. Of the XI who started the FA Cup final, only Andre Onana and Bruno Fernandes are certain to start in Bilbao.",
      "Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot would have started but for injury, and Alejandro Garnacho is still pushing to retain his place, although a spot on the bench is looking more likely. Kobbie Mainoo has dropped out of the strongest XI, and Raphael Varane, Sofyan Amrabat, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford aren't at the club now.",
      "The four subs who came on, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, could have their say. Altay Bayindir, Christian Eriksen and Amad were unused replacements.",
      "They will all remember how they managed to lift their levels for a one-off match that was crucial to deciding the fate of the season. It put a gloss on the year and also delivered European qualification.",
      "But for that unexpected and meticulously planned victory, United wouldn't even be in Bilbao. Had they lost that FA Cup final, their eighth-place finish in the Premier League wouldn't have got them into Europe.",
      "So this journey starts back to Ten Hag's perfect week. He will be nowhere to be seen this week and could have no complaints about his sacking, but if United rescue their season again and secure Champions League football, he will have played a part.",
      "How he managed to pull off victory against Manchester City at Wembley could still be instructive as to how Amorim plots the downing of Spurs at San Mames."

      "\"Again, Delap could be another young striker going to a big club, and you just don’t know what to expect with the club not in a great place at the minute.",
      "\"I always say that Manchester United should have three or four top strikers. Right now, they’ve got one who hasn’t really done it, so to sign Delap would be great, but he has to be part of two or three proper centre-forwards.\"",
      "While the arrivals of Delap and Cunha would be a very good start to United's business early in the window, it will take a massive £92.5m out of their transfer budget.",
      "So if United are to bring in an experienced forward as well as Delap, they will have to try and do so on a cut-price deal. And, as luck would have it, there are two such viable options.",
      "Jonathan David is available on a free transfer when he leaves Lille at the end of next month and he is proven at Champions League level.",
      "David scored nine goals in Europe this season and backed that up with a further 16 goals in Ligue 1. There will be a number of clubs chasing his signature but the Canada international would represent excellent business given the lack of transfer fee involved.",
      "Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic is another option United could pursue. The Serbian international has scored 15 goals this season, having scored 18 goals the season before, but he is expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "Reports in Italy have suggested the 25-year-old could be available for £35million and that would be a bargain price for a forward with proven goalscoring pedigree.",
      "While there are no guarantees United will target another forward if they sign Delap, they may be wise to take heed of Scholes' advice."

      "Amad strides towards us with his hand outstretched. We shake hands and there is a spare chair behind him.",
      "Does he want to sit down?",
      "“No, it’s okay.”",
      "Amad has stood up and been counted plenty of times for Manchester United in what is effectively his first full season. Had he not succumbed to injury in mid-February, the Sir Matt Busby player of the year statue might have had a new home away from the Fernandes residence.",
      "We are speaking on the concourse of the Stretford End, doubling as a mixed zone on United’s Uefa media day for the Europa League final. It was at that end that Amad attained cult status with his Old Trafford winner for the ages against Liverpool in the FA Cup.",
      "That still did not signal a turning point. The 22-year-old had to wait until the home defeat to Arsenal in May last year to start a meaningful match for the club he signed for in October 2020. Before then, Amad had been restricted to three starts in heavily-rotated teams under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Ruben Amorim is Amad’s fifth manager and the one who has maximised him. Ruud van Nistelrooy merits a special mention for his management of Amad during that four-game caretaker stint in the autumn.",
      "The image of Van Nistelrooy avuncularly putting an arm around Amad’s shoulder on the touchline in Istanbul sticks out. Amad had watched Erik ten Hag put Antony on ahead of him against Fenerbahce.",
      "“I need the game time to show I can play for this club,” he says. “In that moment, I was a little bit frustrated because you can understand sometimes maybe you deserve to play and you don't play. You have a little bit of frustration.",
      "“But I think now it's because the manager believes in me. He believes in my potential. I'm trying to repay his confidence every time I'm on the pitch.",
      "“Honestly, Erik helped me a lot. He was giving me a lot of advice, even when I wasn't playing. He was telling me to train very hard every time. That's the most important thing when a manager keeps telling you to train hard, even if you don't play.",
      "“So I kept training very hard, very hard. I think this season, at the beginning, I was playing a lot with him. I want to thank him again for the opportunity he gave me and I want to wish him all the best.”",
      "Amad was a one-man band in attack before he sustained an ankle injury in training in February. He was pressing Andre Onana and his left foot remained entrenched in the turf when he attempted to turn.",
      "He reflects on the two-and-a-half-month lay-off positively. Amad required surgery and “kept praying to be back before the end of the season. So this happened and now I'm happy.",
      "“I'm always positive, I'm always smiling with everyone, so that's my natural thing. That's me, that's Amad, so I always try to grow up with positive things.”",
      "His development at United was interrupted by significant injuries. A thigh strain prevented Amad from joining Feyenoord on loan in August 2021 and a knee injury sustained in the pre-season win against Arsenal in July 2023 kept him out for five months. Amad left the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on a golf buggy clutching crutches.",
      "He returned to United that summer as a cult hero at Sunderland. On Tuesday, he was back at the Stadium of Light, where he was paraded during the interval of Sunderland’s Play-off tie with Coventry City.",
      "United’s former football director John Murtough was convinced that Amad needed ten successive starts to demonstrate his qualities. During his first ten-match starting streak with Sunderland, he tallied six goals.",
      "“I believe in my potential,” Amad stresses. “I believe I can be one of the best in the world. I just have to give my best every game. That's it. But I think I believe in my potential.\"",
      "Back in the United States with United in the summer, his stock was so much higher United chose him as the player to chair a press conference. Amad’s English has improved since then and he is not as shy.",
      "His social media persona suggests he is more extroverted than his softly-spoken nature suggests. “UNITER WILL NEVER DIED,” he tweeted from the dressing room after the mother of all Old Trafford comebacks against Lyon. “Congrat manu (Ugarte) for your’re s**t goal, f**k Garna for that miss, you gaves us pain heart.”",
      "Someone asked if it was Amad’s actual account. “No, Amorim account,” he dryly replied.",
      "“I was so happy,” he laughs. “Honestly, I'm a good guy with everyone. I just posted that tweet on my X. That was funny, no?",
      "“We are really close. We are really close with Garna. Kobbie, Leny, everyone. I have good relationships with everyone. Like I said before, I have good energy, good vibes. Everyone likes to be with me.”",
      "And it’s definitely him tweeting? “Yeah, it's me, it's me. Nobody (else), it's me. It's Amad!”",
      "The Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur will be Amad’s third. He was an unused substitute in penalty shootout defeats with United in 2021 and a year later on loan at Rangers.",
      "Although his transfer to United was agreed on deadline day in October 2020, Amad arrived in Manchester in January 2021. He had a virtuoso stint in the Under 21s before Solskjaer gave him a handful of opportunities. He scored an adroit header on his third appearance against AC Milan.",
      "During the unsuccessful shootout against Villarreal in Gdansk, Amad could be seen praying. “Yes, I already lost two. I hope to win this one. I keep praying for that one. It will be really good for me, but also for the team because at the end of the day, we want some things at the end of the season.",
      "“I was on the bench. I was young. I had no experience, but it was a good experience for me to be in my first Europa League final with the team. At the team, we had great players like (Paul) Pogba and (Edinson) Cavani. It was a dream for me, honestly.",
      "“But now it's my moment. It's the moment for the club, it's the moment for the players, for everyone, for the fans because they deserve this moment. We will give everything, we will give our best to try and win this competition.”",
      "Amad has lined up on the wing and as the No.10 in his two starts since returning from injury. He seems likely to line up in the latter role in Bilbao.",
      "“Honestly, I don't have a preference,” he insists. “I'm a player who likes to play, and I'm available for every position. So if the manager prefers to put me as a right wing back, I will be more happy to play there or Number 10. I have no preference. I just want to follow the manager and his system.",
      "“The difference as right wing back (is), because you have to track back, you're a defender. You're more defender, and also you have to attack. Number 10 is more as a forward player. The difference is only this one, but I'm available for everything.”",
      "He will be denied a reunion with his former Atalanta teammate and schoolmate, Dejan Kulusevski, who underwent surgery on his patella last week. “Tottenham, even without Kulusevski, they are a really good team,” Amad cautions. “So we are not here to think about Kulusevski. But Kulusevski is a good player.",
      "“Kulusevski and Tottenham, they are really good. So I want to wish him good luck. But we are here to focus on what we can do.”",
      "Rather than be sat on the bench, Amad will be stood on the pitch for this final."

      "After Dean Henderson remained at Sheffield United for a second season-long loan, he immediately embarked on a pre-season beep test. He came first.",
      "Henderson was not lording it, though. The Sheffield United manager, Chris Wilder, was absent from the pre pre-season and Henderson was on the blower to him immediately, imploring him to get the outfield players in ship-shape ahead of the club’s first Premier League campaign in 12 years.",
      "That sounds like Henderson, a violet that does not shrink. It was in keeping with his bolshy personality that Henderson revelled in the post-match confrontation with Pep Guardiola at Wembley on Saturday. “You got your ten minutes,” he quipped, holding out both hands in case Guardiola hadn’t heard.",
      "Joe Hart has a lot to answer for. Henderson, Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale, England’s three main goalkeepers, are all kindred spirits. They are vocal, expressive, impetuous and more cocky than confident.",
      "Henderson, unlike Pickford and Ramsdale, now has a winner’s medal. His performance in the FA Cup final was career-defining. There was brilliance with the denials of Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush but also that rashness when he carried the ball out for a corner and patted it away from outside his area. He fortuitously avoided expulsion.",
      "Henderson travelled to Wembley with United for the League Cup final against Southampton in 2017. He was involved in the warm-up but back in his Paul Smith suit for the dressing room celebrations, clutching a bottle of beer. He had a taste for success, and got his hands on the trophy, but did not get a medal.",
      "Nick Cox, the head of the Manchester United academy, was quick to congratulate Henderson at the weekend. “Well played Deano. Once a red always a red,” he posted on Twitter.",
      "The United academy is quick to pat itself on the back. Their blueprint for Henderson was immaculate: loans at National League, League Two, League One, the Championship and in the Premier League before United gave consideration to installing him as their number one.",
      "When Henderson joined Stockport County in early 2016, some of his teammates in the United academy derided him for stooping to non-league football. His adviser assured him they would not have a career in the game. Henderson was shortly recalled amid injury to David de Gea and on the bench at Shrewsbury Town in the fifth round of the FA Cup.",
      "Shortly after he joined Grimsby Town later that year, Henderson informed the Grimsby Telegraph he intended to become the best goalkeeper in the world. He was 19.",
      "That fourth-tier loan stint was compelling enough for Shrewsbury Town to recruit him on loan in 2017. Henderson saved his first penalty at Wembley in the League One Play-off final.",
      "Carelessly, United had allowed Henderson to enter the final months of his first professional contract in 2018. A bump in pay and a loan to Sheffield United safeguarded their investment. Luke Shaw’s sister, Nicole, was present for Henderson’s contract signing as part of work experience with the Stellar agency. It was the first of three new deals in successive years.",
      "Jose Mourinho liked the cut of Henderson’s jib, so much so that he felt he was the best 'keeper at United when Mourinho was manager of Tottenham. United, though, were in the midst of negotiations for a new contract for De Gea in the summer of 2018. De Gea’s feeble performances for Spain at the World Cup in Russia marked the start of a gradual decline.",
      "Even after De Gea renewed in September 2019, United had a loose succession plan: let Henderson get a top-flight season under his belt, integrate him into the squad and then promote him.",
      "United did not reckon on the indecisive Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, though. Solskjaer indicated Henderson would fly to Perth for the pre-season tour after his Under 21 European Championship commitments. The only United Henderson planned on linking up with was in Sheffield.",
      "When Henderson returned to Manchester in August 2020, he was remunerated handsomely: a £100,000-a-week contract. Chelsea offered United £40million for him at one stage.",
      "Suddenly, United had two ‘keepers on a combined weekly salary of nearly £500,000. De Gea’s form suffered amid credible competition in 2020-21 and several United players thought Henderson should have replaced him after their Champions League group stage ejection by RB Leipzig.",
      "It took a pregnancy for Henderson to gain number-one status. De Gea’s partner, Edurne Garcia, was about to give birth in March 2021 and De Gea flew back to Spain for the arrival of his daughter, Yanay. Covid-19 protocols ensured De Gea would miss at least four games. Henderson was promised a six-match run: Crystal Palace, Manchester City, AC Milan at home, West Ham, Milan away and Leicester City.",
      "He kept clean sheets in four of the games and atoned for Milan defender Simon Kjaer’s late equaliser in the first leg with a decent denial of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at San Siro.",
      "De Gea was out of quarantine and available for the Milan and Leicester ties but they were in the Europa League and FA Cup and Henderson was United’s cup goalie. After the March internationals, Henderson lined up in the home fixture against Brighton and De Gea started against Granada, clear confirmation Henderson was first choice.",
      "The man-management rotation was mismanagement. De Gea earned a start in the Europa League final yet endured the worst possible penalty-shootout, conceding all 11 kicks and then having his kick saved in sudden death.",
      "The pressure got to Henderson, too. Conscious that De Gea had a reputation for staying on his line, he charged out to the edge of the 18-yard box to punch away a cross but was beaten to it by Chris Wood. The Burnley striker scored but was flagged offside.",
      "After the season ended, Solskjaer informed Henderson he would be installed as number one. Henderson, who withdrew from England’s European Championship squad with a quad injury, attended the final, soaked up the pre-match atmosphere in Boxpark Wembley, contracted Covid and was laid low for two months. De Gea remained number one, regained form and Henderson played a meagre three games in 2021-22.",
      "Henderson visited St James’ Park at the end of that season but Newcastle United lost their nerve and Burnley’s relegation made a permanent move for Nick Pope straightforward. Henderson moved to another newly-promoted team in Nottingham Forest.",
      "United banked a derisory £15m fee, rising to £20m, from Palace in August 2023. Dougie Freedman, the club’s sporting director, was in the Old Trafford directors’ box for Henderson’s last matchday squad involvement with a club he joined at the age of 14 in 2011.",
      "By that point, Henderson was so itching to leave United permanently he was loitering around the away dressing room in the tunnel.",
      "Henderson has said he regrets a piqued interview he gave to Talksport upon his loan move to Forest. Some United fans bizarrely booed him when he returned with Palace in the League Cup last season. There was a myth that he leaked information when the finger of blame could be pointed at someone else who is long since gone."

      "After Manchester United failed to win any of their opening three matches in the Europa League this season, few would have banked on them reaching the final in Bilbao.",
      "Despite taking the lead in all of their opening three league phase outings, United amassed a paltry three points from a possible nine, drawing with FC Twente (1-1), FC Porto (3-3) and Fenerbahce (1-1).",
      "The stalemate with Fenerbahce in Istanbul left United 21st in the league phase table. It also left Erik ten Hag clinging on to his job.",
      "Alongside making an underwhelming start to their Europa League campaign, United experienced a difficult start to their Premier League season. They won just three of their opening nine matches, leaving them 14th in the table.",
      "United's ninth game of their league campaign saw them beaten 2-1 by West Ham United at the London Stadium, just three days after they were pegged back by Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.",
      "That defeat to the Hammers, which was United's fourth in their opening nine league games, marked the end of the road for Ten Hag, who was dismissed the following day, just months after Ineos decided to keep him.",
      "United, almost as soon as Ten Hag had cleared his office, were on the phone to Sporting Lisbon and attempting to convince Ruben Amorim to replace him. Despite the Portuguese chief being hesitant about moving to Old Trafford mid-season, United got their man, appointing him just four days after Ten Hag had been dismissed.",
      "As part of the agreement, Amorim stayed at Sporting until the November international break, meaning Ruud van Nistelrooy was placed in temporary charge.",
      "He won three of his four games at the helm, drawing the other, and it felt as though Amorim would pick up from where the Dutchman had left off. His short spell in charge did improve the mood in and around the club. It also saw United get their Europa League campaign up and running with a 2-0 win over PAOK at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Amorim's obsession with his trademark 3-4-2-1 system meant that teething problems were to be expected at the start of his tenure. After a solid first set of results saw United draw 1-1 at Ipswich Town, beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 and brush Everton aside 4-0, United's supporters hoped the transition to Amorim's preferred system would be seamless.",
      "Amorim's warning about a storm being on its way soon came to fruition, though, and United started stumbling. The 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium was the only highlight in a forgettable December.",
      "However, despite the disappointment and frustrations of United's Premier League form, their results and performances in Europe have seen them reach the Europa League final. Wednesday night's clash with Tottenham Hotspur offers them the opportunity to salvage something from what has been a disastrous campaign.",
      "United head into the clash with Spurs boasting an unbeaten record in Europe this season, winning nine and drawing five of their 14 Europa League matches. They won each of the four league phase matches Amorim took charge of, ensuring they finished in an automatic qualification spot for the last-16.",
      "Despite being held to a draw in the first leg of their last-16 tie with Real Sociedad in Spain, they came from behind to make light work of them at Old Trafford in the second leg, winning 4-1 to seal a 5-2 aggregate triumph.",
      "Lyon were up next in the quarter-finals and United, as we all know, made hard work of that one. After the first leg finished 2-2 in France, United were heading for the exit in the second leg at Old Trafford, trailing 4-2 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate with just minutes to go.",
      "However, goals from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire meant the Europa League dream remained alive. Maguire's dramatic header was perhaps a sign that it is simply meant to be for United in this competition.",
      "Athletic Bilbao, despite looking as though they would pose the sternest test United had faced in Europe all season, were blown away in the semi-finals. United won 3-0 in Spain and 4-1 at Old Trafford to progress to the final with a commanding 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Now, of course, they are one step away from winning a European trophy and securing a place back in Europe's premier club competition next season.",
      "Despite how poor their domestic form has been this season, supporters of other clubs in this country would kill to be in the position United will find themselves in on Wednesday evening.",
      "After the way in which this Europa League campaign started and a managerial alteration needing to be made just months into the season, United deserve credit for reaching a European final. Now they need to win it."

      "However, his role as a substitute in the two games United have played since confirming their place in the final of the Europa League has felt telling.",

The former Chelsea man has gone on to start both of the following games, playing an hour against West Ham and a further 70 minutes at Stamford Bridge.",

      "Amorim is expected to drastically improve his attack next season - after an atrocious 2024/2025 campaign. Both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have both struggled in front of goal with Bruno Fernandes (19 goals) United's top-scorer and Alejandro Garnacho (11 goals) behind him.",
      "The market for attackers is expected to be as competitive as ever this summer - with teams including Arsenal, Chelsea and United all desperate for new faces. Viktor Gyokeres, Alexander Isak and Benjamin Sesko are all big names being linked with huge moves this summer, but Amorim has moved quickly to land Cunha.",
      "United received criticism for not pursuing a transfer for Cunha in January when it appeared he might have been available. A new contract was eventually signed, and United decided against the loan arrival of Mathys Tel, who joined Europa League final opponents Tottenham at the end of the window.",
      "Now, their relentless attitude is ready to pay off with United sealing his signature over the likes of Arsenal before the window has even opened. It's understood that the 25-year-old has \"accepted the project\" at Old Trafford with the final details expected to be ironed out.",
      "For Wolves, they are striking up a great deal. In December 2022, Cunha joined the club on an initial loan deal from Atletico Madrid before moving permanently for around £35million.",
      "At the time, according to transfermarkt.com, Cunha's market value was just £21million - 90 games, 33 goals and 15 assists later, his market value has done nothing but rise in two years. At the end of his first full season at Molineux (23/24), he was worth £37.8million.",
      "Now, his market value sits at £46.3million, seeing a £25.3million increase from when he first touched down in the UK. However, it is under £20million less than the figure United are expected to pay for his services, but that figure still demonstrates how much his stock has gone up since moving to the Premier League."

      "And speaking ahead of the final on Wednesday, Amorim believes United can exploit their defensive frailties.",
      "\"I think they are a team who have a lot of intensity,\" Amorim told MUTV.",
      "\"They have a really strong identity, they play in the same way and you can see it. They score a lot of goals but they also suffer because they want to score every time.",
      "\"We know Spurs, they know our team and we also have a strong identity so it is going to be a good game.\"",

      "Manchester United have been handed a transfer bombshell after Portuguese media reports suggested on Monday that they have lost the race for Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The Swedish striker has been on the radar of United since November when Ineos poached his manager in Lisbon, Ruben Amorim. A clear problem for United this season has been their lack of goals with both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee missing as reliable threats.",
      "Gyokeres has bagged a whopping 96 goals for Sporting this season and the fact he is familiar with the 3-4-2-1 system made it appear as though a transfer would be a match made in heaven for United. However, Arsenal have also been heavily linked with his services having admired him for longer than the Reds.",
      "Like United, the Gunners have also struggled without a regular centre-forward presence at the top of the pitch. While their season has been more impressive than the Reds', Mikel Arteta's side are likely wanting to address that position as a priority.",
      "According to Portuguese newspaper O Jogo, that is exactly what they have done. Their front page leads with an image of Gyokeres celebrating after winning the Liga Portugal this weekend.",
      "One of the headlines next to his name reads: \"Swede on his way to Arsenal.\" It is claimed that a £58.9m agreement has been reached between Sporting and the Gunners and it is only a matter of time before the transfer is made official.",
      "If true, United will be looking to reassess their options heading into the summer transfer window. MEN Sport understands that Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is a top target for United this summer thanks in part to his much lower release clause of £30m.",
      "It is also believed that Delap's proven ability in the Premier League - as shown with 12 goals for relegated Ipswich - and his age are also seen as positives. Versatile forward Matheus Cunha is also seen as a top target for United and has a £62.5m release clause in his Wolverhampton Wanderers contract."

      "Victor Lindelof started against Villarreal in the 2021 Europa League final in Gdansk and he could be given an unlikely shot at redemption in the competition against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Lindelof started against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and is likely to retain his starting role for United's biggest game of the season due to Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro having injuries.",
      "United will leave it late to decide on the fitness of De Ligt and Yoro. But even if either of the pair are given the green light to make the squad in Bilbao, they might not be fit enough to start and Lindelof is waiting in the wings.",
      "Yoro recently left Old Trafford without a protective boot after facing West Ham, which was seen as a positive sign, although De Ligt's situation just a few weeks earlier shows that might not necessarily mean good news.",
      "The bright side is that Yoro was spotted going into the gym at Carrington to do his own individual work earlier in the week, and Amorim initially said that he thought his issue was \"small.\"",
      "Yoro has improved each month during his debut season in Manchester and would be a nailed-on starter against Tottenham if he's fit enough to play. That remains to be seen, though.",
      "Lindelof is set to leave United upon the expiry of his contract at the end of the season. His deal expires officially on June 30 and starting him in the Europa League would not be ideal.",

      "Lindelof was supposed to leave Old Trafford last summer, but he sustained an injury in pre-season, which blocked his exit, and he returned to full training at Carrington in late September.",
      "The 30-year-old would have expected to be a peripheral squad member throughout this campaign, however, he has been needed to contribute in a handful of big games due to injuries.",
      "Lindelof has bags of experience and should be capable of filling in on the big stage, despite his contract situation. He arrived at United in the summer of 2017 and Luke Shaw is the only player in the dressing room who has been at the club for longer.",
      "This season was supposed to be low-key for Lindelof, but he has suddenly become important again and it's pretty staggering that he could start in another Europa League final for United.",
      "Lindelof might also be joined by Shaw in the back-three alongside Harry Maguire. Those three players started at Stamford Bridge and all played important roles during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure.",
      "Solskjaer oversaw the 2021 Europa League final against Villarreal. Maguire's absence in that final due to injury was a huge blow, but Lindelof and Shaw started in the defeat to the Spaniards on penalties.",
      "Ayden Heaven returned to the squad against Chelsea and came on from the bench with 10 minutes remaining. Tyler Fredricson is another option, but they could obviously not be thrown in.",
      "Amorim's best defensive options for the final could be three players who Solskjaer loved."

      "But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing left to sort out in these closing days of the 2025/26 season. Here are literally 10 things of varying levels of importance that are still to be decided.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Champions League qualifiers\nSure, Liverpool have got the league wrapped up. And yes, Arsenal are going to be in the Champions League having successfully now (barring mathematical absurdities) avoided the ‘third in a two-horse race’ whimsy.",
      "But the rest? Up in the air.",
      "We do know the top five will all qualify for the Champions League this year, but which three of Newcastle, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Man City and Nottingham Forest make it alongside Liverpool and Arsenal remains very much TBC.",
      "And if Man City don’t beat Bournemouth tonight then we have the very delicious prospect of the five teams scrapping over third to seventh going into the final day separated by a single point.",
      "It’s a better climax to the season than we thought we were getting a few weeks ago, anyway.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Europa League qualifiers\nAnd if we don’t know who all the Champions League qualifiers are, then we obviously can’t know the Europa League qualifiers either, can we? One of those who misses out on the Big Cup are joining FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the Europa League, which is so easy to win even Spurs or Man United can do it.",
      "Crystal Palace London-bussing their way to a second trophy so soon after their first is a fun prospect, and there’s a very plausible chance that they too could do so in a London-Manchester final to match this year’s, against the team they’ve just beaten at Wembley. Wouldn’t that be fun?",
      "",
      "Next year’s Conference League qualifier\nOr even if there’s going to be one at all. It’s possible England won’t even have a team in next year’s Conference. We don’t pretend to understand the science of it but if Chelsea finish sixth and Newcastle don’t finish seventh and then Chelsea win the Conference League then we end up with six English teams in the Champions League and three in the Europa League! And none at all in the Conference! Because reasons!",
      "",
      "Golden Glove: Raya v Sels\nAlexander Isak’s untimely injury has denied us the chance to pretend the Golden Boot is still up for grabs this season, with a malfunctioning Erling Haaland needing seven goals in two games to pull level with long-time clear leader Mo Salah atop the charts. It’s not happening, is it?",
      "But Isak’s absence against Arsenal may well have helped gives us a neck-and-neck Golden Glove fight, because David Raya’s hard-won clean sheet against Newcastle – one that required him to make five saves in the first 20 minutes as Newcastle started much the brighter – allowed him to pull level on 13 clean sheets with Matz Sels.",
      "Sels looked like moving to 14 for most of Sunday afternoon’s game at the London Stadium, but while Jarrod Bowen’s late goal proved to be nothing more than consolation nerve-jangler for the result, it has left this fight going down to the wire neck and neck.",
      "And if you were a betting man you’d have to now favour Raya, with Arsenal up against Southampton on the final day and Sels facing the altogether trickier task of keeping out Chelsea.",
      "",
      "The match that will determine once and for all which club is the greatest on earth: Tottenham or Manchester United\nWe know England will have six teams in next season’s Champions League. We know who two of them are. We know the other three will be some flavour of competent. And then there’s the piss-boiling sixth, which is going to be one of the two stupidest teams in the league at this time because one of them is going to win the Europa League.",
      "A lot of people are unhappy about this. Arsene Wenger is so cross about it all that he’s briefly stopped trying to destroy football entirely with his batsh*t non-solution to toenail offsides. People who have absolutely no problem with the team that finishes fifth in the Premier League being in the Champions League are foaming at the mouth at the very idea of Spurs being there, people presumably in for the shock of their lives when they find out how Spurs qualified for the Europa League in the first place.",
      "We have a strong inkling about how Wednesday night will pan out based on years of evidence that tells us two things: one, Manchester United can always pinch a trophy no matter how abject they appear to be, but more importantly two, the joke is and always must be on Spurs.",
      "‘Only Spurs’ is an overused expression in these pages but there really is no other club quite like them and it really does feel like Only Spurs could carve out a situation where this season is either a) their best season in 41 years or b) their worst season in 48 years, with there being absolutely no middle ground and the whole thing settled by one game in Bilbao.",
      "And again, recent history tells you one of those options instinctively feels far more likely. But at the same time United are simply so bad that even the apparent formality of beating Spurs in a final cannot be taken for granted.",
      "What we do know for absolute certain is that by 11pm on Wednesday night X-formerly-Twitter will be awash with cry-laughing emojis and people saying ‘Can’t believe these are in the Champions League’. The loser is going to get absolutely cooked and the winner is going to boil more p*ss than has ever been boiled before.",
      "Honestly, we can’t wait.",
      "",
      "Can Antony win two European titles in one season?\nThe Europa League final is the most obvious example of how no matter what happens everyone wins yet also somehow everyone loses, but let’s not forget the humble Europa Conference League final because that is not without its charms.",
      "If Chelsea have been kind enough to finish seventh in the Premier League, then them winning it as everyone has just assumed all season long is what will happen means that England will have 10 teams in Europe next season and that’s just plain nutty.",
      "But if Real Betis win it on the back of a Man United win in the Europa League then Antony will have won more European trophies in one season than Arsenal have in their entire existence, and you have to say that’s magnificent.",
      "",
      "The race for eighth\nThis is the kind of thing we should all be able to get behind: a final-day barney for one place that probably won’t matter. And even if Chelsea do the necessary on the final day to make eighth potentially matter, it won’t be until three days later and the Conference final that we actually know for sure.",
      "This is Barclays heritage. Brighton are in pole position now after beating unapologetically beach-based flip-flop-sporting cigar-puffing Liverpool on Monday night, knowing that a final-day victory at Tottenham – who are either going to be too happy or too sad to care, surely – will be enough even if Bournemouth win both their remaining games.",
      "Brentford are still in the mix as well, but that Brighton win over Liverpool has taken Fulham out of the equation.",
      "",
      "The race for 17th\nWest Ham, bless them, have managed to stay involved in this dignity-shedding contest despite not having the excuse of a Europa League final to possibly get them out of jail, but they face Ipswich on the final day and thus this surely will come down to a fight between the stoppable force of Manchester United and the movable object of Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Sure, it’s perhaps not the most significant contest between the two that remains to be played out this season but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t all just stop and take a moment to marvel at what we’re actually saying here. Spurs. Man United. Seventeenth place.",
      "One way or another we can’t imagine either of them getting anything out of Sunday’s final game after what will for both teams whatever happens be the season-defining emotional extreme of Wednesday night.",
      "And in any case both find themselves up against demonstrably superior teams who actually have something to play for in the league, a quaint concept Spurs and United abandoned months ago. United play Villa, still in the Champions League hunt, while Spurs host a Brighton side in pole position for the uncomfortably Chelsea-dependent but nevertheless potentially significant eighth place.",
      "If we’re being very greedy indeed, we do want whoever wins the Europa League to finish 17th because it is slightly funnier than a Champions League qualifier finishing 16th even though that is already very funny indeed.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace’s maiden half-century\nSome might argue that Crystal Palace have already achieved the biggest thing they’ll do this season having won the FA Cup and thus the first major title of their entire history. To that we say tish and fipsy because that will pale into rank insignificance if they can secure a 50th point for the first time ever in any Premier League season.",
      "They are currently on 49 points with two games to go, the second of which is now set to be a rare old occasion at Anfield in which everyone is just having a big old party as Liverpool collect their Premier League trophy and Palace revel in their new-found status as trophy winners.",
      "It’s one of the games we’re most looking forward to on the final day purely because such a vibe is so rare in your toxic, tribal, online modern football warfare. A game where everyone in the stadium will just be having a lovely old time celebrating a successful season. ‘Snice.",
      "We’re thinking double guards of honour. We’re thinking both teams cavorting about with their trophies. We’re thinking everyone celebrating a late Eberechi Eze equaliser that takes Palace to the promised land of 50 points. We want to go to there.",
      "",
      "The sacrificial play-off winner\nWe did genuinely almost forget this one, which is slightly embarrassing but also revealing of how the land now lies for teams promoted from the Championship.",
      "But in terms of formalising things we don’t yet know about this season, we do need to stop and consider that we don’t yet in fact know the full line-up for next season’s Premier League until it is confirmed which poor sods are setting themselves up for a season of Derby-bothering ritual humiliation.",
      "It’s going to be Sheffield United or Sunderland, so it’s going to be a big club that in days gone by you would absolutely think had every chance of giving survival a red-hot crack. Now you assume they’re doomed unless they decide to just break all the rules and accept a points penalty in their second season is probably worth the risk if they’ve already managed to stay up at the expense of, oh, let’s say, West Ham.",
      "More likely, though: the winner of Football’s Richest Game instead condemns themselves to a season of being patronised very nearly as much as we’ve just done here while desperately scrambling to cobble 20 points together before dropping back down to the second tier to try and do it all again."

      "This was the weekend that hands Ed top billing…\nI still don’t have my voice back from Saturday yet. I wasn’t at Wembley, I couldn’t afford it and anyway, there are some times when it’s better to be in the comfort of your own home.",
      "* It’s weird, really. The more you allow yourself to dream that it might happen, the less likely it seems that it will actually happen. So you start playing down your chances, but the more you talk up your opposition the more you wonder if maybe, just maybe, there’s a chance.",
      "* As with their previous trip to the FA Cup Final, Crystal Palace were led by a very self-confident manager. The difference is that this time, when Oliver Glasner reacted to losing 5-2 to Manchester City by telling Pep Guardiola that if he used that system again, he would get beaten, you believed him.",
      "Taking Palace to the FA Cup Final and high self-confidence are where the comparisons between Glasner and one of his predecessors, Alan Pardew, begin and end. It was nice to see that Palace had invited some former managers along to Wembley: we’re all a bit better for seeing Steve Coppell, Alan Smith and Roy Hodgson on good form, and in its own way, it was telling that there was no sign of Pardew.",
      "* The other big difference between 2016 and 2025 was Palace’s form heading into the game. In 2016, between their win in the third round and defeat in the final, they took just 11 points (two wins, five draws) from 19 games – half a season! In hindsight it’s clear to see Pardew spent the day before the game negotiating a new contract, protecting himself from a justifiable sacking, instead of focussing on the most important matter.",
      "In contrast, Glasner’s 2025 side played 16 league games between the third round and the final, taking 28 points (eight wins, four draws) in that time. Just as well they had a terrible start to the season to give everyone else a chance because 1.75 points per game over the course of an entire season would put them in the European places.",
      "* This year’s Final did not take very long to establish its pattern: Manchester City dominating possession, Crystal Palace camped on the edge of their own penalty area. City had an early chance but couldn’t take it, and then the moment of magic happened. Palace gained possession and scored what has been one of their trademark goals this season. A long ball from Chris Richards on the byline found Jean-Philippe Mateta, who held the ball up on half way and exchanged passes with a midfielder (in this case Daichi Kamada) and released Daniel Muñoz down the right, where he crossed for Eberechi Eze to fire home following a Frank Lampard-esque late run.",
      "* It’s been a comparatively tough season for City, and at times Guardiola has looked a little exposed. City’s struggles for form were attributed to Rodri’s absence, and while any team would miss a player that good and that important to their system, it wasn’t the best look for Guardiola’s standing as a tactical mastermind that he had neither an alternative to Rodri in that role, nor an alternative system to compensate for their absent star. On Saturday, they huffed and puffed but largely played in the same pattern for the entire game, and paid the price for their predictability.",
      "The hardest part to understand is why, knowing how dangerous Palace are down their right, City still insisted on moving their left-back into the midfield, giving Muñoz lots of space behind to run into. What were we saying earlier about managers coming undone by overconfidence?",
      "* One time they did try something a bit different led to the most controversial moment of the game. A long ball over the top saw Erling Haaland one on one with Dean Henderson, and the Palace keeper appeared to handle the ball outside his area. I don’t think it was a red card offence, despite the doublespeak of virtually every pundit asked about it (“Haaland hasn’t scored in five games at Wembley/of course it’s a goal scoring opportunity, it’s Haaland”), because there are two levels of mitigation. First, there is a defender racing back towards the goal who can get into position to make a block while Haaland is going round Henderson. Second, Henderson’s feet are well inside his area when he reaches across the line and handles the ball – in no way was it a cynical play but it was a breach of the rules. Had the officials decide to show Henderson a yellow card in real time and award City a free kick, I don’t think there would have been many complaints from either side.",
      "* That said, reducing Palace to 10 men would not have changed the game much, because they would have still been camped on the edge of their area. And while we’re dealing with hypotheticals, there was more than a suspicion of evening up about the penalty awarded to City. The ball was running out of play, Tyrick Mitchell appeared to get a toe on it and Bernardo Silva was clearly looking for contact, but nonetheless, a penalty was awarded and then saved.",
      "Haaland held the ball while the referee was sorting out the other players, before handing it over to Omar Marmoush to take the kick. This is something that teams do so that any mind games or abuse are absorbed by a fall guy rather than the taker, and yet, not a single Palace player went anywhere near either of the City forwards. Once again, City didn’t adapt their scripted plan to what the opposition were doing, and suffered for it. It wasn’t a particularly great penalty, but Henderson made a superb double save from it and the rebound, for the sort of moment where Palace fans dare to start believing.",
      "* The penalty itself was one of seven fouls committed all game by Glasner’s team, the same number as City conceded, but it’s a testament to the Palace team’s discipline that the only yellow card any of them collected was when Henderson was cautioned for time wasting in stoppage time. In contrast, City’s frustrations got the better of them when they picked up five yellow cards. Defending that intensely for that long is incredibly tough, but to a man they performed their job admirably, it was a masterclass in how to protect a lead.",
      "* The oldest person in the world will turn 116 years old this year. They were born four years after Crystal Palace were formed and, like us, just witnessed them winning a major trophy for the first time. All the generations of Palace fans who lived and died without seeing this, all those gone too soon. This is for them as much as it is for us. There is a deep connection between club and community, the players know how much it all means to the fans, and the fans celebrate each other. The tifo before the game, of the two boys and their father (who subsequently passed away) celebrating Darren Ambrose’s goal against Manchester United in 2009, a beautiful image summing up just how much it all means.",

This feels as important in terms of pressure & outcome as the 2008 CL finals, where the pressure to win was immense! In no way am I comparing the status of winning the two, but just the pressure on a team to win. A Europa win is the difference between getting a Gyokeres or Mateta, 100 million or 0 million, back in the elite or a has-been club. It’s as do or die as it can be, and honestly, I don’t see us winning it.",
      "We haven’t defeated any non relegated English team other than Fulham via a deflected Martinez goal this year. Spurs have trashed us thrice. We are unable to score, unable to defend & unable to pass the ball. In all likelihood, this will be a one sided Spurs trashing. Unless Spurs forget to show up, I cannot see any way United win this. I am hoping & praying that we somehow get our sh*t together, but every match I watch makes it more painfully obvious that we are nowhere near the elite level. But winning the Europa changes everything. it would be close to a 3 year leap we take in our growth. It’s the biggest and best shortcut we have, it’s a jackpot, an undeserved jackpot. Here is to hoping against all logic that United & Amorim can pull off a masterclass in the finals.",
      "On the other hand, I am glad the opponents are Spurs. If there is one team I don’t mind winning this trophy, it’s poor Spurs. They really need to win something in life, and this could be a good booster for them and also cement their place as the 2nd biggest London club AFTER Crystal Palace for the 24/25 season only. So yeah, if Spurs win, it’s ok. I will be happy for them after a few days and wish them the best. Or maybe that’s just what I am telling myself in anticipation of a loss.",

      "However, sacking ANOTHER manager will not magically wave away the club’s fundamental issues. It certainly won’t patch up the financial issues that have arisen from years of poor transfer and wage decisions, which led to hundreds of redundancies from arguably the last set of employees who deserve to be let go. It definitely won’t create the atmosphere of clarity you suggest it will, a new set of ideas, a new range of tactics, and so on.",
      "The “good player” trap is one that many United fans and people working in the media either keep falling for or ignore the true context of the situation to push a narrative. Antony and Rashford always showed potential to perform at the levels they have after leaving on loan, but how often did they show that level before leaving? Yes, anyone would probably present an upgrade to Hojlund at this moment, but the team underperformed with them there, and sometimes their body language made it seem like it was everyone’s fault but theirs.",
      "I do believe we, as United (the Manchester variety, apologies Newcastle and West Ham fans) fans, need to readjust our expectations. The league is super rich, which makes it super competitive, and we have spent the better part of 2 decades buying players who cannot compete. We need to take a deep breath, allow the current manager to sign at least 5 players and see what the performances and results are like then.",
      "There are positives to be taken from some of the games, even if the results do not suggest this. Let’s take our results-based glasses off and accept that we will not be good for a while, back the manager and (some) of the squad and keep our fingers crossed that the new recruitment and data setup will prevent us from signing £600m worth of Amorim’s old mates.\nEmmanuel, Abuja",

      "Although they are due to meet in the final of the Europa League this week, there isn’t another football club on the continent who’d look to either Manchester United or Tottenham as an idealised vision for a successful – even functional – football team.",
      "Managers Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou both sit on shaky ground and the haphazard, spaff-money-up-the-wall recruitment policies the two clubs have diligently adhered to in recent seasons has left them light years behind the Premier League’s best sides in terms of squad quality.",
      "Yet for all their incompetence on the field and in the transfer market, United and Spurs are, in fact, trailblazers when it comes to a matter that football fans consider of increasingly great importance.",
      "According to a new study commissioned by climate-change charity Pledgeball in partnership with Champions League sponsors Mastercard, a staggering 81% of football fans want their clubs to take more action when it comes to combatting the impact of global warming and instituting policies to drive sustainability.",
      "A survey conducted from a sample of 1,628 football supporters – made up of online questionnaire respondents, mailing list subscribers and in-person interviews with fans at last year’s Champions League final – found that 82% of football followers are concerned about climate change, in addition to the whopping percentage of fans who wish their teams would do more to fight it.",
      "And while United and Spurs fans can rightly feel aggrieved about so many aspects of how their clubs are run, this is one area in which they are leading the way.",
      "Or, rather, in United’s case it’s an area in which they intend to raise the bar.",
      "The Red Devils recently announced ambitious plans for a new stadium to replace Old Trafford. When designs for the 100,000-seater arena were unveiled, they were greeted with ridicule for their striking resemblance to a circus top – a fitting home for what has been a clown show of a team for much of the past decade.",
      "But within the plans there were details of how the new stadium will set high standards for sustainability.",
      "The tent-like roof structure was the most eye-catching and divisive element of the 20-time champions’ as yet unnamed next home. (New Trafford? New Old Trafford? Let’s face it, it’ll more likely end up being called the Crypto.ai Megabowl or something.)",
      "The so-called ‘umbrella roof’, however, will be equipped with solar panels and a rain-harvesting system to reduce the stadium’s reliance on non-renewable energy sources. The energy efficiency of the arena has been devised in order to align with Manchester’s 2038 carbon-neutral target.",
      "“The stadium is contained by a vast umbrella, harvesting energy and rainwater, and sheltering a new public plaza that is twice the size of Trafalgar Square,” said Lord Norman Foster, founder and executive chairman of Foster + Partners, the firm commissioned to come up with the design.",
      "“The outward-looking stadium will be the beating heart of a new sustainable district, which is completely walkable, served by public transport, and endowed by nature. It is a mixed-use miniature city of the future – driving a new wave of growth and creating a global destination that Mancunians can be proud of.”",
      "And while United are talking a good game about the sustainability of their new stadium, Tottenham are very much walking the walk.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (they still haven’t found a buyer for those delicious naming rights) opened in 2019 and set a new standard for what’s possible when it comes to the sustainability of mega-arenas.",
      "It is powered by 100% renewable electricity, sends zero waste to landfill and has eschewed single-use plastic water bottles in favour of recyclable cartons.",
      "When the stadium was freshly finished, videos of their ingenious bottom-filling beer cups went viral. Well, not only are those space-age cups impressive for how rapidly and smoothly they fill, they are also part of a reusable beer cup scheme in operation at the ground.",
      "It’s not just the drinks that are green at Spurs, either. The club commits to sourcing all food produce from within a 60-mile radius of their north London home, with an extensive plant-based offering, too.",
      "All of this is with the aim of achieving net zero carbon neutrality as a club by 2040, a target towards with Tottenham claim to be on track.",
      "So while for one of these clubs, Europa League success will only paper over the chasms of incompetence that have been on full display for several years on the pitch, there’s good work being done in and around their stadiums.",

      "The Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur highlights a Big Midweek for Heung-min Son and Pep Guardiola.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester United\nSomehow, this is where we’re at. The teams 16th and 17th in the Premier League have stumbled into the Europa League final, which takes place in Bilbao on Wednesday evening. To hammer home just how s**t these two have been domestically: both have one win in their last 10 league games – that’s fewer than Leicester City, and the same as Ipswich Town.",
      "That both are woefully out of form actually adds to the spectacle. Football, like boxing, is often at its best when it’s messy. The higher the quality, the more cagey it gets. The worse and more vulnerable the fighters, the more likely someone gets sparked. In other words: chaos incoming.",
      "These two have already met three times this season. Spurs have won all three, with an aggregate score of 8-3. So obviously, Manchester United will win. That’s how football works, innit? Also, it’s Spurs. In a final.",
      "For all the stick United have received post-Sir Alex Ferguson, they’ve actually won two cup finals in the last two seasons, and if you include the Community Shield and UEFA Super Cup, they’ve gone seven for 12 in finals since 2013. Spurs in that time have lost three out of three finals and have only won one trophy in the 21st century.",
      "We all know Spurs’ pot-dodging ways, but Ange Postecoglou insisted he wins things in second seasons. It would be the least Spursy thing ever for him to deliver on that promise, and it would allow him to leave with his head held high. Lose, and it’s hard to see him managing in the Premier League again. He needs this, and Spurs need this, to end a ridiculous 17-year trophy drought.",
      "Ruben Amorim, meanwhile, is expected to be in the Old Trafford dug-out next season, regardless of the result. But he needs this too, for the Champions League football, and the money that comes with it, to paper over the cracks of United’s worst-ever Premier League finish.",
      "It’s hard to predict the score – but we’re willing to stick our necks out and predict plenty of chaos, mistakes, and entertainment.",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Crystal Palace\nThere’s a tiny winy chance that Crystal Palace will still be hungover or half-p*ssed for Tuesday’s Premier League clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers – and who could blame them? On Saturday, they made history by winning their first-ever major trophy, and now return home to a boisterous, euphoric Selhurst Park.",
      "It promises to be a carnival atmosphere, and you’d hope that only fuels the fire for Oliver Glasner’s side to put on a show for a fanbase still floating somewhere above south London. With European football already secured, and the pressure off, Palace can play with complete freedom – and that’s a terrifying prospect for any opponent.",
      "Wolves have nothing left to play for beyond the moral victory of finishing above Manchester United and Spurs – which, let’s be honest, would be a laugh but hardly season-defining. They’ve also lost two on the bounce without scoring, and this might not be the occasion to turn things around.",
      "Momentum has the potential to be everything and Palace are absolutely riding the wave",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Pep Guardiola\nSo, Pep Guardiola overthought another final. Of course he did. As a result, Manchester City have finished FA Cup runners-up two years in a row. Now that a trophyless season is confirmed, attention turns back to the Premier League – where City have a big job to do.",
      "Bournemouth come to the Etihad to face what you’d assume will be a motivated City side, hell-bent on righting their Wembley wrongs with an emphatic performance. A win would at least help secure Champions League qualification, which is still not a done deal.",
      "On the same weekend they lost to Crystal Palace, all of their top-five rivals – except Newcastle United – won. And it was Arsenal who beat them, ensuring City now need a miraculous goal swing and for the Gunners to lose to actual Southampton on the final day to sneak second place.",
      "That particular target – and the hilarious prospect of Arsenal finishing third in a two-horse race behind City again – can be forgotten. The focus for Guardiola now is to get a reaction.",
      "Expect changes. To what extent, who knows? Matheus Nunes at right-back wouldn’t be a surprise. Ilkay Gundogan or Nico Gonzalez could come in to add some midfield steel, and Kevin De Bruyne will surely keep his place after being the only City player to show up at Wembley.",
      "Guardiola looked rattled after being out-tacticed by Oliver Glasner, though he did take time to congratulate Palace on their first major trophy in 119 years. But a Dean Henderson masterclass, plus a slice of luck, clearly p**sed Pep off – and honestly, who could blame him after the Palace goalkeeper got away with a red card?",
      "That’s history now. The only priority is preparing his side for a must-win game. Fail to beat Bournemouth, and suddenly that final-day trip to Fulham starts to look a lot more sticky.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Heung-min Son\nSeveral Spurs players have the chance to win their first major trophy on Wednesday – and Heung-min Son is one of them. That might come as a surprise, considering his world-class ability over much of the last decade, but it makes perfect sense: he’s spent 11 years at Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "And no, we’re not counting the Asian Games he won with South Korea’s Under-23s at the age of 26. He got military exemption for that – and that’s plenty, Clive.",
      "It’s remarkable that a player of Son’s calibre has won diddly squat in his club career, and even more so that he’s stayed at Spurs for so long. But a win against Manchester United would make that loyalty worth it.",
      "Son needs this – to justify his decision to stay, and to give his CV something it badly lacks. But right now, Spurs need him more than ever. In a season full of underwhelming performances, Postecoglou is without his two main playmakers in Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison, meaning much of the creative burden now falls on the South Korean.",
      "It’s been a disappointing campaign for both player and club – but there’s hope that Son’s superstar quality could finally shine through to deliver Spurs’ first major trophy since 2008.",

      "It is the time in the season to start thinking about Premier League prize money. Arsenal missed out on not only the title but a record payout last campaign.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was £3.1m per position in 2022/23 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "Burnley were shown on the fewest occasions and received £9.3m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",
      "Spurs in 5th (£164.6m) were paid more overall than Villa in 4th (£162.4m), while 8th-placed Manchester United (£156.2m) took home more than 7th-placed Newcastle (£154.7m).",

      "Gary Neville insists it’s too early to judge both Ruben Amorim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe despite their poor starts to life at Manchester United.",
      "The Red Devils have the chance of claiming a trophy with the Europa League final to come on Wednesday against Tottenham, with victory also seeing them qualify for the Champions League next season.",
      "But Amorim has admitted this may be “the worst” United team in history, with his side currently 16th in the Premier League having lost 18 of their 37 games this season.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim sack calls despite ‘bonkers’ trophy chance for Man Utd",
      "There have been suggestions Amorim could be sacked or even resign at the end of the season, but Neville insists he needs time to “embed” and picked the six players required as a “minimum” this summer.",
      "“What they need to do now is to create some stability,” Neville told The Athletic. “There has been a lot of instability off the pitch in respect of the non-playing staff and there has been a lot of instability on the pitch with the changes of manager and changes to the squad. That has got to stop at some point and they’ve got to embed in Ruben’s team, let them develop.",
      "“I think this time next year we’ll know a lot more, when we see whether Ruben can build a successful team. Christmas next year we’ll know a lot more, because I think Ruben needs to get that second transfer window.",
      "“He needs a proper pre-season with the team to embed this system and this style of play. We’ll know a lot more in October, November, December when I’m sure they’ll be winning more matches than they are now.",
      "“It needs a big overhaul in the summer. Five or six players minimum to be able to change the direction of how he wants to play. There’s at least two forwards, a central midfield player, definitely two wing backs and another centre-back. They need six players minimum.",
      "“Ruben has been very good at identifying the players he wants out of the club; that’s really clear to everybody. The club’s job now is to get them out and get replacements in that he likes and wants in his team.”",
      "Ratcliffe has also endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford having taken control of football operations a little over a year ago.",
      "The British billionaire has made at least 17 mistakes in that time having embarked on a significant cost-cutting regime.",
      "And while Neville admits “two or three things have not gone well”, like Amorim, he believes it’s too early to judge the part-owner.",
      "“There’s no doubt that in the first 12 months of his ownership, there are two or three things he would have done differently,” Neville explains. “The reality is it’s such a big club, there is such a lot to do and there was so much wrong with it when he came in, I think he has got to be given some time to be able to develop a successful football club again.",
      "“It hasn’t been successful at the levels that United would want, winning Premier League titles and Champions Leagues, for 10 years — so it is a transition period where the new ownership are building new foundations.",
      "“I always say it takes three years, four years to be able to embed something and he’s only 12 months in, so we need to give him time.",
      "“They’re very much in the embryonic stages of a stadium project, a training ground project and building a new team on the pitch. To say 12 months in whether it’s going to be a failure or success is too difficult.",
      "“There is two or three things that have not gone very well and been quite unpopular, but there are also massive changes that needed to occur.",
      "“When you’re going into a club that basically has had sustained failure for 10 years and has recruited badly, you’re going to upset things along the way. You might make some decisions that ultimately are with a blunt tool, but the reality is change was required. It definitely was required.”",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Manchester United are ‘closing in’ on their first summer signing ahead of next season.",
      "Man Utd’s board have a huge job on their hands this summer, with significant changes required to ensure they improve on their shambolic 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The Red Devils could still finish 17th in the Premier League, while they also came up short in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",
      "Despite this, a massive positive could still come from this season as Ruben Amorim’s side face Spurs in the Europa League final on Wednesday night, with the trophy, Champions League football and an injection of cash up for grabs.",
      "United desperately need this prize money as it’s been widely reported that INEOS are working with a restricted budget and could have to sell to buy.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd appear to have the financial muscle to complete one or two deals in the early stages of the summer window, with eyes on Wolves standout Matheus Cunha.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim sack calls despite ‘bonkers’ trophy chance for Man Utd",
      "The Brazil international features in our Premier League team of the season as he’s shone in a struggling Wolves side, grabbing 15 goals and six assists in the league.",
      "Cunha would fit perfectly into Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation and it’s been widely reported that he is among Man Utd’s top targets.",
      "Speculation regarding a possible move to Man Utd has rumbled on longer than some suspected, but Romano reassured their supporters over the weekend.",
      "“Relax a bit on this one in the sense that, yes, probably there was a feeling two, three weeks ago that this deal could happen in a few days, but it always takes time to prepare a contract, to agree on the salary, to speak with the agent, then to agree with Wolves on the payment terms for the £62.5m release clause,” Romano revealed.",
      "“They need to find an agreement on the payment terms. Man Utd are working on it. Man Utd have very good connection with Cunha, with his agents. It’s a very positive conversation. Ruben Amorim appreciates Cunha, and Cunha knows that very well.",
      "“Man Utd remain very confident. Despite the rumours about other clubs – there’s always been a lot of interest in Cunha – Man Utd are the clear favourites. We expect Man Utd to advance on this one in the next days.",
      "“From what I always heard, it’s not about the Champions League football or not, winning the Europa League or not. It’s not about that. Cunha is keen on the move to United. It’s just about completing the contract agreement.”",
      "Now, Romano has provided a fresh update, claiming Man Utd are ‘closing in’ on Wolves’ versatile attacker.",
      "He tweeted: “Manchester United are now closing in on Matheus Cunha deal!",
      "“The Brazilian has accepted the project as agreement on personal terms is now being finalised, almost done.",
      "“Final details to sort between all parties involved… and then, here we go.”",
      "Carragher believes Cunha is the “perfect” fit for Amorim’s Man Utd but reckons his arrival could push one Red Devils star out. “It’s certainly not good news”.",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has ‘approved’ a ‘perfect player’ for Manchester United, who have been ‘set’ a ‘hefty’ demand for another target.",
      "Absolutely not but we all get to put Liverpool and Man Utd in the same headline so whoop-de-doo.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has named the “clear favourites” to sign Manchester United target Matheus Cunha amid Arsenal’s ‘late’ hijack attempt.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s anticipated move to Manchester United is edging closer, though the deal could reportedly hit a total of €80million (£67.2million).",
      "Ex-Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has picked out two ideal signings for his former club, who need “ten” additions to get back on track."

David Moyes sensed things “coming back together” after “a real break-up” between the fans, the players, the owners and the club and it felt as though Goodison, its memories and what it meant to a great many people provided the path to overdue conciliation.",

      "It had to be Moyes in the dugout. It had to be Seamus Coleman wearing the captain’s armband, and it probably had to be him being substituted after 18 minutes because Everton will always be at least a little bit Everton.",
      "But as the manager said, a club which “looked broken and felt broken doesn’t feel like that anymore”. He is as responsible for that shift as anyone and there is no more fitting candidate to lead Everton into a new era than the one who best defined the peak of their last.",

      "The frustration that even Champions League qualification will not offset the need to make at least one significant sale is understandable.

When Chelsea needed inspiration, their captain provided it.",

      "Arsenal\nThe overwhelming chances are that they would have managed to overcome the final hurdle of Southampton at St Mary’s to secure Champions League qualification, but the idea of Arsenal spiralling out of control and those places a few days after either Spurs or Manchester United bumbled their way into the competition would have been irresistible.",
      "Instead, a preview of the sort of thing they must do more frequently next season: turn just half of those 14 draws into wins and it should ordinarily be enough to land Arsenal in Mikel Arteta’s right place, right time dreamland.",
      "It has been a disappointing end to the season but those post-PSG games set up a fall the Arsenal of old would absolutely have taken. The comeback point against Liverpool and scrappy win over Newcastle has averted potential disaster and proved that this manager and these players remain unified in their hunger and fight.",
      "Their floor is high and this was timely evidence; without either of their first-choice centre-halves, the first-choice centre-forward available for only 15 minutes due to injury and none of their best players quite fit enough for the full game, Arsenal gutted up and held out. The obvious summer objective is to raise the ceiling so everyone is at the same level as Jakub Kiwior.",

Nottingham Forest’s last four Premier League wins have come against the teams in 15th, 16th, 17th and 19th and those points have helped set up a final day shoot-out for possible Champions League qualification.",

      "But the scene is set for a potential winner-takes-all showdown against Chelsea. Forest, who join the Blues, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City as the only clubs to win 10 or more away games in any of the last five Premier League seasons with supporters in the stands, might genuinely prefer to be on the road. The City Ground, however, will be rocking.",

      "It does not bode well for a final day the Magpies must already be dreading. Callum Wilson against the single most motivated form of Jordan Pickford there has ever been feels like a mismatch.",
      "",
      "West Ham\nIt seems entirely sub-optimal for a team’s two best players in any game to be among those already announced to be leaving at the end of their contracts in the summer. West Ham can quite easily justify the decisions not to extend the terms of Aaron Cresswell or Vladimir Coufal, but it only really works if more than one of those sticking around start to step up.",
      "Perhaps only Arsenal have a more fundamentally important summer ahead with little room for error, and the Gunners at least have the benefit of cohesion, kinship and a world-class coach entirely suited to the existing squad.",
      "Graham Potter, for all his talents, seems to be increasingly aware of how atrocious a fit he is with these West Ham players.",
      "The change in approach has been too much and the incompatibility for so many is painfully obvious. Jarrod Bowen might be good enough to thrive in any system but without even a semi-competent modern midfield everything is built on quicksand.",
      "Then West Ham’s interminable centre-forward search means that a style predicated on games being decided by the finest margins often backfires. Eight of Potter’s nine losses have been by a single goal and while he is right to point out how “in every game we’ve been competitive”, at some point that becomes an irreversible pattern of failure rather than a tantalising idea of how defeats could suddenly turn into draws or even wins if nothing actually changes.",
      "With the two surviving clubs below them almost certain not to be quite so cataclysmically awful next season, West Ham are the closest to being pulled into a relegation fight. It might take just one more inadequate transfer window, which does not bode well considering those particular failures is how this mess has been so carelessly constructed.",

      "Reguilon actually fared well enough against Aston Villa and considering his predicament has shown an unreasonable level of commitment to a badge which has wanted nothing to do with him for longer than anyone cares to remember. But it is a great bit that someone contracted to Spurs for five years has won more games for Brentford (five), Atletico Madrid (four) and Manchester United (three) than he has Spurs (zero) over the last three of them.",
      "And that isn’t the half of it. Reguilon has played the most Premier League minutes (196) of any player whose side is yet to score a single solitary sodding goal with them on the pitch this season.

      "Former Man Utd and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo has received a ‘tempting’ offer to leave Al-Nassr in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ronaldo, who currently plays for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, won numerous trophies with Man Utd, Real Madrid and Juventus before choosing to leave Europe in 2022.",
      "The Portugal legend has scored 798 goals in 1,060 club career appearances and will go down as one of the best players to have ever lived.",
      "Ronaldo left Manchester United in controversial circumstances at the end of 2022 during his second spell at the Premier League club with Erik ten Hag allowing him to leave and join Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr.",
      "The Al-Nassr star recently declared himself the “most complete player to have existed” in an interview with friend Edu Aguirre.",
      "Ronaldo said: “I’m talking about numbers. I think I’m the most complete player to have existed. In my opinion, I think it’s me. I do everything well in football: with my head, free kicks, left foot. I’m fast, I’m strong.",
      "READ: Twelve Man City players Guardiola should upgrade after FA Cup final defeat",
      "“One thing is taste — if you like Messi, Pelé, Maradona, I understand that and I respect that — but saying Ronaldo isn’t complete … I’m the most complete. I haven’t seen anybody better than me, and I say it from the heart.”",
      "And now Spanish newspaper Marca claims that the ‘absence of achievements’ at Al-Nassr since Ronaldo joined ‘has unleashed an earthquake at the club and when that happens in a Saudi entity, changes come throughout the structure and affects the field, bench and the upper echelons.’",
      "Ronaldo ‘has received a proposal from Brazilian soccer, considered out of the market for its importance’ with his ‘discomfort’ at Al-Nassr showing in recent weeks.",
      "The report adds that ‘while the storm is raging at Al Nassr’, Ronaldo has ‘received a major offer from a Brazilian team’ and the bid ‘could turn into an out-of-market offer with significant contributions from outside investors’.",
      "MORE CRISTIANO RONALDO COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Rooney tells Man City star Haaland why he will never reach heights of Ronaldo and Messi\n👉 Ronaldo wants Al Nassr to sack manager, offload four stars as three requests for new contract surface\n👉 Ronaldo tipped to ‘sniff around’ Man Utd for investment but ‘great’ option down the leagues suggested",
      "And for the Man Utd and Real Madrid legend ‘the offer is tempting and would open up the possibility of participating in the Club World Cup’ over the summer.",
      "With Erling Haaland picking up a number of injuries over the course of the season for Man City, there are some who would want to see the Norway international rested for the Club World Cup.",
      "When asked recently if Ronaldo could be a good stand-in for Haaland, former Man Utd striker Louis Saha said: “I don’t think it makes sense. It’s a tough question. It’s painful to think of Ronaldo at City. But also, I don’t think Ronaldo needs it, it wouldn’t be worth the message it would send.",
      "“Going to Man City for what? What is this new competition? For me, I don’t respect it. This competition for me is absolutely unnecessary. Almost like something strange based on the fight that they had with the Super League. I just don’t understand it.",
      "“Going there for Cristiano doesn’t make sense for me because the competition is not worth it.”",
      "Man City striker Erling Haaland has been told by Wayne Rooney why he and Kylian Mbappe will never reach the heights of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.",
      "Former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly made three remarkable demands to Al Nassr during talks over a new contract.",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Football finance expert Dr Rob Wilson has suggested Cristiano Ronaldo could “sniff around” Manchester United, but he suggested Cheltenham would be a “great” option.",
      "Former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has been backed to join arch-rivals Manchester City in a potential shock transfer.",
      "Only eight players in history have scored more Champions League knockout stage goals than Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, which really is daft."

      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:18, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:42, UK",
      "Luis Castro’s long career began in Portugal’s fourth division and has seen him rise to become one of the most accomplished coaches in world football. Football has taken the Portuguese to four different countries, winning trophies in all four of them.",
      "He was the first man to win Portugal's second tier with a B team, finished sixth with little Chaves and took Vitoria Guimaraes into Europe. Castro then won the title in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk before embarking on a new adventure in South America.",
      "When he left Botafogo in 2023, the Brazilian club were seven points clear at the top of the table and he finished that calendar year as the coach with the most wins in world football over the past 12 months - there were 51 of them, four clear of Pep Guardiola.",
      "All of which is a rather long-winded way of saying that, for all this, Castro knows by now the first question that is coming his way. That is because his most recent appointment was in Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr. So, what exactly is it like coaching Cristiano Ronaldo?",
      "Al Nassr won the Arab Club Champions Cup under Castro, the victory coming after extra-time courtesy of two goals by you know who. In total, Ronaldo scored 55 goals in 55 games under his management. \"We shared some great moments together.\"",
      "Does Castro have any special insight into how it is that Ronaldo continues to pummel goals for club and country even after turning 40? \"What set his apart is what happens before and after training - the so called 'invisible training' that he does,\" he explains.",
      "\"His behavior is all tailored towards sports performance - his diet, his sleep, and his recovery. He is a person deeply concerned with eating well, sleeping well and preparing his body properly. In my opinion, this is clearly where Cristiano's longevity comes from.\"",
      "Did it inspire others? \"Of course,\" he replies. \"Every positive example helps us grow. Our parents, our friends.\" Did he learn from Ronaldo as well? \"Coaches learn from players. Anyone who thinks they know everything becomes stuck. It is a very limiting mindset.\"",
      "Given that Erik ten Hag saw no role for Ronaldo at Manchester United, in part because of the player's inability or unwillingness to press from the front, one wonders what exactly he makes of that decision. \"We look at each player and we adjust things,\" he explains.",
      "\"We adjust according to their identity. That is exactly what I do - with Cristiano and with everyone else. That is my duty as a leader, as a coach. Our job means we have to look at the group of players and get the most out of them as a team. I have no doubt about that.",
      "\"That is why we need to find a system that enhances the players that we have. I cannot stick rigidly to a tactical system and refuse to change. I cannot just go to the end with my idea, no matter what, because that would lead to failure and disaster.\"",
      "It is interesting to hear a coach of such experience talk about the need to adapt his ideas. At the age of 63, Castro is still making those adjustments - because the game demands it. \"Football has evolved and not only the tactical systems,\" he acknowledges.",
      "\"Science has become intertwined with the game. The media are much more active. Player representation has changed. Coaching staffs have increased significantly in number and their areas of expertise. We all have to adapt to match this evolution.",
      "\"The intensity has increased, which has forced us to change our training methodologies and focus more on player recovery. We had to evolve in the tools we use and become much more comprehensive and knowledgeable about everything that surrounds us.",
      "\"A coach must be much more strategic now. In the past, coaches could be known for their tactical system. Today, I have to give my team the versatility to understand multiple systems, to make faster decisions because there is less and less room for hesitation.",
      "\"Today, it is about reading the game, solving situations. We create exercises to address these tactical changes and respond to the tactical shifts during a game, to overcome those challenges posed by the opponent and to put the opposition in difficulty too.\"",
      "In Castro's view, this represents a major change in how coaches need to approach football. \"Training sessions are much richer now. There has been a radical shift in how we look at training and how we prepare players for the various phases of a game.\"",
      "Some developments he is not so fond of. He has spoken of how youngsters are more focused on the individual than the team, but he stops short of suggesting it is a problem. \"It does require constant reminders about what teamwork should be,\" he says.",
      "\"But through good communication, the players always end up understanding and following the team path. We, as coaches, also need to recognise that the individualistic players remain assets. It is the job of the coach to connect them to the team.\"",
      "The appetite remains - Castro describes doing that as \"fantastic\" - and Portuguese coaches are proving better at it than most. There are three of them working in the Premier League at present - Ruben Amorim, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Marco Silva.",
      "\"The Premier League is the biggest showcase in world football. It is the best league in the world and has the best professionals working in it so I have no doubt that if they are there, it is because they are of excellent quality, taking a successful path to get there.",
      "\"I do not really like distinguishing coaches by nationality as quality has no nationality. But I can speak about our coaching school because it has managed to combine scientific knowledge, academic background, and the other experiences of football perfectly.",
      "\"Many of us Portuguese coaches worked in academies, which helped us to understand younger players - development programs, methodologies, and all the factors that shape a player's identity. It is about how we put individual talent into the service of the team.\"",
      "A lesson that Luis Castro learned with Cristiano Ronaldo."

      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""

      "The pressure was on for Chelsea after Aston Villa beat Tottenham, a result which would have moved them above Enzo Maresca's side had they dropped points but, after a tense wait for the breakthrough, captain Reece James set up Cucurella with a fine turn and cross.",
      "Although Ruben Amorim went with a strong line-up ahead of the Europa League final, if Chelsea had slipped up against this United side, 16th and now winless for a record eight Premier League games, questions would have been asked.",
      "Chelsea will at least be in the top five when they go to Nottingham Forest in their final game of the league season on May 25. Victory at the City Ground would guarantee a return to the Champions League after two years away.",
      "United have now lost 18 games in the league this season and are yet to hit 40 points, usually the target for teams to avoid relegation, with just one game left against Villa. Everything is riding on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham.",

      "There was a party atmosphere after the full-time whistle blew for the final time at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea's owners are just one win away from their first Champions League qualification after more than £1bn spent and three coaches sacked.",
      "Behdad Eghbali, co-founder of Clearlake Capital, and co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley were on the pitch enjoying the moment with players and staff after the win was sealed. How different it might have been if there was another slip.",
      "Chelsea did not find it as easy as others had against United and, without suspended striker Nicolas Jackson, it was not clear where the breakthrough would come from as Tyrique George, 19, struggled up front in his first league start.",
      "Tension had built around the stadium - and only grew when Villa's victory over Spurs was confirmed - until the skipper came up with the moment of brilliance required to break the deadlock, having struck a post with an exquisite strike in the first half.",
      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",

      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",
      "\"We need to feel that. We need to get angry with the critics and perform. The worst thing we can do is let it go, that is so hard to understand.\""
