      "Manchester United were awarded a penalty following an intervention from VAR after Mason Mount was thrown to the ground by Fulham defender, Calvin Bassey, during a corner.",
      "The incident seemed to go unnoticed by the match officials in play. But after being instructed to review the clash on a pitchside monitor, referee Chris Kavanagh explained to fans that Bassey was being penalised for dragging Mount down in the penalty area.",
      "A post on the Premier League Match Centre X account confirmed Kavanagh's verdict, saying: \"After a VAR review, the referee overturned the original call of no penalty for a challenge by Bassey on Mount. Referee announcement: 'After review, Fulham number 3 pulls the Manchester (United) player to the ground. The final decision is penalty kick'.\"",
      "Unfortunately for Manchester United, Bruno Fernandes spurned his golden opportunity from the spot and lashed the penalty way over the crossbar. That miss meant the half ended goalless despite a flurry of chances for both teams.",
      "During a dissection of the spot-kick shortly after Fernandes' miss, Gary Neville pointed out that an accidental bump from the referee seemed to distract the United captain just before he stepped up for the penalty.",
      "\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but he's still having a go, Bruno Fernandes, at the referee, because he feel that was a little bit clumsy.\"",
      "United made changes shortly after the half-time interval in a bid to try and break the deadlock, throwing on Benjamin Sesko to lead the line. But it was Leny Yoro, United's young centre-back, whose header was diverted into the Fulham goal by the unfortunate Rodrigo Muniz just before the hour mark.",

      "Gary Neville has questioned Manchester United’s goalkeeping situation, suggesting that Andre Onana’s confidence could be shaken to the extent that he might ask to be sold before next week’s transfer deadline.",
      "United chiefs are close to completing a £17m move for Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens, with Onana again a substitute for Sunday’s game against Fulham as Altay Bayindir remains between the posts despite an unconvincing display in the opening weekend defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Earlier in the window the Old Trafford club were linked with Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma, who now looks set to join Manchester City - but neither amounted to much more than speculation.",
      "Commenting ahead of United’s clash with the Cottagers, Neville revealed he had spoken to people inside the club who admitted a new goalkeeper remains a priority and is now left wondering if Onana might be exploring a move away.",
      "“I’ve been asking around about that one this morning and spoke to a few people at United,” Neville said. “The feeling is the new boy coming in would probably be a No2 who would start on the bench, but they absolutely do need a No1.",
      "“The main priority for United is still goals and we think (Matheus) Cunha, (Bryan) Mbeumo and (Benjamin) Sesko are going to do that. We think Onana will start today but that situation isn’t right.",
      "“Bayindir came in last week but he makes a lot of mistakes. Now that Onana knows United have been scouting around Europe for a new goalkeeper and replacement for him, his confidence must be shot at and he must be thinking he wants to get out.”",
      "The former United full back also warned that the club need to act swiftly before the transfer deadline on September 1.",
      "“They have to deal with that. That and the central midfielder slot next to Bruno [Fernandes] are the two things they need to get sorted this week.”",
      "Despite his concerns, Neville still believes Onana is the best option available to Ruben Amorim right now.",
      "Asked who he would pick against Fulham, before it was confirmed that Bayindir would remain, Neville said: “I would go with Onana, he’s the most reliable out of the unreliable goalkeepers they have.",
      "“I think Bayindir is young, Onana for me is the better goalkeeper, although he makes mistakes as well and he’s not ideal. But I think he’s got a bigger personality and character than Bayindir and he’s got that experience, so I think Onana should start.”",

      "Altay Bayindir has been given the nod to start again for Manchester United with Andre Onana being named on the bench for their trip to Fulham.",
      "Onana, 29, suffered a hamstring injury in pre-season and was not named in the squad that lost 1-0 to Arsenal last weekend despite a significantly improved performance. Bayindir was at fault for the Gunners' goal, though Ruben Amorim defended the Turkey international after the game.",
      "United are currently in advanced talks with Royal Antwerp over a €20million (£17m) deal for the Belgian outfit's promising young goalkeeper, Senne Lammens. The 23-year-old is expected to complete a move to Old Trafford imminently which will only fuel talk that Onana's days as No 1 are numbered, though he is not currently expected to be sold by the club.",
      "Speaking before Sunday's game at Craven Cottage, Amorim made it clear that he had made the call to stick with Bayindir rather than restore Onana to his XI.",
      "Bayindir failed to deal with a corner in last weekend's fixture against Arsenal, who took full advantage through Riccardo Calafiori to leave Old Trafford with maximum points.",
      "Lammens was omitted from the Antwerp side that beat Mechelen 2-1 on Saturday as talks over a transfer advance. Reports claim that he will not necessarily become an automatic starter, though, meaning all three players could be given a chance to stake a claim to consolidate themselves as Amorim's first-choice keeper in the coming weeks.",
      "Onana was joined on the bench by United's new striker, Benjamin Sesko, for Sunday's trip to the capital. There was no place in the squad for Rasmus Hojlund, who is understood to be surplus to requirements following Sesko's arrival from RB Leipzig.",

      "Manchester United transfer target Senne Lammens has been left out of the squad for Royal Antwerp's clash with Mechelen as he inches closer to joining the Red Devils. Ruben Amorim is keen to sign a new goalkeeper, with Lammens set to provide competition for Andre Onana.",
      "Onana has come under fire since joining United from Inter Milan in 2023 after making several high-profile errors, but there is a lack of genuine competition for his spot as No.1. Onana did not make the squad for United's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal last weekend and backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir was at fault for Riccardo Calafiori's winner.",
      "As a result, United are looking to sign Lammens for £17.3million and a deal appears to be very close after Antwerp did not select him against Mechelen. Yannick Thoelen was handed his first start of the season instead, while new signing Taishi Brandon Nozawa made the bench.",
      "Although Lammens expected arrival will leave Amorim with four options between the sticks, he has insisted that a new signing does not mean either Onana or Bayindir will leave. \"It's not an idea that 'these players are going to leave and then we'll receive another player',\" he said.",
      "\"We don't know what is going to happen but we are not waiting to take out someone to bring another player [in]. One thing is not responsible for the other.",
      "\"The players you're talking about are not players who are training with the group in this moment. We have a group training so it's not going to affect a lot.\"",
      "United have already strengthened their squad with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon so far this summer and Amorim believes the Red Devils are much better than they were last season.",
      "When asked if his squad are tougher, Amorim replied: \"Yeah, I think you can see that is a fact. Because you can see with the data. Then, with confidence sometimes you react a little bit sooner and you are near the ball.",
      "\"Again, against Arsenal we were sometimes building up but we had to kick the ball, and you could see the reaction of the players in the second balls — the duels — we are stronger, we are recovering our positions faster.",
      "\"I remember at least two times in the corner, one time with [Martin] Odegaard running with the ball, and you could look at our players and we are sprinting full power. Even Casemiro, is in a different pace. So, all these things, I can watch the games since the start of the season and we are consistent in that, so that is important.\"",

The Red Devils are on the road for the first time this season and will be out revenge after Fulham knocked them out of last term's FA Cup.",
      "Marco Silva's men are also in pursuit of a maiden win this season after they could only draw at Brighton last weekend. Rodrigo Muniz came to the Cottagers' rescue with a 97th-minute equaliser just when it seemed like defeat seemed assured.",
      "Despite their FA Cup exit, United did manage to complete a home-and-away double over Fulham in last season's Premier League. And the pressure is on to replicate that result on Sunday as Mirror Sport provides all the necessary information needed to tune in.",
      "The Week 2 showdown in west London will take place on Sunday, with kick-off scheduled for the Super Sunday slot of 4.30pm. And United will be hoping for a little more fortune this time around after losing to the Gunners in the same slot one week ago.",
      "The Craven Cottage clash will also be available to stream via the Sky Go app. However, customers will need a valid subscription to tune in.",
      "Both Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund missed last weekend's loss to Arsenal for different reasons. Hojlund could remain sidelined as summer signing Benjamin Sesko eyes a first start in England, while Onana could be brought back in to replace Altay Bayindir in goal.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim explained No. 1 Onana was lacking fitness, rather than his absence being tied to links of a move away. However, the Cameroonian could be brought back after Bayindir's error at a corner allowed Riccardo Calafiori to score the game's only goal.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui are otherwise injured for United and unlikely to feature here. Antonee Robinson is the only definite absence for Silva's hosts, though Ryan Sessegnon is also at risk of missing out.",

      "Marcus Rashford endured a horror first start for Barcelona as he was hauled off at half-time with the Catalans losing 2-0 to Levante - leading to a hugely critical reaction from some fans.",
      "The Manchester United loanee impressed off the bench last week as the Spanish champions made light work of Real Mallorca, but a week on and Rashford had an evening to forget as Barcelona were facing an embarrassing defeat early in the La Liga season.",
      "As a result, Hansi Flick quickly hooked the loanee, along with Marc Casado. Dani Olmo and Gavi came on to replace them and helped provide the spark that was required with Barcelona eventually completing their comeback in stoppage time to win 3-2.",
      "Pedri needed just four minutes in the second half to get the Catalans on the right track before Ferran Torres, formerly of Manchester City, equalised. Barcelona found their winner beyond the 90 minutes as Levante defender Unai Elgezabal headed into his own net from a Lamine Yamal cross.",
      "Rashford will not have furthered his case for more involvement, especially with the amount of attacking quality available to Flick at Barcelona. And several fans took aim at the Englishman.",
      "One said: \"Rashford has successfully brought the Man Utd mentality to Barca.\" Another wrote: \"You can take Rashford out of Man Utd but you can't take Man Utd out of Rashford.\"",
      "Flick refused to blame Rashford for the below par first-half performance, insisting he continues to show that he will be able to contribute as the season goes on. But ultimately Barcelona need to tweak their personnel and tactics with the United man among those sacrificed.",
      "He said: \"I think Marcus had some situations in the first half where he showed how good he is and how he can help us. This is, for me, where we have to continue. Of course, the second half, we have to change something. Raphinha on the [left] side is our No.11.",
      "\"He knows everything [about how we play]; what we want to do when he has to come inside. I think we got the right changes. But of course, when we score the first goal so early in the second half, it helps a lot for us and changed the strategy.\"",
      "Rashford is in the midst of his second successive loan spell having spent the latter part of last season with Aston Villa. The Englishman was determined to seal a switch to Catalunya to play with Barcelona, where he is now rubbing shoulders with Yamal, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski.",

      "Gabriel is just 14, but has been fast-tracked in the United academy after some stellar performances and continues to perform well above his age group. And now Amorim has made him aware that he will be given the opportunity to train with the first team on occasions this season.",
      "Amorim was told about the teenager's progress earlier in the summer and was shown video clips of Gabriel during United’s pre-season tour of the United States. He has since taken a keen interest in his development and has sat down to meet Gabriel, claims the BBC.",
      "The pair met at Carrington and the youngster watched the opening Premier League match of the season against Arsenal from the directors’ box at Old Trafford.",
      "Gabriel looks to be paying back the faith shown in him and was on target twice as United's U18s hammered Middlesbrough 5-0. The 14-year-old scoring shortly before half-time and then again 20 minutes from the end during the rout.",
      "The winger committed his future to the Manchester outfit earlier in the summer, with the club’s technical director Jason Wilcox playing a role in those discussions. That is unusual for an academy player so young and highlights just how highly he is thought of at the club.",
      "Gabriel put himself on notice after scoring twice for the U18s in a 13-1 hammering of Leeds in April. That saw him become the youngest ever player to feature for United’s U18s and the team’s manager, Darren Fletcher, is the man aiding his development.",
      "The 14-year-old's incredible rise is summed up by the fact he won’t be able to play in their FA Youth Cup campaign because he is still too young. Amorim made it clear that, this summer, he wanted to combine smart recruitment with utilising the academy to produce a squad that had quality and depth.",
      "He said: \"Then we have a plan that is to bring [in] some new players. Our big plan is to improve the team we have and improve the academy as that is our future, as it was in past. It's not going to change so much.\"",

      "Onana has come under fire since joining United from Inter Milan in 2023 after making several high-profile errors, but there is a lack of genuine competition for his spot as No.1. Onana did not make the squad for United's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal last weekend and backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir was at fault for Riccardo Calafiori's winner.",
      "As a result, United are looking to sign Lammens for £17.3million and a deal appears to be very close after Antwerp did not select him against Mechelen. Yannick Thoelen was handed his first start of the season instead, while new signing Taishi Brandon Nozawa made the bench.",
      "Crystal Palace could land two new signings with the money they've raised from Eberechi Eze's sale - but the manager and the chairman are both eyeing different individuals.",
      "Oliver Glasner has seen few new faces arrive but the departure of his star man means he and the club must now act. The Sun reports that the ex-Frankfurt boss wants Club Brugge winger Christos Tzolis, who has been a big hit in Belgium after proving to be a flop at Norwich.",
      "Palace chairman Steve Parish though is keen on Villarreal's forward Yeremy Pino. Glasner though is unclear how the 22-year-old Spaniard would fit into the team, casting doubt over his signing.",
      "The Eagles though hope that both men can be secured for around £20m, which means they could go after Pino and Tzolis if they wanted to give the money they've just raised from Eze.",
      "Aston Villa loss at Brentford on Saturday and they've been largely quiet this summer, but Unai Emery still wants to know where everyone stands.",
      "“We have to clarify some circumstances we have in the transfer window,\" said the Spaniard after the game.",
      "We have enough players but we need to clarify with some players if they are staying or not, and the possibility we can add some to help us.”",
      "Sky Germany claims that Bayern Munich have discussed potentially signing Manchester United duo Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho - which would be a hugely left field move from the Germans.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to move both on from Old Trafford and the Bundesliga champions could now enter the race.",
      "Sancho has history of excelling in Germany, previously being a hugely influential figure at Borussia Dortmund. Hojlund though would be more of an unknown.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are confident of completing a deal to sign Carney Chukwuemeka from Chelsea on a permanent transfer.",
      "The midfielder joined the Blues in 2022 after being tipped for big things at Aston Villa, but his minutes have been limited by injury and he's not currently part of the plans in west Lodon.",

      "According to a report from AS, Manchester United are among a host of clubs interested in signing Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton.",
      "The report states that Real Madrid, Manchester City and Liverpool are also interested in the 21-year-old, who has impressed since making the step up from the Championship to the Premier League last year.",
      "There was no place in the Brentford squad for Yoane Wissa, who is pushing for a move away from the club, as the Bees saw off Aston Villa.",
      "The striker is looking to secure himself a move to Newcastle and his boss felt it was best he was missing.",
      "\"I felt it was right for the group,\" said Keith Andrews. \"We needed a group today that was absolutely committed to showing what we're about. Identity, what this club is and how it's been built. I felt it was the right decision not to include Yoane today.\"",
      "Man United captain Bruno Fernandes is being targeted by Saudi clubs again - this time it is Al Ittihad who want him, according to The Sun.",
      "Fernandes was subject to interest from interest from Al Hilal earlier in the window, but wanted to remain playing in Europe, which suggests he has no interest.",
      "United will leave the 30-year-old to make his own decision again, as they did earlier this summer. It is understood that talks with Fernandes' camp have already taken place and Al Ittihad are willing to pay the midfielder £33m per year.",
      "RB Leipzig director Marcel Schafer has issued an update on Xavi Simons and admits the Dutchman could yet move to Chelsea.",
      "He told Sky Germany: “Xavi Simons is still with us. But the market is still open, you never know what might happen. Xavi has expressed his ambitions to us.”",
      "Man Utd continue to negotiate with Royal Antwerp for Senne Lammens as they look to bolster their goalkeeper ranks.",
      "The Red Devils are said to have offered £14.7m plus add-ons, but the Belgian side are demanding more and want close to £21.6m if they are to let their shotstopper leave for Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear that the arrival of a new goalkeeper will not mean one has to leave.",
      "Eddie Howe insists Newcastle will not be left without a striker as the Alexander Isak saga continues to play out.",
      "He was quizzed about the prospect of losing Isak without a replacement coming in, but he doesn't see that as a scenario that will play out.",
      "Howe said: “I don’t think the club will allow that situation to happen. We certainly can’t go through the season with no recognised striker at the football club.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta is adamant that Eberechi Eze will add another dynamic to the Arsenal attack after his move was completed on Saturday.",
      "He said: “We are absolutely delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal. He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game. What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today.",
      "\"His journey, his mentality, and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team, and we love how much it means to him and his family to be joining our club. We all look forward to start working with Eberechi soon.”",
      "We're back to bring you all the latest - stay with us as we bring you the latest gossip and any done deals!"

      "Dimitar Berbatov admitted Sir Alex Ferguson's treatment of him led to his acrimonious Manchester United departure. The Bulgarian became the Red Devils' most expensive player in 2008 when they forked out £30.75million to prise him away from Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "After scoring 21 Premier League goals in his first two seasons combined at Old Trafford, Berbatov netted 20 goals in his third season, which not only clinched his second league title in England but his first Golden Boot honour.",
      "Despite coming off what was the second-best scoring season of his career, Berbatov found games hard to come by the following season, as he appeared in just 12 league games, while scoring seven.",
      "In the last 15 games of the 2011/12 season, the former striker had just 28 minutes of action to his name. The frustration felt by Berbatov at the time could be traced back to the season prior where he was left out of the squad by Ferguson for United's 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League final.",
      "The 2011/12 campaign turned out to be the last Berbatov would be a United player as he opted to sign for Fulham. Upon his arrival in west London, he didn't hold back when revealing how his fractured relationship with Ferguson was created, admitting he wouldn't say goodbye to the Scotsman when leaving the club.",
      "Speaking in 2012 to The Guardian, he said: \"I don't think I deserved such treatment at United – not playing in the last year. I went more than 10, probably 15, times to ask the coach if they need me.",
      "\"And every time I was told that I'm an important player and should not leave, but then again I was not in the team. Maybe I should've gone when he [Ferguson] left me out of the squad for the Champions League final [in 2011]. I know he's the boss, but he has lost, to some extent, my respect because of the way he treated me.\"",
      "Berbatov revealed the writing was on the wall for him at United after he was informed by Ferguson of his decision to change the team's style of play. \"He [Ferguson] tried to explain to me that the team will be using a more direct style, with more speed,\" he explained.",
      "\"But I've never been among the fastest players, I like to hold the ball, this is my style. I found it hard to accept his decision – I still have my dignity. I scored many goals, I won the league two times, and I was the league top scorer, so it's not bad.",
      "\"I'll have no problems playing against United as this already happened in my career. But there's no point to look back again. I said goodbye to the people, who deserve it. I couldn't say goodbye to Ferguson.\"",
      "Berbatov was 31 years old when signing for the Cottagers, but that didn't stop him from continuing to be one of England's most potent strikers as he scored 15 league goals in his debut campaign.",
      "He played just one more year in England before departing for Monaco. After two years in the Principality, he enjoyed short stints with PAOK and Kerala Blasters before retiring from football in 2018.",
      "Berbatov will surely be a keen viewer when United and Fulham clash at Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon with kick-off set for 4.30pm.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Andreas Pereira revealed he dodged a conversation with Erik ten Hag to force through his exit from Manchester United. The Brazilian, who now plays for Fulham, insisted it was the best decision of his career as he sought regular first-team football and a sense of being \"loved\" by fans.",
      "Pereira left for Fulham in 2022, with the London club snapping him up in a £8.6million (rising to £10m) deal. Ten Hag had only just arrived at Old Trafford, but after years of limited opportunities under previous managers, Pereira wasn't willing to wait and see if his fortunes would improve under the new boss.",
      "After three consecutive loan spells, Pereira saw Fulham - United's Premier League opponents this Sunday - offering him the stability he had been missing. It was an opportunity he felt he couldn't turn down.",
      "\"This was when I came back to England [after my loan],\" Pereira told United legend Rio Ferdinand on his Rio Ferdinand Presents show. \"Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old.",
      "\"Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, 'Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you're going to play in the first team'. But I'd just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, 'I'm going to United'.",
      "\"That's why I didn't want to speak to Erik because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, 'Andreas, stay here. You're not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you'll be around the squad'. That's not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "Pereira, 29, came through United's youth ranks after joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2011, making 75 appearances for the first team. However, his time at the club was marked by inconsistency and stints on the sidelines, with loan spells at Granada, Valencia, Lazio, and Flamengo limiting his opportunities under various managers.",
      "Upon returning from a successful period in Brazil with Flamengo in 2022, Pereira was determined to leave permanently. The decision wasn't easy, as Pereira admitted to second-guessing himself amid the prestige of staying at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "\"Leaving United, you're like, 'Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?' In the end, you're never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave,\" he said.",
      "A key factor was his desire for consistent minutes, coupled with a yearning to reconnect with his Brazilian roots. He nearly joined Everton before opting for Flamengo on loan.",
      "\"I wanted to play, after COVID, I wanted to play. I was going crazy, wanting to play in the Premier League. I wanted to show that I was good enough, I was very close to joining [Everton] and suddenly my father called me and said, ‘Andreas, you never played in Brazil, you're Brazilian,'\" Pereira recalled.",
      "\"I wanted to play in Brazil and want to feel loved. I didn't feel the love that I thought I should get. I wanted to feel loved by my own people, play close to my family and enjoy football.\"",
      "Despite warnings from United staff that a move to Brazil might end his European career - \"Everyone at United said, 'You're crazy, you'll stay in Brazil, you'll never come back to Europe',\" - Pereira proved them wrong. He returned to the Premier League with Fulham, where he has flourished under Marco Silva.",
      "In 119 appearances, he has contributed 10 goals and 22 assists, becoming a midfield linchpin and even drawing interest from Chelsea, who eyed him as a replacement for Conor Gallagher in 2024. In three years at the West London club he's been left out of just eight Premier League games - with six of those due to an ankle injury in 2023.",
      "He was, however, an unused sub in Fulham's opening day draw with Brighton last weekend. The Cottagers snatched a point late on thanks to an injury-time equaliser scored by Rodrigo Muniz.",
      "Sunday's clash with United not only offers Pereira the chance to work his way back into the starting XI, but also to prove a point to his former club and demonstrate how far he's come. His bold choice to sidestep Ten Hag and seek a fresh start has paid dividends, transforming him from a United fringe player into a Premier League mainstay.",
      "As the two teams lock horns this evening, Pereira's story serves as a testament to the value of betting on oneself -even if it means leaving a giant like Manchester United behind.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will be eager to secure their first three points of the season while the campaign is still in its early stages, as they travel to face Fulham. Fulham opened their Premier League season with a 1-1 draw away at Brighton. Although Brighton edged the contest, Fulham will be satisfied to have come away with a point, thanks to Rodrigo Muniz’s stoppage-time equaliser.",
      "One of the biggest positives for Fulham was the standout performance of 18-year-old academy graduate Josh King. Given a surprise start in midfield, King impressed with his composure on the ball and relentless energy.",
      "For Fulham to push on this season, manager Marco Silva will need support, as the squad saw no new additions over the summer. While Fulham should have enough quality to avoid being dragged into a relegation fight, the lack of reinforcements could see them fall behind rivals who have strengthened.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, suffered a 0-1 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford in their opener. Despite the result, much of the post-match reaction was positive for Ruben Amorim’s side, who dominated large spells of the match. New signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha both made promising debuts.",
      "However, United struggled to convert their dominance into goals, and there are growing calls for Benjamin Sesko to be given a starting role to add more attacking threat. While his inclusion could make a difference, it’s clear that United need more if they are to return to the top four.",
      "The match also highlighted United’s need for midfield reinforcements. Casemiro put in a solid shift, but Fernandes lacks the physical presence for a deeper role, and Manuel Ugarte has yet to justify his £60m price tag. With Kobbie Mainoo seemingly out of favour, new midfield signings are essential if United are to progress.",
      "Despite the opening defeat, United delivered a strong performance and will head into this fixture with confidence. Fans can expect a determined display as they look to get their season up and running.",

      "Louis Saha carved out a stellar Premier League career that spanned over a decade. But most of the Frenchman's billion-pound fortune has been accumulated with his boots hung up.",
      "Saha first arrived in England on loan with Newcastle United in 1999 and made his stay permanent when signing for Fulham from Metz one year later. He would leave Craven Cottage for Old Trafford in 2004, before swapping Manchester United for Everton in 2008.",
      "Time with Tottenham and Sunderland followed before a swansong season at Lazio, but it has been through his sporting company, AxisStars, that he has amassed a great deal of wealth. The firm, which tends to \"professional athletes and entertainers, their peers and trusted partners,\" has seen Saha's net worth soar to £4.3billion.",
      "After playing just 11 times for Newcastle during the 1998/99 Premier League season, Saha was snapped up by second-tier side Fulham in 2000 for a moderate £2.1m, but soon made that price tag look cheap.",
      "The Cottagers achieved promotion to the top flight that season, partly thanks to Saha's 27 league goals, which saw him named in the PFA Team of the Year. In the Premier League, he continued to find the back of the net, scoring eight, five, and 13 league goals in three campaigns for the London side.",
      "However, things soon turned noxious when the Frenchman sought a move to the Red Devils, who had already seen two bids for him rejected in January 2004. To try to force through a move, the then-25-year-old offered up a threatening ultimatum and dubbed Fulham \"not honest.\"",
      "\"The club say they would rather sell me in six months' time, but I am fed up now,\" Saha said back in 2004. \"Either I leave now, or I am staying at Fulham until the end of my contract, which finishes in 2006. If Fulham love me that much, they are going to have to cope with me until the end, and then I will leave them for zero euros.\"",
      "This rather unsavoury scene was soon resolved when Saha made a £12.8m move to Old Trafford less than two weeks later, being handed the No. 9 shirt that Andy Cole had last worn.",
      "\"I am absolutely delighted, it's a dream come true,\" said Saha after signing. \"I would like to thank my family and all the people who have helped me through this. I am just happy everything turned out. To leave a great atmosphere like Fulham has been difficult, but I am glad to be joining one of the best clubs in the world.\"",
      "Yet, with Wayne Rooney's arrival and the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Forlan, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy in United's forward ranks, minutes were scarce for Saha in Manchester.",
      "Saha scored 42 goals in 124 appearances for the club from 2004 until 2008, when Everton signed him up to a 'pay-as-you-play' deal. He was plagued by injuries at Goodison Park but still found rich veins of form at times, even scoring in seven consecutive games during the 2009/2010 season.",
      "Tottenham signed him on a free in January 2012, and he scored three goals before being released at the end of the term. Saha then lasted only half a season with Sunderland before calling it quits after a brief spell in Italy with Lazio.",
      "He hasn't left the spotlight behind, however. Saha has impressively achieved billionaire status as CEO of the company he co-founded with Kate Hamer, an ex-marketer, that is believed to be linked to more than 500 former athletes.",
      "AxisStars' website displays a photo of Saha alongside Hamer, with a description reading: \"Since hanging up his boots, Louis has moved into the world of business where he has used his experience to develop propositions to support athletes and other people in the public eye, in their careers.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United still lost the game 1-0. But there is a new sense of optimism shared by both players and fans alike. And ahead of the trip to face Fulham at Craven Cottage, Amorim insisted: “I think you can see it (an improved physicality).",
      "“It is a fact. You can see it in the data. With confidence, sometimes you react a little bit sooner. Against Arsenal, you could see the reaction of some of our players for the second balls, the duels.",
      "“We are stronger, we are recovering our positions faster. I remember at least two times when Odegaard had the ball and you could see our players sprinting full power.",
      "\"Even Casemiro! And he's at a different pace. In the end we cannot control the results. But we have to see the game in the small things that we can do better.",
      "“Sometimes we are not going to play as well as we did in the last game. But the consistency of the movements, the intensity, the opportunities, the runs in behind. In all these small things we need to be consistent.",
      "“If you look at our last few games - and I know pre-season is pre-season - but if you look at those games and the first game in the league, we are maintaining the level.”",
      "United have invested more than £200million this summer to bring attacking trio Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester. But despite an encouraging performance against Arsenal they were still beaten by Mikel Arteta ’s below-par team.",
      "With no distraction of European football this season, Amorim believes the extra hours he will get on the training ground will start to pay-off with Premier League points. Amorim said: “We need to work during the week - and we need to score goals.",
      "“But when we are playing, I think you can see that we are more confident. I feel the team is more free in playing the game. When you have more time to train, to see the way we play, then you become free because you don’t need to think all the time about what you should do in certain situations because it’s already in your mind.",
      "“We have more time to train and prepare for the games, so they know what they need to do. We have more time to train on our base and then, in the last two days, you have time to prepare the strategic part of the game. I think it’s simple.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Fulham's rising starlet Josh King admires Manchester United's summer transfer business - but he's hoping it will work against them today. The 18-year-old attacking midfielder, born in 2007, is like a new signing for Marco Silva given the Cottagers have spent just £500k this window on a backup goalkeeper in Benjamin Lecomte. Meanwhile, United have splashed around £196.5million on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon. However, King is hopeful United's new arrivals are still settling into their new surroundings, explaining: \"They've bought quite well, some big players, big names and it will be a really nice test for us. \"It's probably a good time to play against them. As a team, we've gelled quite well, obviously the team has stayed quite similar over the past one, two, three seasons. \"That might help us out when it comes to them, because they may not have gelled as well as we have. It'll be a good test, I definitely think we'll pull through.\"",
      "King is full of confidence after earning the man of the match award in last weekend's dramatic 1-1 draw at Brighton.",
      "Substitute Rodrigo Muniz struck the winner deep into stoppage time and there's now optimism the Brazilian will be staying put after Italian side Atalanta moved onto alternative targets. Talented teen King was overjoyed to learn he would be starting at the Amex and he's almost certain to keep his spot against United.",
      "He continued: \"When I found out I was starting, I was buzzing to be honest, I was really over the moon. I called my family - it was nice! The manager has put a lot of trust in me, I feel like I can play with freedom knowing that I've got his confidence behind me.",
      "\"It's quite a nice feeling to be able to just go out and express myself on the pitch. I definitely enjoyed it, it was a good matchup against [Carlos] Baleba. He's a good player, it was a good challenge.\"",
      "England U19 international King, who made his Premier League debut against Brighton last December, signed a bumper four-year contract extension earlier this summer.",
      "He is relishing the chance to learn from Silva and a string of experienced team-mates. King concluded: \"There's some really top players who I'm training with everyday, who I'm still trying to learn from and develop.",
      "\"People like Emile [Smith Rowe] and Andreas [Pereira], it's a really nice challenge to have. It pushes me on to be better, to be training and competing with players like that.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are set to win the race for young Belgian keeper Senne Lammens. United have been monitoring the 22-year-old Royal Antwerp stopper for the past year, and have lined up a deal that will see them pay £16million plus a package of add-ons.",
      "It is understood that Lammens wants to move to Old Trafford, despite big interest in him from Galatasaray, Inter Milan and Lille.",
      "United will now look to seal an agreement with the player, although Turkish giants Galatasaray put in an 11th-hour bid on Saturday night to try and steal the 6ft 3in keeper. Lammens’ arrival will raise more doubts over the long-term future of Andre Onana.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly being chased by Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, with a meeting between the two camps already taking place.",
      "Fernandes was pursued by Saudi club Al-Hilal earlier this summer and the Portuguese playmaker looked likely to join them until he performed a huge U-turn and opted to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "There is only about a week until the summer transfer window closes and Al-Ittihad are now trying their luck for the 30-year-old in a last-gasp attempt, according to the Sun.",
      "The meeting between Al-Itthiad and Fernandes is said to have been \"positive\", the report says, and the Middle East outfit are \"very keen\" to secure his signature.",
      "During the discussions, Fernandes is said to have asked Al-Ittihad for an eye-watering contract worth around £33million a year.",
      "The reported sum Al-Hilal were offering Fernandes was around £66m a year, which would work out as £1.3m a week, making the total package around £200m for his entire contract.",
      "Fernandes is seen as central to United's re-building project, but the club are in desperate need of balancing the books after splashing out £72m on Benjamin Sesko, £71m on Bryan Mbeumo and around £62m on Matheus Cunha. Young left-back Diego Leon also arrived for £7m.",
      "So far United don't have any confirmed outgoings from permanent transfers. They did loan Marcus Rashford out to Barcelona, who will pay the entirety of his salary at the Nou Camp, while Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans all left on free transfers.",
      "But United may be tempted to clear a player off their wage bill who earns a reported £300,000-a-week at the club.",
      "Fernandes himself said earlier this summer he could leave the club if they ever wanted to cash in on him - but otherwise would stay until he was told otherwise.",
      "\"I have always been honest,\" he said. \"I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it.\"",
      "Fernandes also stressed his desire to continue playing at the highest level, adding: \"I want to play major competitions. I know I still can and I want to be happy doing the thing I love the most.",
      "\"For better or worse, this is how I see football and I'm passionate about football and this is the decision I've made.\"",

      "Arsenal icon Ian Wright has slammed the \"two-bob centre-forwards\" who laid into Viktor Gyokeres after the Swede drew a blank in the Gunners win over Manchester United. Gyokeres, 27, made a £63.7million move to the Emirates Stadium and now carries the hopes of Arsenal fans that he can fire them to the Premier League title after three consecutive second-placed finishes.",
      "However, Gyokeres was hooked after an hour at Old Trafford in Arsenal's 1-0 victory and failed to register a shot on target. It's unfamiliar territory for the Swede, who scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP.",
      "Arsenal's new forward naturally drew criticism from a section of pundits for his sub-par performance and in the days afterwards. Boss Mikel Arteta also claimed the striker has work to do to integrate with his new team-mates. However, speaking on Arsenal podcast, 'Arsecast', Wright fired back at Gyokeres' naysayers, and has fully backed the striker to succeed in north London.",
      "“What I would say to him, bro, embrace this,\" Wright said. \"Because I tell you, Viktor Gyokeres being part of Arsenal winning the title again after so many years, with the pressure he's under now, the discourse... the people I'm seeing, two-bob centre forwards on whatever it is – I won't mention where they are – talking about him like, yeah, he's a flat-track bully, whatever it is, it means f*** all, because he's where he wants to be.",
      "\"Now, it's up to him, go and get it. Just go and get it.\"",
      "Wright believes once Gyokeres' assimilates with the squad further, it will be a matter of when – and not if – that he discovers his scoring boots at Arsenal.",
      "Wright added: \"I think that obviously as a striker, and I've been there, and I'm going to Arsenal, in that first game, you'd probably want to show a little bit of what you're capable of – get a chance, half chance, maybe take it if you're fortunate.",
      "\"And even if you play like Viktor Gyokeres played against United, and he didn't really show much, if we're going to be totally honest, we saw good running into the channels, good strength and stuff like that.",
      "\"But in respect of what we're going to need, we didn't really see that. Now, that's a combination of him getting used to the team, the team getting used to him, and Man United causing us a lot of problems.",
      "\"Viktor Gyokeres has got to understand he's now at the place and, this is what I had to realise with Arsenal, he's now at the place where all that work, all that ignoring of him when he was scoring goals in different places thinking he's going to get the move, get the next move to get to where he wants to be. All that is done, because now he's at the place. So now it's on Viktor.\"",
      "On his own journey to Arsenal and how he dealt with the pressure of his own big switch, moving from Crystal Palace to Arsenal in 1991, Wright said: \"I've never felt so afraid and Viktor will be feeling the same. But then it's down to you to draw on that, the hard work, the ignoring of you, the fact that people don't think that you're as good as you think you are.",
      "\"And you've got to continue to do that in the dark. He's here, so it's now up to him to go out there and show what all that hard work is about.",
      "\"So I would say to him, even if he scored and got taken off, it'd still be for me something where he'd say, 'Well, I'm pleased I scored there, but like, okay, I could do better,' but the team weren't functioning as well. He's just got to go back into the headspace of what he does when his chances do come.\"",

      "Onana himself has not convinced during his two years in Manchester and there was talk this summer of him moving on, although he's determined to stay and prove himself once he returns to full fitness.",
      "Amorim, after Sunday's loss, maintained that he was happy with the options he had in between the sticks and any arrivals would not lead to another goalkeeper leaving Manchester with Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton currently available to him.",

      "“I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko will have to wait for a full United debut having been named on the bench at Fulham. Amorim has made just one change from the team that started against Arsenal, with Amad coming in at right wing-back and Diogo Dalot dropping down to the bench.",
      "Just one change means Bayindir retains his spot. The MEN reported on Saturday evening that Andre Onana had travelled with the squad but he has been named on the bench today.",

      "The Frenchman recovered brilliantly to deny King before going up the other end and scoring .",
      "United must find another goal to wrap up this result. There's been a good flow about this game and Fulham have played their part. They look capable in the final third and Bayindir does not look convincing in between the sticks.",
      "I think that will go down as a Rodrigo Muniz own goal because Yoro's header was going wide, but who cares?",
      "United are finally ahead at Craven Cottage thanks to a corner, and they deserve a lead.",
      "That had to happen with Casemiro. It’s bold of Amorim to go without Ugarte, but that is a reflection of how well Mount has played. United are also not winning, either, so the emphasis has to be on the attack. Mount had to stay on, given how well he’s performed and Amorim only said last week he could slot into midfield when needed.",

      "Sesko and Dalot ON.",
      "Casemiro and Amad OFF.",
      "Casemiro seeing this game out whilst on a yellow card feels like a long shot. He almost committed a daft foul there. He made way for Ugarte just after the hour last week.",
      "It is not facetious to say United would be better off with Heaton in goal. There is no way a Sean Dyche-trained goalie would be bullied like that at corners. Fulham know set pieces are the quickest route to a goal against Bayindir.",
      "Amad tries his luck from inside the box but it was fired straight at Leno.",
      "We're back under way for the second half of the game at Craven Cottage.",
      "Here are your half-time ratings:",
      "Bayindir",
      "Mixed half. 6",
      "Yoro",
      "Not put a foot wrong. 7",
      "De Ligt",
      "Had the measure of Muniz. 7",
      "Shaw",
      "Similar to fellow centre halves. 7",
      "Amad",
      "Not had enough of the ball. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Solid half but booked. 6",
      "Fernandes",
      "Skied his penalty. 6",
      "Dorgu",
      "Offered width. 6",
      "Mount",
      "Influential half. 7",
      "Mbeumo",
      "Not as impactful as last week. 6",
      "Cunha",
      "Unfortunate not to have scored. 8",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Fulham are now looking dangerous after reacing well to the penalty.",
      "Casemiro couldn’t watch when Fernandes stepped up. It’s normally safe to watch him take a penalty. That is the fifth he has failed to convert for United. It was worse than the robotic announcement from the referee, who may have referred to the United player as “Manchester player”. It was like watching the NFL.",
      "It was a penalty. A Fulham fan was spitting in saliva in celebration, he was so delighted as he felt the call so unjust. But Bassey was brainless.",
      "Bayindir has had a couple of good moments but a couple of bad ones, too. That was jittery keeping again - before and after the corner.",
      "The referee awards a penalty for Bassey's foul on Mount.",
      "Bruno Fernandes steps up but fires his effort well over the bar.",
      "This should be given - Bassey brought down Mount from the corner.",
      "Fulham must feel like they’ve ridden out the storm. United have had the standout chance of the game but have hardly been dominant. Bayindir has brushed glass clippings off his gloves after a couple of saves and United’s early intensity has subsided. Both sides have had two attempts on target and the same number of shots (five).",
      "Amad has just slapped his hands against his thighs. Casemiro then tried to force the issue with an overhit pass. Amad has been underused but that isn’t necessarily a criticism of United as they have gone down the middle for their two best chances/opportunities.",
      "Cunha has been brilliant to watch again. It’s a pity for him and for United he’s not been able to change the scoreboard as he has been the best player out there.",
      "Rodrigo Muniz is starting to look a little frustrated. He’s just had quite an animated exchange with Alex Iwobi about something or other. Fulham have not targeted Muniz that often, though when they did at Old Trafford 18 months ago United had Victor Lindelof in their defence.",
      "Bayindir has made a few saves, so he'll be happy with his start, but he was all over the place again from that corner. He's not strong enough in the six-yard box and Fulham know it.",
      "Cunha is wondering what he has to do to score. That was a terrific save from Leno. He reacted well. It wasn’t as if Cunha hit it straight at him. But it’s another golden chance for a team that has gone more than 100 minutes of the new season without a goal.",
      "Bayindir merits credit for the kick. His distribution was actually okay last week, not that anyone was going to mention it after his error. He could actually have been quicker off his line for the earlier chance and the shot, as suspected, was nowhere near the target. Bayindir still intervened to ensure there was no danger.",
      "Cunha denied at point-blank range by Leno - he should have buried that chance.",
      "Bayindir did well to deny Fulham with his legs there - decent save from the goalkeeper.",
      "It's been an impressive start from United. The passing has been slick and they are playing with a purpose. They have created a few chances already and could be ahead. Cunha and Mbeumo are looking really good again.",
      "Someone was just shouting at the referee that Mbeumo elbowed someone last week. Bassey was barely grazed there. His reaction was an embarrassment. If he hadn’t have milked the minor contact he’d still be on the pitch, though normally a player goes off if they have had treatment. The referee made himself look daft there.",
      "Mount just told Dorgu to get back to the wing. Ie. leave the pressing to me. Mount was already on the edge of the Fulham area with the net still rippling.",
      "United’s performance was an odd one last week in that they were much more fluid with a strikerless front three yet playing without a striker has not actually been working. Their intent here has been admirable from the get-go."

      "They outperformed Arsenal in just about every metric apart from the most relevant one on the scoreboard. Altay Bayindir was as responsible for that as much as Arsenal's goalscorer, Riccardo Calafiori.",

That fuelled the confidence in a happy camp whose harmony was protected by the omission of the 'bomb squad' members, with five of them still on the club's books.",
      "Both of United's wins in the United States came with Rasmus Hojlund in the starting XI. In the three matches since, United have started without an out-and-out striker and none of their starters have scored from open play. Benjamin Sesko has to make his full debut at Craven Cottage.",
      "\"Maybe when you have a good performance, even in pre-season, you get confidence,\" Amorim opined, \"then you have more time to train, you have more time to understand the way we play, you don’t need to think all the time, 'what do I do in these situations?' It’s already in their minds.",
      "\"It’s a lot of things and hard to pinpoint one reason.\"",
      "Fulham are one of only two teams that lost both of their league fixtures against United last season. Winning regularly would be a more welcome new normal at United.",

      "Manuel Ugarte did nothing to earn a place in the starting XI last week but United cannot go on with Casemiro. They need to try and make it work with the defensive midfielder they shelled out up to £50.75m for last year.",
      "Amad and Benjamin Sesko would make a promising attack even better.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "United performed well against Arsenal and did not deserve to lose, so I would make just three changes to take on Fulham. The first would be replacing Bayindir with Onana. Bayindir was at fault for Arsenal's goal last weekend, and it says something when fans are desperate for Onana to return.",
      "Dalot was preferred to start at right wing-back, but I would start Amad at Craven Cottage. Amad was bright from the bench against Arsenal and should be rewarded with a start.",
      "Finally, Sesko must start down the middle after making a cameo from the bench.",

[De Bruyne] doesn't need any advice; I need advice from him!",

      "Indeed, should the 29-year-old depart Craven Cottage for a fee in the next ten days, then United could be entitled to a portion of the transfer fee that Fulham will receive.",

      "The Brazilian spent 11 years at United and, despite only making 45 Premier League appearances for the club, the clause negotiated by United's transfer chiefs means they would be entitled to 20% of any profit Fulham make on the midfielder.",

      "Amorim had refused to confirm whether Andre Onana would return in goal at his pre-match press conference just two days earlier, and so Altay's Bayindir's inclusion wasn't necessarily a shock either, as costly as that call proved to be.",
      "The third contentious call was in midfield, but with Casemiro having started United's biggest game in decades just months earlier and Manuel Ugarte failing to impress on a consistent basis in pre-season, a lot of fans saw it coming.",
      "All three decisions set alarm bells ringing, but with added context they at least looked understandable.",

Having been overlooked for so long, and given the dark clouds hanging over the club for the majority of last season, his drive and ability to give fans something to cling onto last season truly were a testament to his character as much as his quality.",
      "Having carried United for so long last season alongside Bruno Fernandes, new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were meant to provide support for Amad when it came to carrying the attacking burden. Yet instead their inclusion in the starting XI meant Amorim felt he wasn't so dependent on Amad's attacking flair and he opted for the more defensive-minded Diogo Dalot instead.",
      "Dalot didn't do much wrong against Arsenal and he got into some good attacking positions, but he's never going to get fans on their feet like Amad, and the Ivory Coast international injected more energy into the attacks when he was introduced just before the hour mark.",
      "With no European football at Old Trafford this season, United's campaign could be limited to just 40 games, and will definitely be no longer than 51 games. The reduced workload means Amorim can afford to pick his best players week in, week out, in the Premier League at the very least.",
      "Amad absolutely is one of United's best players and shouldn't begin another league game from the bench.",

      "Mainoo, 20, rejected United's initial proposal at the start of the calendar year and Chelsea were linked with a move for the midfielder in the winter transfer window.",
      "Although Mainoo has failed to regain his place in the United first team, their shortage of midfielders means he will almost certainly stay beyond the closure of the summer transfer window.",
      "Mainoo was 17 when he last signed a contract with United and his current deal expires in 2027 but the club has the option of an additional year.",
      "Amorim stressed it was director of football Jason Wilcox's responsibility to tie down players on new contracts. \"That part is with Jason, so he is our player. He has a contract, I didn’t hear any news about that.\"",
      "Mainoo has started only 15 times since Amorim was appointed head coach in November last year and the academy graduate was an unused substitute in United's opening Premier League defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Amorim started Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in midfield against the Premier League runners up and Mainoo was trialled as one of the two playmakers and even as a striker last season.",
      "The England international suffered two lengthy injury lay-offs last year and Amorim spoke optimistically about Mainoo's development during the pre-season tour but the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 system has jarred with Mainoo's skill set.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders and it is a different way of playing,\" Amorim reiterated. \"They have to understand, the young players, there are phases in the season. Nowadays it's normal, with a lot of games, things are going to change. But he is there, he is fighting, he is training, he is one more option for us to win games.\"",
      "Defenders Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui remain the only two players out injured for United's second fixture of the campaign at Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Andre Onana is expected to be recalled, though Amorim refused to say who would start in goal.",

One wonders if he has worked on trying to improve his coaching skills over the Summer to the point where he can add at least one alternative to his current one dimensional approach. Penny for Nwaneri’s thoughts too. We are led to believe he hesitated on signing his new deal because of concerns about his minutes.

      "The Premier League of today is missing the antic energy, the pure fun of those lovable upstarts, the late 80s/early 90’s Wimbledon teams. Antagonistic manager, unlikable owner Sam/Stan, ball in the mixer, hilarious disciplinary record, scoring loads of scrappy goals from corners. I love that Arteta has attempted to recreate that style and bring fun and joy back to our sterile football world. He truly is a student of the game.",
      "Eze is the final piece. The cheeky chappy Dennis Wise figure who might even end up with a handful of England caps. He’s going to need to look out for the midfield Martins (a very 90’s British name) cutting his suit in half though! Or that big lump up front who scores four goals a season Big Victor Fashanu setting fire to his pants! How about ole David Raya/Beasant, ready to punch any one, any time the ball comes near him! Look out! And don’t mess about with this lot or Vinnie Rice will be right in with a reducer early doors!",
      "The brilliance of Arteta is to realize that the key to winning is not your fancy creativity in the final third of your Cities or you Liverpool’s, or your Wenger’s, no sir. What you need is to get the ball in the box high and early for the big man. He wins a corner or a long throw, then your other big lads crash the box and bundle it in! It’s the Arsenal way!",
      "I can hear Arsenal fans protesting right now. No! We pass the ball sometimes! Wimbledon never almost won the league! It’s all about marginal gains! (which I think is what you get by spending marginally less than a billion quid?) but I say why protest? You’re living the dream! Watching Arsenal every week is not a torturous slog akin to a five hour documentary on making paint, in Romanian, with no subtitles, no! It is pure, golden nostalgia. A throwback to a simpler time.",

      "Of course, conceding a record 497 goals and finishing one place above the relegation zone will always have the ‘your defence is sh*t’ line thrown at you. Negative. It was always the set up. These are very good players and, despite my reservations of Vic as a truly elite goalie, this back 5 has genuine potential to be very miserly indeed.",
      "Hard to get too excited after beating ‘just’ Burnley. And some may even argue that Spurs v City doesn’t count much either, because we have some curse over Pep, but I’m getting semi-excited. Not a semi though, don’t worry.",
      "It’s been a horrible week for Spurs on the old internet. This whole Eze thing has got the fanbase evoking Sol Campbell emotions. Which is weird. Eze, an Arsenal fan and once at their academy, decides to sign for *check notes*, oh, Arsenal. Hardly a f***ing surprise is it.",
      "Let me give you some advice, stay off socials and just watch the footy. It might leave you feeling happier and lighter.",
      "Anyway, despite Levy absolutely Levy’ing this transfer window – no MGW, Eze, Rodrygo, Rogers, Paz or the million others we’ve been linked with – we’ve got Frank coaching the team to play as a team and making us look mightily decent, even without key creative players in Madders and Kulu. He’s even got Richy looking like an actual football player, which he has very rarely done in a Lilywhite top.",
      "I’m not sure we get anyone else in. If we do, it’s probably underwhelming. The challenge will be when we are playing multiple games per week. For now, though, we look like a very decent prospect. I expect the top 4 to be Pool, City, Ars*nal and Ch*lsea. 5th? Who knows. Could we? Maybe. Qualification for a European comp would definitely represent success this season. That plus the CL and FA Cup. F*** it, and the league cup.",

      "Logic not your strong point, I guess.",
      "Also, ftr, there is no comparison between Coutinho whilst playing for Liverpool and Isak in present day. Coutinho was far better – the conversation of the time was whether he or Hazard was better… and then they both went to Spain and flopped. Often, players don’t perform as well out of the environment that made them stars. Doesn’t mean they weren’t utterly fabulous for those clubs in the Premier League in a way that Isak can’t claim to be after just one season or so of superb football. If he can do it for, say, 5 years in a row, then sure.",
      "Also worth remembering that Newcastle are demanding 150% of the current British transfer record, and Liverpool are offering as an opening offer 110% of it. It’s not as if anyone is being stingy here.\nJon, Bridgwater.",
      "",
      "Isak, promises and perspectives…\nOn Isak. People keep pointing at the Coutinho deal like it somehow makes £150m for Isak reasonable. Come on. The Coutinho fee was Barca losing their minds after PSG nicked Neymar. Liverpool didn’t set a trend, they just cashed in and we’ve been laughing about it ever since. That doesn’t suddenly mean Isak is “worth” £150m.",
      "Newcastle can value him however they like, but let’s not pretend Isak agrees with them. I’d be stunned if he wasn’t told something along the lines of “if a big bid comes in, we’ll look at it.” A record bid did come in and Newcastle basically said “jog on.” No wonder the lad’s annoyed. Liverpool have already tested the water with £120m talk, and he can see it. If you were him, wouldn’t you feel stitched up?",
      "As for this “Liverpool don’t need another attacker” argument – nonsense. We’ve lost players, spaces need filling. This isn’t disruption, it’s evolution. You refresh a title-winning side or you fall behind. The new signings are bedding in fine, and another attacker doesn’t change that. The whole point is to set the squad up for the long term, not just this season.",
      "And Newcastle “acting like a big club” by clinging on? Please. Real big clubs know when to cash in, reinvest, and come back stronger. Newcastle look terrified of life without Isak because they know they can’t find anyone close. That’s not Liverpool’s problem, it’s theirs.",
      "And while I’m here, my last mail about the racist abuse of Semenyo and the disgraceful comments that followed never got published. Felt like a cop-out. The abuse was vile, but instead of focusing on supporting Semenyo, too many people in your comments used it as another excuse to bash Liverpool. That isn’t rivalry, it’s just bitter nonsense, and it lets the actual racist off the hook.",
      "So, back to football. £150m is silly money, Isak feels let down, Liverpool are evolving, Newcastle are clinging on, and this whole saga is dragging on longer than Odemwingie in a car park. At some point, they’ll either take the cash or they’ll end up with a striker who magically develops calf injuries every other week.\nLJ DUB – LFC stranded in Salford",

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "18=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nIt is still very early days but really not much more Thomas Frank could have done. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’d get on operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. Remarkably, he appears to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nAn earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "15=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "15=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "15=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least.",
      "",
      "11=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "11=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "5=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, and it really might just be that West Ham are that bad.",
      "",
      "5=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "5=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "3) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "2) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "",
      "1) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nAlways felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner."

      "",
      "",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "9=) Chris Wood (2)\nThe Nottingham Forest striker smashed in two goals v Brentford in his opening game of the season on the back of a fine 24/25. Does seem slightly disrespectful that his two goals in one game sees him comfortably trailing plenty of none-in-two merchants at this time.",
      "",
      "7=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "7=) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "5=) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "5=) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "3) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (2)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",

We can’t see either club getting Rogers out of Villa before the deadline without doing something mental.

That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",

      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Tottenham\nReports in Spain suggest Spurs have agreed a deal. Colour us sceptical. Very. F***ing. Sceptical. Rodrygo’s representatives are clearly trying to create a buzz around the Brazil star, with Liverpool, City and Spurs all said to be interested. The Liverpool links don’t pass the sniff test. Spurs are bound to do something big and probably daft before the deadline, but more likely is that they go for Savinho. Which could free up space for Rodrygo at City…",

It does, though, make £60million sound more palatable but even that is too much for any club that hasn’t lost their mind. Desperation, though, can make you do funny things and Newcastle are said to have been in touch with Chelsea in recent days. Bayern Munich too, and Villa continue to be linked, but Newcastle feel the most likely club to offer anything more than a loan-to-buy deal.",

Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million.

Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",

      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "11) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",

      "",
      "10) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get rid.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Manuel Akanji – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nThe City defender was left out of the defeat to Tottenham amid talk of interest from Galatasaray. Which City are likely to encourage given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent. Savinho was left out of the City squad that faced Spurs on Saturday.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first. Nkunku seems to be the one this deal hinges on.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Bilal El Khannouss – Leicester to Crystal Palace\nThe Foxes playmaker is being linked with Spurs, Newcastle, Leeds, and probably a few other Premier League clubs but Palace appear better placed while they look for a replacement for Eze with £60million burning a hole in their pocket. El Khannouss was left out of Leicester’s squad to face Charlton on Saturday.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnaruma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him. We anticipate another less mischief-making offer after Monday night’s clash between the two sides at St James’ Park and the nagging feeling remains this will get done.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nPerhaps spooked by Tottenham’s interest, Everton have finally agreed a deal worth £42million which includes £6million in add-ons and a 20 per cent sell-on clause for the Saints. Can the Toffees get it done to parade him before the first Premier League game at the new gaff on Sunday?",

      "Liverpool have been backed to sign Alexander Isak “sooner rather than later”, while Newcastle United have made two ‘transfer decisions’.",

And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",

      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",

      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",

      "",
      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",

      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",

      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "2) Arsenal – £254.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudged Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes. Then came Eberechi Eze for another £60m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "So, it’s hardly surprising that she has spoken out in defence of Rabiot, accusing Marseille of “lying” about the alleged incident.",

      "“There was no unheard-of violence, there was an altercation. What I can say, and then Adrien will give his version, is that at the beginning, it wasn’t even between Rowe and him, but between Rowe and Geronimo. Pierre-Emile and Adrien came to separate them. And then it went freestyle.",
      "“But all we heard… The coach who has never seen that, while he is always yelling and barking… And, then, he was shocked? There is nothing shocking, it happens in every locker room, it has already happened and it will happen again. The punishment is totally disproportionate. Everyone knows it, they are lying.”",
      "When further asked if she thinks the club decided in favour of De Zerbi rather than Rabiot?, Veronique said: “It’s less problematic to change a player than the coach… Ah, I hadn’t thought of that! Indeed… It’s him or it’s me. Possible.”",

      "Veronique Rabiot later brought up De Zerbi’s treatment of ex-Man Utd forward Greenwood as an example of the Marseille boss giving a player a “second chance”.",
      "She added: “I just want to remind people that we can’t say ‘unbelievable violence’ if neither player is injured. I want to tell them to show us the footage… I still wonder how we can treat Adrien like this when we know all the sacrifices he made to come to OM. To mistreat him like this after everything he did last season is unbearable. That’s what’s most shocking.",
      "“I didn’t know people could be treated like this. He was so happy to be here, but in the end, they treat him like an outcast, like a bad guy… To think we’ve never seen this is crazy.",
      "“When Greenwood signed after hitting his wife, De Zerbi said we could give him a second chance. I agree with giving people second chances, but is it only my son who doesn’t get a second chance? I assume he doesn’t owe OM anything because he paid in advance. It’s OM who should thank him and not disrespect him.”",

      "But they should perhaps pump the brakes after casting an eye over this truly appalling comprehensive list of honking flops who have made the move from Real Madrid to the Premier League, in order of transfer fee.",
      "",
      "19) Christian Karambeu (Middlesbrough, £2.1m)\nWe’re in absolute agreement with Karambeu, who insisted his move to Teeside from Madrid was a “big, big deal” on the back of two Champions League titles in three years for Los Blancos, to go with his World Cup and European Championship winners medals with France. Boro finished 14th in his only season before Karambeu upped sticks to Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "18) Davor Suker (Arsenal, £3.5m)\nBought as a replacement for Nicolas Anelka, who moved in the opposite direction for £22.3m, it’s fair to say Croatia’s World Cup 1998 hero wasn’t quite like-for-like, scoring just 11 goals in 39 appearances. Fortunately Arsenal also signed a certain Thierry Henry in the same summer.",
      "",
      "17) Fernando Morientes (Liverpool, £6.3m)\nHe managed just 12 goals in 61 appearances and later admitted he was the “worst version of myself” during a two-year stint as Anfield which was “killing me slowly”. Yikes.",
      "",
      "16) Jonathan Woodgate (Middlesbrough, £7m)\nAfter two injury-ravaged seasons at the Bernabeu, Woodgate returned to fitness and form at Boro before moving to Spurs in January in 2008 and immediately becoming the second-last (yes, the second last) trophy-winning hero.",
      "",
      "15) Njitap Geremi (Chelsea, £6.9m)\nArriving in the first cash-laden summer of the Romano Abramovich era, his always felt like a slightly odd signing after a decent but not world-beating season on loan from Madrid at Middlesbrough. After 19 starts in his debut season under Claudio Ranieri, Geremi was never more than a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, though we’re sure he’s perfectly happy with a haul of two Premier Leagues, two League Cups and an FA Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham, £8m)\nWe’re not sure whether Tottenham fans will be delighted or sickened by Van der Vaart claiming the Harry Redknapp side he played in with Gareth Bale and Luka Modric was “the best team I ever played in” having left Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema, Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy behind him at Real Madrid.",
      "That may well have been the peak ‘Spurs are fun but are never going to win anything’ period and Van der Vaart was a big reason for that, presumably swapping notes with Jamie O’Hara over their future roles as Tell It Like It Is pundits, colloquially known as ‘pr*cks’.",
      "",
      "13) Esteban Granero (QPR, £9m)\nHe joined as one of several ‘marquee signings’ among 15 in total in that mad 2012 summer which was entirely predictably QPR’s undoing as they finished bottom of the table.",
      "",
      "12) Claude Makelele (Chelsea, £16.8m)\nComfortably the best Premier League signing from Real Madrid, Makelele made 217 appearances for Chelsea, winning five major trophies including two Premier League titles and has one of the most enduring legacies of any footballer to play in England, with clubs now spending nine-figure sums to fill The Makelele Role, albeit for slightly more well-rounded players than the diminutive Frenchman.",
      "",
      "11) Michael Owen (Newcastle, £16.8m)\nThere’s a misconception that injuries stopped Owen from reaching the Premier League heights he enjoyed before moving to Real Madrid on his return to the English top flight. But he played 29 and 28 games in consecutive seasons for Newcastle and was just a bit balls, scoring 19 goals across the two.",
      "",
      "10) Danilo (Manchester City, £26.5m)\nWe would refer to Danilo as a rare misstep in the Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain era in a summer in which they also signed Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, who’ve done alright, but they somehow managed to make a £7.5m profit on the Brazilian after two years of not doing very much at all.",
      "",
      "9) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham, £25m)\nFor a famously miserly football chief, Daniel Levy does choose to spend Spurs’ money very strangely at times. He was entirely duped by five knockout games for Reguilon on loan at Sevilla to help them to the Europa League, and five years and 73 games after joining Spurs, the full-back is now without a club having left at the end of his contract.",
      "",
      "8) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal, £30m)\nOdegaard is presumably the recent example Rodrygo is hoping to mimic with his eyes on the Premier League. The playmaker was destined for great things when he signed for Madrid as a child but needed to leave to realise his potential, and while Rodrygo’s situation is different in that he’s proved he’s good enough for Real Madrid while still at Real Madrid, he will be attracted to a major role similar to Odegaard’s at a top English side.",
      "",
      "7) Raphael Varane (Manchester United, £40m)\nWe wonder whether Manchester United signing a centre-back with far more miles in his legs than his 28 years for £40m would be seen in more negative terms had it not been for his 30-year-old pal signing for £60m a year later.",
      "",
      "6) Robinho (Manchester City, £32.5m)\nQuite the 2008 deadline day for City, with Robinho arriving along with all the Abu Dhabi cash after their takeover of the club. The Brazilian announced his delight at signing for Chelsea in his first City press conference and manager Mark Hughes later claimed he believes he didn’t recognise him and was “expecting to see Sir Alex Ferguson at the airport”.",
      "",
      "5) Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea, £40m)\nThe ultimate close-but-no-cigar footballer in many ways as he’s never really been a key cog after leaving Inter for Real Madrid in 2015, as illustrated by him having four Champions League winners medals but not playing a single minute in the three for Real Madrid and just 10 minutes for Chelsea in 2021.",
      "",
      "4) Mesut Ozil (Arsenal, £42.5m)\nHe left Arsenal with a reputation of being work-shy, but mercurial may be a better description of an absurdly talented footballer who could do astonishing things with the ball at his feet but also often went missing in games, particularly at the end of his time at the Emirates. We’re not quite sure of the definition of a ‘streets won’t forget footballer’ but Ozil was somewhere between that and world class.",
      "",
      "3) Alvaro Morata (Chelsea, £58m)\nMorata has said he “stopped enjoying football” at Chelsea and that was pretty clear to everyone watching. “I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing.”",
      "",
      "2) Casemiro (Manchester United, £60m)\nThere was undoubtedly an uptick in Casemiro’s performances at the end of last season, but he had set a very low bar by his standards to hobble over and we are very amused by what looks to be a reasonably decent chance of him starting the coming season at the base of Ruben Amorim’s midfield after well over a season of desperation to be rid of him.",
      "",
      "1) Angel Di Maria (Manchester United, £59.7m)\nHe actually started very well, with three goals and six assists in his opening 10 Premier League games, and Amorim would bite your hand off for a forward with a goal contribution ever 126 minutes as Di Maria managed in his solitary season at Old Trafford.",

      "There’s a top-of-the-table Premier League clash to enjoy at the earliest possible opportunity, while the Bundesliga’s brave new broadcasting era has us briefly intrigued.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Manchester City v Tottenham\nThe fixture computer has blessed us with a top-of-the-table clash at the earliest possible moment. Unless you consider Arsenal v Aston Villa on the very opening day such a thing, in which case you’re a damn fool. Even more so if you’re going to start indulging AFC Bournemouth and their Acme shenanigans in such alphabet-based nonsense.",
      "No, the second weekend of the season is the first time such a thing can legitimately happen, when you have a whole one game’s worth of compelling evidence of how the entire season might look, as long as every other team in the league is roughly as bad as Wolves and/or Burnley.",
      "Embryonic league table whimsy aside, it’s still a fascinating game. Historically, City v Spurs is already a fixture simply not to be missed by anyone for any reason. It has delivered goals, goals, goals and a frankly absurd number of pants-pullings by silly old Spurs.",
      "Last season’s 4-0 splattering was Spurs at their Angeball best against City in the very deepest depths of their astonishing season-wrecking autumn funk, but the wildest thing about that result is that it is only very slightly an outlier.",
      "Working backwards from that game, the Etihad encounters between these two during the Pep era have finished 0-4, 3-3, 4-2, 2-3, 3-0, 2-2, 1-0, 4-1 and 2-2. And let’s not forget that ludicrous Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2019, which City actually won 4-3 on the night as Spurs went through on away goals.",
      "It has been as close to guaranteed entertainment as the Premier League can offer. We’ve run it through the supercomputer and this fixture has the highest xN (expected nonsense) stats of any in the entire Barclays universe.",
      "And yet even without the fact it’s a top-of-the-table clash with sky-high xN values, it would still be the game of the weekend anyway for actual reasons. City looked a million dollars against Wolves last weekend, while Mohammed Kudus and Richarlison looked like absolute world-beaters for Spurs against Burnley.",
      "There were hugely encouraging signs for both teams’ seasons. But the phrases ‘against Wolves’ and ‘against Burnley’ mean care must be taken. We don’t yet really know how much of what we saw last weekend was these teams being good and those teams being rubbish. We have an inkling about which victory/performance was the more reliable long-term indicator, but we don’t yet know.",
      "We should have a far clearer idea about both teams after this game, even if it is one that itself has recent history for deception.",
      "Spurs, because they are Spurs, come into this game on the back of a week where they’ve once again decided to subject their fans to another of their trademark ritual humiliations for sh*ts and giggles, while also taking the bold step of unsettling and alienating the striker who scored two brilliant goals for them on the opening weekend. There really is nobody else who does it like Spurs do.",
      "But we already have a decent clue as to how Thomas Frank might set them up for this one. The Super Cup final ended in disappointment but for 85 minutes Frank’s 3-5-1-1 really did work strikingly well and if we’re honest we suspect Spurs would cheerfully take a 2-2 draw from this one.",
      "In a way, the transfer failings of this week and the summer as a whole make Frank’s job easier for this specific game. He can’t be accused of going too defensive when he has literally no No. 10 anyway.",
      "There seems no reason not to go to City and try the triple-pivot midfield that made life so awkward for PSG in Udine, while who doesn’t want to see Kevin Danso launching long throws at John Stones’ head?",
      "For City, it’s also a bit of a free hit in its ridiculous way. A sterner test than poor denuded Wolves could provide, surely, and one where a compelling victory would lay down a significant early-season marker about just how back they might be. But also one in which failure can just be shrugged off and put down to xN.",
      "READ: Ranking all 97(!) players left out of opening Premier League matchday squads by how p*ssed off they might be",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Eberechi Eze\nA good way to endear yourself to a new club’s fanbase is to have completely pied off their biggest rivals along the way. Emmanuel Petit knew it. Willian knew it. Eden Hazard knew it. But perhaps nobody has ever known it quite like Eberechi Eze, who kept Spurs on the hook until Arsenal’s time of need was upon them.",
      "Spurs must have known this could happen, and that it would look just awful – especially in the wake of the Morgan Gibbs-White fiasco. We do think Eze would have joined Spurs, but we do think it would only have happened once he was absolutely definitely certain Arsenal weren’t coming back.",
      "The whole ‘Oh he just wants to play in the Conference League qualifier to help Palace out before he leaves’ turned out to be the bullsh*t it always appeared to be, a convenient way to drag a transfer out even when dealing with the arch transfer-dragger-out himself in Daniel Levy.",
      "The result is Eze being an absolute hero to Arsenal fans before he’s even kicked a ball for them. It’s a lovely place to be. And it’s distinctly possible he still won’t kick a ball this weekend, but he’s still going to be the player to watch.",
      "He’ll surely at the very least be presented to the crowd before Arsenal’s opening home game of the season against Leeds, and should help ensure a buoyant atmosphere. There will be songs. There will be p*ss-taking. There will be endless shots of Eze in the stands watching on and penny-for-his-thoughtsing from the commentators.",
      "And that’s the worst-case scenario. That’s if he doesn’t play. Imagine if he does.",
      "READ: Eberechi Eze might be Arsenal’s Bruno Fernandes or Mo Salah",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Manchester United\nThere was a lot to like about Manchester United’s performance against Arsenal on the opening weekend, but any optimism from that narrow, unfortunate defeat will dissipate quickly if they don’t get a result at Fulham this weekend.",
      "United were simply unready and unprepared for the start of the new season, still stuck with the same utter absence of reliable goalkeepers. It is staggering to us how often really big clubs do this. The window may be open until September 1, but the start of the season is in mid-August, and those games do still count. It wasn’t sprung on United with no notice.",
      "Another week has passed and nothing has been done to address the most obvious and glaring of issues.",
      "Fulham were as lucky to nab a point at Brighton as United were unlucky to walk away with nothing against Arsenal, but they represent a deeply awkward second fixture given the way the first one has gone.",
      "Fulham away is nobody’s idea of an easy game. It is not one where victory would normally necessarily be mandatory. But for United, after last season and the way the opening weekend panned out, it already feels like one where the result is of far greater importance than performance.",
      "This is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. You can’t be taking the positives if you find yourself with one point or worse from two games after finishing 15th the previous season and when the flaws in your squad are and remain so very, very obvious.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: David Moyes\nIt will be a proud moment when Moyes leads his Everton team out against Brighton for the first ever Premier League match at their magnificent new stadium, but one that he surely approaches now with a touch of trepidation.",
      "The wave of optimism he and Everton rode on his return to the club last season has crashed, and Monday night’s effort at Leeds was a pretty pitiful one for an established Premier League club against a newly-promoted one.",
      "Everton were passive and ponderous, allowing Leeds to set the tone and tempo of the game throughout. It nearly delivered a point – although for what it’s worth we simply cannot understand the fuss around the penalty given the way James Tarkowski moved his arm towards a ball coming at him from such a distance – but it wasn’t exactly a showing to inspire confidence for the season ahead.",
      "A new stadium is blessing and curse, with home advantage no longer quite the familiar helping hand it once was as everyone gets used to the new surroundings. Yet Everton and Moyes cannot afford to make a slow start to life on the docks if the club is to avoid the kind of worries and anxiety that have been all too common in recent Premier League seasons.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Charlton v Leicester\nIt’s not been a convincing start to life back in the Championship for Leicester, who needed a late goal to beat existential dread’s Sheffield Wednesday at home and then lost at Preston having also gone out of the Carabao to League One Huddersfield.",
      "Charlton, meanwhile, are at this early stage faring rather better on their own return to the second tier from the other direction having beaten Watford, drawn with Bristol City and avoided Carabao banana skins (their newest flavour of surely deliberately undrinkably unpleasant energy drink).",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig\nWe don’t normally include Friday night games in here, but come on. Bayern v Leipzig would be a fine opening night Bundesliga game in a regular season. But now it comes with added Mark Goldbridge. You have to admit you’re intrigued.",
      "You can watch it on the BBC as well if you like, or on YouTube. But out of sheer morbid fascination if nothing else we’ll be watching to see just how and how quickly the world’s most Deliberate Partridge performatively perma-furious internet ragebaiter manages to make Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig all about Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "Just this once. And then never again.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have ‘raised their offer’ for a ‘top target’ after being beaten in the race to sign Arsenal newbie Eberechi Eze.",

      "And no we didn’t fully understand when we started just how massive this was going to get. We are and remain idiots incapable of working out the kind of final answer a sum roughly working out at 20 x 5 might produce. But we are also blaming Sunderland for having just too many players and turning our brain into absolute mush.",
      "On which note, sorry if any injured or suspended players have slipped through the net here. Call us names in the comments by all means. But we’ve tried our best to sieve them out, as well as not including any players signed in the few days or so before the opening games for whom day-one absence is largely to be expected.",

      "89) Freddie Woodman (Liverpool)\nWe’d imagine Woodman was under no illusions about his status when joining Liverpool this summer.",
      "",
      "88) Armin Pecsi (Liverpool)\nThere’s a lot of hype around the young Hungarian keeper, but he’s clearly one for the future rather than present.",
      "",
      "87) Tom McGill (Brighton)\nThe Canadian keeper has been with Brighton since he was 14 and signed a contract extension this summer that will mean he’s spent almost half his life at Brighton if he sees it out. Has never played a first-team game for them.",
      "",

      "",
      "84) Brandon Austin (Tottenham)\nDid himself no harm when called upon on occasion in the depths of Tottenham’s injury hell last season, but very much third choice behind Guglielmo Vicario and Antonin Kinsky at this time. That he was also the only fit and available first-team-adjacent player at Spurs who wasn’t named in Thomas Frank’s first Premier League matchday squad is definitely nothing to worry about.",

      "",
      "75) Gabriel Slonina (Chelsea)\nA Club World Cup winner despite not yet playing a senior game for Chelsea, but no goalkeeper on the Blues’ books can be without a chance. It is a position where Chelsea have enormous breadth but no actual depth.",

      "74) Lewis Dobbin (Aston Villa)\nOne of last season’s entirely normal and unremarkable late June transfers between clubs in PSR strife and there was absolutely nothing to see here. Has yet to play a game for Aston Villa and that’s unlikely to change this season or, very possibly, ever. Spent last season on loan at West Brom and then Norwich, and another Championship loan is surely on the cards.",

      "71) Romain Faivre (Bournemouth)\nLeft Lyon for the south coast in the summer of 2023 but has still spent far more time in France than England since then after loans at Lorient and Brest. Has made only five brief substitute appearances in the Premier League and doesn’t appear likely to add to those any time soon.",

Spent last season on loan with Rio Ave in Portugal, and a permanent return has been touted and seems a win all round.",
      "",
      "52) Harry Amass (Man United)\nWas even left out of the U21 side as United seek to secure a loan for a player they’ve been clear is not available for permanent transfer. There is interest from the Championship, but United appear in no rush to push Amass out the door.",

      "27) Owen Bevan (Bournemouth)\nHighly-rated Wales U21 centre-back has seen injuries hamper his progression to the first team, whether that’s at Bournemouth themselves or somewhere else on loan. If he stays fit, could yet get a chance this season given the way pretty much Bournemouth’s entire defence was picked off in the summer.",

      "",
      "24) Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\nThe club activated a contract extension last season, but with Lascelles having now apparently slipped to, at best, fifth-choice centre-back it wouldn’t be a huge shock to see Newcastle’s longest-serving current player moved on over the next 10 days.",
      "",
      "23) Reiss Nelson (Arsenal)\nArsenal would like to sell him, Fulham would like to have him back. Should be simple, but the Cottagers favour another loan for an injury-prone player entering the final two years of his contract while Arsenal would prefer something more permanent. It screams loan-with-option on September 1, frankly.",
      "",
      "22) Mike Tresor (Burnley)\nRestricted to one substitute appearance in the FA Cup across the whole of last season. It’s just never quite happened for the winger at Turf Moor and having been prominently involved in pre-season was nowhere to be seen in the matchday squad at Tottenham, suggesting a departure over the next couple of weeks is surely the likely outcome here.",
      "",
      "21) Ethan Pinnock (Brentford)\nHas seen it all across six years at Brentford and you’d imagine he remains a welcome familiar sight after a summer of upheaval and flux for the Bees. Played 32 matches in Brentford’s first Premier League season, then 30, 29 and 22 in the subsequent three. No great surprise to see those numbers continue on that trend this season, but he was still on the bench for every game he was available last term.",

Chelsea’s transfer policy is not his fault, and he’s another one whose wildly generous contract terms make him extremely awkward to shift no matter how surplus to requirements he becomes.",
      "",
      "19) Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nDoes appear among the more shiftable of the 25/26 Chelsea bomb squad. Spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and there must surely be a Premier League suitor out there that works for all parties. Also not one of the Chelsea outcasts on the very daftest money, putting him within the wage structure of most non-crazy Premier League clubs. Most obviously and necessarily Bournemouth given the scale of their defensive losses this summer.",
      "",
      "18) Albert Sambi Lokonga (Arsenal)\nSevilla didn’t take up the option to make his loan permanent at the end of last season, so Lokonga is back in career limbo. They’re not Man United-level, but Arsenal are low-key bad at getting fringe players out the door.",

      "15) Jadon Sancho (Man United)\nEverything appears to be agreed with Roma for a loan-with-obligation, and we’re not quite sure what Sancho is waiting for as his ill-fated United career meanders to an acrimonious close. We should all be hacked off at this waste of an obvious talent, but not sure where exactly Sancho can reasonably now direct his own ire without asking himself uncomfortable questions.",

      "14) Konstantinos Tsimikas (Liverpool)\nNow behind Milos Kerkez as well as Andy Robertson in the left-back pecking order at Anfield, with Fulham, Leeds and Nottingham Forest all keen to offer him a more straightforward route to Premier League minutes, but he could yet be retained at Liverpool for squad depth purposes.",
      "",
      "13) Tyrell Malacia (Man United)\nPart of the bloated United Bomb Squad, but not perhaps a villain in the same way as certain other members of that cohort. Malacia’s crime, such as it is, is to be not quite good enough. He also wasn’t quite good enough for PSV, where he spent the second half of last season on loan.",

      "11) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nLooks certain to join the Brighton exodus; the only question is where, for how long, and/or for how much. The list of clubs reportedly interested is a long and glamorous one with Spurs, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Roma and also, in fairness, Leeds, West Ham and Forest all credited with interest of some sort or other in the Argentine playmaker this summer.",

      "",
      "7) Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nFulham, Porto, Fenerbahce and Real Betis have all been linked but no solution appears imminent for the Ukrainian as he enters the final year of his Arsenal contract.",

      "6) Rasmus Hojlund (Man United)\nErik Ten Hag continues to haunt Manchester United, apparently closing off one exit route for Hojlund by selling Victor Boniface to one-time Hojlund-suitors Milan. Surely someone somewhere must want a striker who doesn’t really score goals but runs about a bit while secretly being far taller than you expect.",
      "",
      "5) Ben Chilwell (Chelsea)\nA member of last year’s bomb squad and back hanging around the training ground after Crystal Palace opted against making his loan move permanent. Genuinely quite daft from all concerned this hasn’t been sorted out more swiftly and permanently.",
      "",
      "4) Patrick Bamford (Leeds)\nHas been told he is not in Daniel Farke’s plans and is free to find a new club with just a year left on his contract. Leeds’ understandable concerns around Bamford’s injury history are nevertheless slightly dented by signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin as his direct replacement.",

      "3) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\n‘We’ve made a decision that he’s not available after a very disrupted pre-season,’ was future-Sporcle-scupperer Keith Andrews’ statement ahead of the Nottingham Forest game. “I’ve been very clear on the situation as head coach: I want Yoane in the building.” But not, at this time, on the pitch. Has probably played his last game for the club.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nNo shame in being unable to shift William Saliba or Gabriel Magalhaes from the starting XI, but slipping behind Cristhian Mosquera and out of the full-strength matchday squad altogether might sharpen Kiwior’s focus on finding a new club. Although, funnily enough, also didn’t make the matchday squad on the opening day last season, before being in every single one of the remaining 37, so maybe it’s fine actually.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle)\nWe’ve scoured the internet and can find no mention of Isak anywhere, meaning his absence from the opening-day draw with Aston Villa is a complete mystery. Perhaps some things man is not meant to know.",

      "Manchester United reportedly asked for an evolving Chelsea star in negotiations over the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to the London club.",
      "United have attempted to shift some players off the books who are surplus to requirements this summer. They got Marcus Rashford out on loan, to Barcelona, but the likes of Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are still at the club.",
      "Should they sell each of those players, they should make a decent sum of money, to potentially but some new talent.",
      "They have also been looking into a midfield signing since improving their attack, but the lack of available funds has hindered their pursuit of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, while Crystal Palace don’t want to sell Adam Wharton.",
      "But United have looked for a solution which solves both of their problems. They have been negotiating with Chelsea for some time over the potential sale of Garnacho.",
      "The Red Devils want £50million, while their Premier League rivals don’t want to pay more than £30million.",
      "But to potentially bring the price down and add a midfield star to their ranks, transfer insider Ben Jacobs has suggested that United asked for Andrey Santos.",
      "He said on The United Stand: “What I can tell you is that when discussions have been ongoing for Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, Andrey Santos has been spoken about.",
      "“I don’t think it’s going to lead anywhere, because Chelsea don’t want to sell. That’s another player, though, that Manchester United appreciate. It’s nothing more than that at this stage.”",
      "It is unsurprising that Chelsea don’t want to lose Santos. After going out on loan to Strasbourg last season, where he scored 10 Ligue 1 goals and assisted four more, he played four times in the Club World Cup for the Blues in the summer, assisting once, and came off the bench in this season’s Premier League opener.",
      "Reports earlier in the summer suggested that West Ham had approached Chelsea over the potential £45million transfer of Santos, but were turned away as Enzo Maresca’s side see a lot of promise in the Brazilian midfielder.",
      "That will leave United sweating that they’ll have to let Garnacho go to Stamford Bridge for a cut-price fee, as Ruben Amorim doesn’t want him, needs cash, and currently Chelsea are the only side who are in for him, but won’t budge.",
      "A recent report has stated the Red Devils have given Tottenham the green light to make an approach for Garnacho, as drumming up some extra interest might mean the winger’s price rises and Chelsea don’t get an easy deal.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working to finalise the signing’ of Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho amid a ‘discreet offer’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed his clear “feeling” on Alejandro Garnacho’s situation at Manchester United amid interest from Chelsea.",

      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",

      "With Manchester United, there is hardly ever a middle ground but instead an ever expanding extremes of a scale",
      "Let me explain.",
      "Last season, United had a clear problem with their goalscoring and build-up play - that was simply highlighted by their 44 goals scored in the Premier League, only three teams scored fewer.",
      "So what did United do in this window? They spent around £200m on addressing that problem with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After a positive first performance of the season in their defeat to Arsenal - much of the conversation has now been centred around the opposite end of the pitch with the goalkeeping department the latest area to be under focus after what seemed to be a mistake by Altay Bayindir against Mikel Arteta's side.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted in his first news conference of the season that he learned a lot last season. This included realising just how much he needs to protect his side from the amount of noise around the club on a weekly basis.",
      "\"For me, the only way to protect myself and my players it to tell them not to see anything.",
      "\"You have to be like a monk, especially when you have problems and then I try to present the facts because sometimes there is a narrative that is not true.",
      "\"Altay made one mistake, but last year he had very good performances, so I try to tell that to the players and then try to battle that narrative.",
      "\"But in the end, it's with the players, they have to enjoy their life, go to work, enjoy their family and try not to see anything on the TV or on the internet.\"",
      "Many of the players have highlighted that they feel the vibe and bond around the team has been different.",
      "Yes, there is some hesitancy to believe that after previous managers and false dawns, but there does seem to be genuine optimism after the re-opening of their training ground, new and exciting players joining the club and a positive first performance against Arsenal.",
      "Amorim said: \"Last year, sometimes I was worried going to the games, but now I'm excited, it is completely different.\"",
      "\"We suffered together so much (last season) and that can bond people - the spirit is really good.\"",
      "\"When you feel the team is playing well, you get confident and you feel more free to play and if you feel more free to play, you are happier.",
      "\"If you are happier, your day-to-day is better and it's like a snowball.\"",
      "Amorim's attacking options have been bolstered with Premier League tried and tested Mbeumo and Cunha - both who can play as No 10s or as the main striker to share the load alongside the young Sesko.",
      "The threat they showed against Arsenal, whether it was Cunha's mazy runs or Mbeumo's movements in behind, left fans at Old Trafford with a renewed sense of optimism and Amorim feels the same.",
      "\"We have different options this year, but sometimes football is more than just on the pitch,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"They [Mbeumo and Cunha] are coming in at a moment where the spirit is different, the place is different - sometimes we have a lot of very good players but the scars were there and that influenced the dynamic of the team.",
      "\"They can help us, not just on the pitch but off the pitch too, I feel the guys are more free because they were not here in the very, very difficult moments - they are seeing a different thing.\"",
      "A big component of whether Amorim's United will truly be a \"different thing\" this season could be the young Slovenian Sesko - who Amorim had called 'football obsessed'.",
      "He had already spoken about the potential of Sesko, 22, but I wondered - how exciting can it be for Amorim himself to work and develop a young player like the Slovenian?",
      "Amorim explained: \"When you are in a club like this, you want to have the best players but you also have to imagine the future.",
      "\"That is so exciting - I like to know the players, I like to see the videos of the players and to try to get all the information, but you want that confirmation and I felt Sesko was even better than what I was thinking.",
      "\"I have to be careful, Sesko is going to be our striker for many, many years so we need to put that in his head and let him settle down, to stay calm and enjoy his day because he's really like you said, obsessed.",
      "\"I'm really happy - not just with him but with Cunha, Diego (Leon), and Mbeumo - we know that we have the players and we know that in our future we are going to have that base and that is really important for us.\"",
      "We are only one game into the season, but if United can replicate their performance against Arsenal most weeks, especially without the distraction of European football, it could present a promising opportunity for United to improve on last season's 15th-place finish.",
      "However, United need to earn that optimism from those outside the gates of Carrington and, as Amorim said previously, it is only up to them to fight and change their own narrative.",
      "They will only do that by showing up on the journey rather than focusing on the destination.",
      "\"Success is to win titles, and we don't know if we are going to achieve that (this season),\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We are not in the moment that we can say we are clearly fighting for the league - we just need to get the small steps and the small steps is to prepare every game like it's a final.",
      "\"We want to be really competitive, trying to dominate games, trying to score goals and not get our fans bored to see our games… so if we have the small things and we put check, check, check - in the end, it's going to be better.",
      "\"I think everyone knows that we have a goal - not for this season but in three years to win the Premier League title.",
      "\"We are going to do these steps to reach that goal, but in this club, you know that every week the narrative is going to be different so we need to be prepared for that, block the noise, do the job and try to win games.\""

      "Matheus Cunha arrives with the usual broad smile, introduces himself to everyone for the interview, and starts to casually chat about football.",
      "It takes a few minutes to start recording - you don't want to interrupt his excitement when he starts a conversation. The big news on TV of Eberechi Eze's impending move to Arsenal, his first few weeks at Manchester United, tactical challenges - all even before our crew press 'record'. Cunha's vibrant personality is the first impression you'll get of him.",
      "\"But when I go to the pitch, I always know why I'm here. I always think back at all the hard things that built me to be this guy. These kinds of things cannot play against me, they need to play with me. I always try to manage the psychology. It's not easy! But I always try.\"",
      "The energy and fire Cunha shows on the pitch helped to produce a good debut for Manchester United against Arsenal, when he produced four shots and four dribbles and was arguably their best player. Enough to excite fans and brush away concerns from some, whose eyebrows were raised when he signed due to his recent disciplinary record.",
      "Last season, for Wolves, he missed out on five games across two different suspensions. The first, a two-game ban, after he was found to have acted in an \"improper manner\" following an altercation with a member of Ipswich staff after a match in December.",
      "The same charge followed in March, earning another three matches on the sidelines after lashing out at defender Milos Kerkez three times in an FA Cup game with Bournemouth.",
      "What does he think to people who say he has a temper? \"Honestly, I don't really care about it,\" he replies. \"I think every single thing I did in the game is out of love for the game.",
      "\"I'm very passionate to win games, to make my team and myself better to achieve things. I think inside of me I always believe in something more.",
      "\"And when I bring this to United now, it's something that pushes me forward. Of course we can make mistakes, and I made some mistakes. I am sorry, I apologise for that. But it's always with a good intention.",
      "\"I always try to do something good, and maybe pass a little bit (he means 'to go overboard'). I never put myself in [positions to make people] question my character, because inside I know who I am.\"",
      "When asked if he is the type of player who likes to play on the edge, he is quick to respond: \"Yes, honestly. Everyone talks about the pressure in this club, but I've always wanted to be here.",
      "\"Of course, I understand it's one of the biggest clubs in the world. The pressure is big, but I always try to feel the pressure like a privilege. I always dreamed to come here, and then when I'm here, I can't have this excuse of the pressure being too much, you know. It's a privilege.\"",
      "We are at the reception of Manchester United's renovated training ground. Right behind us sit replicas of some of the most important trophies the club has won - a club he watched back in Brazil when he was a kid.",
      "\"I try not to look around at the trophies\", he laughs. \"I hope I can build my story here with these players.\"",
      "It has been a long path already for the 26-year-old. One of the difficulties he mentioned that helped shape his personality was leaving Brazil so early to become a professional footballer.",
      "At the age of 18, after playing at the academy for Coritiba FC, he was scouted by Sion and moved to Switzerland to sign his first pro contract. Spells at RB Leipzig, Hertha Berlin and Atletico Madrid followed, until he joined Wolves in 2023.",
      "European football shaped him as a player, and he says it helped him develop more tactical awareness and invest in his physicality. As a kid, he played mostly as a No 10, but during his career he also had successful spells as a striker.",
      "His versatility, alongside his goalscoring record, attracted Man Utd, and he seems pleased to play as one of Ruben Amorim's No 10s.",
      "\"It's something that Ruben, when he brought me here, chatted a lot about,\" he reveals. \"I think my perfect position to play is around the middle, a little bit between the midfield and the striker.",
      "\"So, a No 10, I think this is the position that is easier to understand, behind the forward, where you can create much more space. This is the position they brought me here for, it is somewhere I feel comfortable, and I hope I can bring some creativity to the team.\"",
      "During his period in Europe, he also worked on his language skills. Besides his native Portuguese, there is English, Spanish, French, as well as a little bit of German and Italian - five in total, because: \"If you put my German and my Italian together, it counts as only one!\"",
      "They are of course important tools to communicate with team-mates and a respectable list of managers, including Julian Nagelsmann, Ralf Rangnick and Diego Simeone.",
      "He always speaks warmly about Gary O'Neil at Wolves and how he helped him to develop in different positions. Then there is Amorim, who played an important role in his move to Manchester.",
      "\"Ruben is someone that helped me a lot to come here, explaining how my position would be, how I can bring him something that he wants,\" he says. \"I feel very adapted, very comfortable. He's someone who always pushes me forward.",
      "\"I love having someone to push me a little bit more. We never fight, but we have, like, some conversations when I say something, and then they says 'no, it's this way' and I understand and go forward!",
      "\"He's someone who can push the players forward, and I think this is the best quality in a manager. Put players in positions and show everyone their qualities.\"",
      "After the interview, Matheus hangs around chatting again for a few good minutes. Bruno Fernandes shows up and joked with the new signing. He then stops to talk to more people in the training ground before leaving and turning his attention again to Fulham, this Sunday.",
      "Smiling, joking, and looking comfortable on and off the pitch hoping to bring fire, energy and goals to this Manchester United.",

      "🔴 Mbeumo's running power🔄 O'Riley to replace Joao Pedro? 🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United face Fulham on Super Sunday hoping to build on the positives from their narrow loss to Arsenal. Bryan Mbeumo's performance was one of them. His debut, following a strong pre-season, underlined his potential to transform their attack.",
      "It could be seen in his very first actions of the game.",
      "Inside the opening minute, Mbeumo controlled a looping clearance in his own half then drove Manchester United deep into Arsenal territory on the break. Soon afterwards, he was latching onto a Bruno Fernandes through-ball and testing David Raya.",
      "Manchester United ended up dominating possession against one of the Premier League's top teams for the first time in a decade. It was when attacking quickly and directly, though, that they looked most dangerous. Matheus Cunha helped but Mbeumo was key.",
      "Last season, Manchester United directed a far higher percentage of attacks down the left than the right but the emphasis switched completely against Arsenal as they looked for Mbeumo at every opportunity. The former Brentford winger is their outlet now.",
      "He finished the game having had more shots than any other player. He ranked top for touches in the opposition box and dribbles too. But it is his movement that makes it all possible.",
      "Mbeumo made more attacking runs than anyone else in the division at Brentford last season and he occupied the same spot in the rankings on the opening weekend of the new campaign.",
      "The 26-year-old has given Manchester United a new level of running power. His total of 30 attacking runs in his very first appearance for the club was only bettered by Manchester United players on five occasions in the whole of last season in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim has said since his appointment last year that he wants his side to have more possession and thereby more control. But increasing their threat on the counter and on transitions is also seen as crucial. It is already clear that Mbeumo makes it possible.",
      "Against Arsenal, Manchester United totalled four direct attacks and three fast breaks, a combined total beaten only by Liverpool and Bournemouth on the opening weekend and a significant increase on the side's averages under Amorim last season.",
      "The trouble, of course, was that they were unable to make them count. The next challenge is to find a ruthless edge, starting at Craven Cottage. But Mbeumo's impact is evident, even after one game. Manchester United have glimpsed what they can become.",
      "Matt O'Riley assumed penalty-taking duties for Brighton against Fulham last weekend following Joao Pedro's departure to Chelsea. Playing in the No 10 role vacated by the Brazilian, he offered a similar level of off-the-ball industry too.",
      "His total of 66 pressures in the 1-1 draw with Marco Silva's side was the eighth-highest among Premier League players on the opening weekend. Crucially, O'Riley offered quality as well as quantity. No player made more pressures leading to turnovers. His industry helped create opportunities for Brighton to hurt Fulham.",
      "Fabio Hurzeler praised his all-round contribution afterwards. \"He is doing a lot of work out of possession, so we are not only happy to have him because of the goal,\" he said. The Brighton boss will hope for more of the same from him against Everton on Super Sunday.",
      "Injuries made it difficult for O'Riley to showcase those physical qualities anything like as much as he would have liked in his first season at Brighton following his £25m arrival from Celtic last year. He was limited to only 11 starts in the Premier League.",
      "But despite interest from Italian clubs Napoli, Atalanta and Roma this summer, the early evidence this season suggests the club would be wise to keep hold of him as they adapt to life without his former team-mate, off the ball as well as on it.",
      "Nottingham Forest have lost Anthony Elanga but they have gained Dan Ndoye. The 24-year-old marked his debut with a goal against Brentford and could cause Crystal Palace problems next.",
      "The opening column of the season featured analysis of Martin Zubimendi's Arsenal role, Matheus Cunha's potential to help Patrick Dorgu thrive, and Ismaila Sarr's value to Crystal Palace.",

      "Tuesday 19 August 2025 12:54, UK",
      "Paul Merson gives his verdict on the opening weekend of the season, including a \"vital\" win for Arsenal at Man Utd and Man City's \"impressive\" rout of Wolves.",
      "In his exclusive column for skysports.com, the Magic Man also gives his thoughts on United's goalkeeper issues, Tottenham's start under Thomas Frank and Chelsea's lack of cutting edge in front of goal...",
      "The name of the game is winning.",
      "Old Trafford is a difficult place to go, especially on the opening weekend, but Arsenal found a way to win.",
      "They will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.",
      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",
      "But advantage Arsenal. The way I see it now is Liverpool and Man City have to go to Old Trafford to win to match Arsenal, and that's a huge positive at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Special mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.",
      "There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.",
      "If he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.",
      "No-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.",
      "It's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.",
      "The win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.",
      "I know it wasn't the hardest game in Wolves, but winning away from home 4-0 on the opening day of the Premier League is no mean feat.",
      "It was the result of the weekend for me because no-one on Soccer Saturday mentioned them as title winners. Everyone is on Liverpool or Arsenal but the performance from City was a wake-up call for everyone.",
      "There will be bigger tests to come for them, that's for sure, starting on Saturday against Spurs, but they were very impressive.",
      "It is rare in football that a club wins a league title, a Champions League, a Euros or a World Cup without a solid goalkeeper.",
      "You have to have a good goalkeeper because they save you points. David Raya won Arsenal points on Sunday, Alisson Becker does it continually for Liverpool and Ederson has done it through the years at Man City.",
      "Altay Bayindir has lost Man Utd points already with that error against Arsenal. It was a big mistake, a critical mistake in the end.",
      "I can't emphasise how important a top goalkeeper is to a football club and Man Utd have to now react before the transfer window closes.",
      "Apart from that error, Man Utd did alright against Arsenal.",
      "I was impressed with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo but there is still plenty they need to work on to improve as a cohesive unit.",
      "Add in a fit and firing Benjamin Sesko and they will definitely cause plenty of teams problems, but there is still plenty to solve for Ruben Amorim.",
      "They played as well as they could against Arsenal but still lost the game. That's not the best sign for a team.",
      "I still can't see them not being around the middle of the table come the end of the season without further improvement before the transfer window closes.",
      "Chelsea were not good against Crystal Palace. The draw was worrying.",
      "If Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea.",
      "Palmer is now the talk of the town in team talks up against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea. Stop Cole Palmer will be the message for West Ham on Friday. That's just how it is.",
      "He needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.",
      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",
      "I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.",
      "That was a must-win game against Burnley. I expected it to be a bit tighter so credit to Spurs for that, but it would have been a shock had they not got all three points at the weekend.",
      "It was a good result, but the acid test is still to come. Let's see how they perform at Man City at the weekend and then we can start to make a judgement.",
      "People were going mad about the PSG performance but there's still a long way to go for Spurs.",
      "It wasn't hard for Thomas Frank to change things up considering what came before. Ange Postecoglou's Spurs were so open, as open as you can ever seem from a football manager and team, so it wasn't going to take much to adjust.",
      "You don't need to be Albert Einstein to work out how to play against PSG. You need as many defenders as you can on the pitch. Then, against Burnley, you need as many attackers on the pitch as you can to keep causing them problems.",
      "A lot of Tottenham fans have been on already saying this is it, but the acid test is against Man City this weekend and he can set up to stop Pep Guardiola's side playing.",
