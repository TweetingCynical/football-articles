      "Noussair Mazraoui says Manchester United can be proud of their season if they win the Europa League – despite their shocking Premier League form. United have suffered their worst season of the Premier League era, with Ruben Amorim's under-performing side down in 16th place, after 18 defeats this season.",
      "But United can still salvage something from their otherwise miserable season by beating Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao. As well as lifting the trophy, the winners will also go straight into next season's Champions League, which is worth up to £100million in revenue.",
      "And although their domestic form has been pitiful, Mazraoui claimed that will largely be forgotten if Amorim's players are victorious against Spurs. “Winning a trophy is never easy,” said Mazraoui.",
      "“I think in any case you don't downgrade that, because you have to fight hard to get into the position to win a trophy. You have to beat opponents who are strong and who are also really hungry to be in that final.",
      "“When you look back at your career, you will look back at this season and you're going to be proud of winning the Europa League, if we win on Wednesday, more than you're going to look at the failure in the Premier League. You can be sure, for sure, you can be proud.”",
      "In contrast to losing almost half of their Premier League games this season, United are the only team that started out in the Europa League or Champions League to remain unbeaten. It is something United defender Mazraoui cannot explain.",
      "“That's something really tough to say, because we always manage in the Europa League to eventually win,” said the Morocco international. “I think the biggest example was Lyon, where we were almost dead in the last 10 minutes of the game. Extra-time, everybody's tired and everything, and you still manage to win.",
      "“I think one of the biggest differences in the Europa League and the Premier League for us this season is how to manage to win. We maybe have that kind of fighting spirit in the Europa League that we maybe lack in the Premier League.”",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "Mazraoui was signed by former United manager Erik ten Hag, who made way for current boss Amorim whose forthright and straight-talking approach has been welcomed by the defender. “I like him a lot in that respect,” said Mazraoui.",
      "“He's really honest, really straightforward, he's not hiding from anything. That's how I am as well. I'm not hiding behind anything and that's the manager as well.",
      "“He takes responsibility, he knows he's the head of the club eventually, because he's the manager. That's something I like a lot about him.”",
      "Tottenham have beaten United on all three occasions they have met this season, but Mazraoui claimed that will have no bearing on the outcome of Wednesday's make-or-break showdown.",
      "“I don't think so, because this is a whole different competition,” said Mazraoui. “It's the Europa League, it's a final, so the context around it is so different that you can't really compare any previous games with this final.",
      "“Tottenham bring a lot of intensity in their games. We've seen that already this season. That's their biggest quality - they bring so much intensity and pressing in everything they do.”"

      "Roy Keane has never been far removed from Manchester United almost 20 years after his controversial Old Trafford exit. The iconic midfielder won 13 major honours during his 12 years at the club, and is regularly seen assessing United games as a pundit.",
      "Despite his legacy at the club, Keane agreed to leave by mutual consent in November 2005, stemming from comments made on MUTV about his team-mates following a heavy defeat to Middlesbrough. Two decades later, he pulled no punches as United, who sit 16th in the Premier League, continued to fall well below his standards.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.” Here’s a closer look at how Keane’s relationship with United has altered over the years.",
      "Keane has spoken extensively about his shock exit from United. The former captain would end his career at Celtic, but the club’s decision had a long-term impact on Keane’s relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "The Irishman was known as a tough-tackling midfielder with a hardman persona on the pitch. However, when speaking on the Stick to Football podcast in February, he admitted the emotional toll that it took on him: \"When I left United, I did cry that morning. Cried in my car,” Keane said.",
      "It was not the first time Keane had reflected on the raw emotion that came with his departure from United. “I think the only time I really cried was when I left United after I had a bit of a disagreement with a few people, but other than that you're very much in that bubble,\" Keane previously told Tommy Tiernan.",
      "\"You're in the zone. I always say I was in the zone. I used to say to people, and they didn't quite understand it, I was going to war every week.\"",
      "The manner of his exit meant that Keane had a different view of the club than many of his United team-mates, despite being crucial to the glory that they achieved under Ferguson. However, almost 18 years later, Keane shocked supporters by appearing in the reveal video for United’s third kit in 2023.",
      "A joint statement from the club and kit manufacturer said: “Manchester United and Adidas are proud to work with Roy Keane, one of the club’s most iconic and popular former players. Roy won 17 trophies with Manchester United, his fearless playing style and never give up attitude has earned him a special place in the hearts of Manchester United fans around the world.”",
      "Keane has been vocal about United's relative underachievement since Ferguson stepped down as manager in 2013. The 53-year-old has been brutally honest in his assessment of various United players, but former team-mate Mikael Silvestre feels that the club can use Keane’s feedback to their advantage, and backed him to join current boss Ruben Amorim’s staff in an advisory role",
      "“I think it would be great for Roy Keane to play a role at Manchester United,” Silvestre told Yaysweepstakes.com. “Because, the thing is with Roy, he always treated everybody exactly the same way. It didn’t matter if you were a new signing, an old guy, the manager, everybody.",
      "\"That's how he got respect. That's how Sir Alex got respect. If you treat everybody the same, no problem. I think it’s a bit of a problem with this generation of players. They find criticism harder to take.",
      "\"If Roy Keane was involved at Manchester United, if he was on the inside with the group, he would have to protect and work for the group. You wouldn’t see him criticising players in public, so there wouldn't be any issue.”",
      "Ex-United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer agreed with Silvestre and saw the value in the expertise that Keane could pass on to his squad. In 2019, Solskjaer invited Keane to the club’s Carrington training ground to speak to the players, four years before he would feature in the kit reveal video.",
      "In terms of how the meeting unfolded, a source told the Mirror: “As you’d imagine, Roy has strong views on what it takes to be a proper United player, and he gave it to them straight.",
      "“He wasn’t impressed with one player who didn’t seem to be all that interested and looked as if he’d rather be somewhere else. But for the majority, it was a fascinating snapshot into the hunger and desire that drove Roy during his time at the club.”",
      "Keane may have reached some form of truce with United in recent years, but that has not prevented him from sharing his thoughts on the current hierarchy. Before Erik ten Hag was replaced by Amorim this season, Keane suggested that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and those in charge of football operations had undermined the Dutch coach by changing his backroom staff.",
      "\"I'm not saying he's not a good manager or he hasn't got good coaching staff, but in the summer they changed all the coaching staff,” Keane argued on the Stick to Fooball podcast. “So you're on about a manager having a bit of power and control of the football club – I'll bet you Ten Hag's got none of that!",
      "\"So players will look at the manager and go, 'Well, all your staff went in the summer. I didn't see you fighting for any of them. You're bringing more staff in.' I just think it looks chaotic, doesn't it?\"",
      "Keane has been frequently touted for the United job, despite last managing Ipswich Town in 2011. There was speculation that he could follow in the footsteps of United legends Solskjaer, Ryan Giggs, and Michael Carrick by taking charge on an interim basis. However, Keane quickly shut down the suggestion, having already critiqued the manager’s lack of power at the club.",
      "\"They're not gonna be asking me. They just wouldn't... they just wouldn't,” Keane told Arsenal great Ian Wright. When asked about the possibility of taking over at Old Trafford on a short-term basis, Keane said: \"I'm not leaving you, Wrighty.“"

      "Ruben Amorim is working out his best line-up to beat Spurs in Bilbao, with the United boss considering dropping Hojlund on the bench.",
      "The return of Amad from injury has given Amorim greater attacking options and the United boss is said to be considering starting him against Spurs.",
      "That could see Hojlund displaced from the starting line-up, with captain Bruno Fernandes potentially playing as a false nine, supported by Amad and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Another option, which Amorim has already tried this season, would be to play Kobbie Mainoo as a false nine, with Fernandes deployed deeper.",
      "Amorim has yet to decide on his starting line-up, with three training sessions left before the £100million make-or-break showdown in Spain, with the winners earning a place in next season's Champions League.",
      "But Amorim is keen to retain the central midfield partnership of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte, which proved effective in the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the Europa League.",
      "Ex-Red Devils boss Roy Keane delivered a scathing assessment of Hojlund in the wake of the Chelsea defeat, United's 18th in the league this season.",
      "Keane said: \"They've got no striker. Hojlund looked like he'd just come out of the academy. His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play. Again, if you're a striker playing for United - even for the whole team - one shot on target?'",
      "\"We keep making excuses for him. We talk about confidence, but you still think, when you're a striker, you have to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"What the big clubs have - and what United have always had - is strikers who can produce something for themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they have quality, a bit of determination, a bit of experience, football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund.\""

      "Wayne Rooney has identified three key signings that could help Manchester United bounce back from their worst-ever Premier League season. And one of them is a return for former goalkeeper David de Gea.",
      "The Red Devils, who have won the Premier League a record 13 times, are currently languishing in 16th place with a record low of 39 points. Their dismal league performances have continued under Ruben Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Despite their chronic struggles in the league, United will salvage Champions League football from the season if they can defeat Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "However, the squad clearly needs a complete overhaul to compete at the highest level domestically and in Europe next season. Rooney, United's all-time leading goalscorer, believes that the addition of his former team-mate De Gea, along with striker Victor Osimhen and defender Marc Guehi, could be the catalyst for a turnaround.",
      "Speaking to Amazon Prime Video Sport, the former England forward said: \"I'd probably sign David de Gea back. I think Manchester United have missed him and I think he could still do a very good job.",
      "\"The second one, I would sign Osimhen. He's a number nine, I think he's a really good striker and possibly available. And the third one, it would be difficult but I'd sign Guehi from Crystal Palace. As a centre-back, I think he would have a really good impact on the club.\"",
      "De Gea enjoyed 12 seasons at Old Trafford, winning the Premier League title once and being crowned United's Player of the Season four times. The 34-year-old was let go in July 2023 and spent nearly a year searching for a new team before joining Fiorentina at the start of this season.",
      "The Spaniard has been a standout performer for the Serie A side, helping them to secure European football while making it to the Europa Conference League semi-finals. He is set to face United in a pre-season match this summer, which will undoubtedly be an emotional encounter for the Spaniard. His replacement, Andre Onana, who was brought in for his superior ball-playing skills, has made numerous high-profile blunders since his £47.2million arrival from Ajax in 2023.",
      "Meanwhile, another United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has made it clear what he thinks the team needs. He said: \"Forget Delap's ability, potential, whatever you want to say about him. It's not about that right now for Man United. I think they need experience in there.",
      "\"Someone who knows how to score and someone that these younger guys can learn off. Rasmus Hojlund needs help. He doesn't need a competitor.\"",
      "England and Crystal Palace defender Guehi is in demand too. The 24-year-old, who has been linked with Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham, will come with a hefty price tag, especially after helping Palace to FA Cup glory against Manchester City."

      "Ruben Amorim's men will jet out to Bilbao this week hoping to beat Premier League rivals Tottenham in a bid to end their disastrous season with silverware, while also catapulting themselves into the Champions League.",
      "However, United come into the final in poor form, having lost five of their last six games in the Premier League and manager Amorim has even questioned whether he is the right man to take the team forward.",
      "But if United are successful in beating Spurs in the showpiece, Amorim will have a much larger budget as part of the lucrative TV money on offer from competing in Europe's elite competition.",
      "Both of the club's transfer wishlists have been curated to put together a squad that will be able to deliver on Amorim's tactical vision - which has so far failed to come to fruition following 13 defeats in 26 games under the Portuguese boss.",
      "There have been some concerns that Amorim may walk out on the team at the end of the season after his brutal comments about the clubs' fortunes.",
      "He infamously claimed his side were \"the worst team in the history of Manchester United\" and also said he was \"embarrassed\" about their situation and they were \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\".",
      "It's understood United will not sack Amorim, even if he loses the Europa League final. There is a feeling that it would be madness to axe him following a taxing campaign that will go down as the worst in United's storied history.",
      "Instead they will give him time to further implement his 3-4-3 system and add more quality to the squad. Liam Delap, Antoine Semenyo and Jonathan David are just some of the names being linked with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But first they have a chance to add some positivity to a wretched season when they fly out to Spain this week. United warmed up for their season-defining clash against Tottenham with a 1-0 loss to Chelsea and played a full-strength side - with Amorim keen to ensure his players are sharp going into the final.",
      "Amorim has been insistent that winning the trophy won't salvage their campaign and believes his team face many issues in the future regardless.",
      "He said: \"Europa League will not change anything in our problems - it's going to help us to have Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.",
      "\"We have to change the minds of our fans with consistency, good decisions, good recruitment, a good academy. This is what we need to change to take this club back to the top. This is more of a shortcut to go to European games. Nothing more.\""

      "Despite going in as underdogs against Manchester City at Wembley Stadium, the Red Devils pulled off a stunning 2-1 victory, courtesy of goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo which overshadowed Jeremy Doku's goal. The win came as a shock to supporters up and down the country and marked the team's sole piece of silverware for the season.",
      "Ratcliffe, who holds a minority stake in United, didn't shy away from acknowledging his team's outsider status but heaped praise on their Wembley performance after the match. \"Manchester United were clearly not the favourites to win today,\" he previously said.",
      "He added: \"But they played with total commitment and skill and overcame one of the great teams in football. We are all very proud of the players and the staff who work tirelessly to support them.\"",
      "However, comments about not being favourites highlighted just how much of an uphill battle Project 150 – which aims to see United win the Premier League by 2028 in line with its 150th anniversary – would be. The club's recent performances, including a record-low eighth-place finish in the 2023/24 season and a dreadful 2024/25 campaign in the Premier League, have highlighted the significant challenges they face in closing the gap with their rivals.",
      "Despite the arrival of head coach Ruben Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, the team continues to languish near the bottom of the table, on track for their worst-ever Premier League finish. And while Amorim has shown glimpses of promise, such as dragging the team to the Europa League final where they face fellow Premier League strugglers Tottenham, it is clear that he needs time to adapt and shape the squad to his playing style.",
      "\"You've got to be brave or foolish to think winning the league by 2028 is doable from where United currently are.\"",
      "It has been 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson departed Manchester United, and the club has struggled to replicate his success in the Premier League since then.",
      "The current state of the team suggests that it will be a long and challenging journey to return to the top of English football. Old Trafford has seen a parade of managers, including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and now Amorim, all attempting to reverse the club's fortunes. But instead, they've seemingly slipped further down the league table.",
      "Another hurdle is the Premier League's PSR rules and regulations. In the January transfer window, United were only able to secure the services of Patrick Dorgu for £25million and promising Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven, while Marcus Rashford, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia were sent out on loan.",
      "If United can arrange permanent moves for these players, and if Chelsea decide to splash out £20m for Jadon Sancho following his loan stint at Stamford Bridge, it could help ease the club's substantial debts. As of March, the club was reported to be in debt to the tune of £733m, with an additional £315m owed in outstanding transfer fees."

      "When Cristiano Ronaldo joined Al Nassr midway through the 2022-23 season, the expiry of his bumper contract was the last thing on most people's minds. Now, though, the imminent end of his deal has left plenty of questions over the Portuguese.",
      "Ronaldo has continued to score for fun in the Saudi Pro League, but hasn't delivered the trophies his current club had hoped for when bringing him in from Manchester United. It's time for the Riyadh side to stick or twist, and Ronaldo's wages may tempt them towards the latter.",
      "Of course, the player himself is far from ready to retire. He remains part of the Portugal international picture, missing just one competitive match in the last 18 months, and has a World Cup on the horizon in 2026.",
      "\"I just want to enjoy. Plan for the retirement… if it has to happen, in one or two years… I don’t know,\" Ronaldo said in 2024. \"I’m turning 40 soon… I really want to enjoy, as long as I feel motivated I keep going. The day I don’t feel motivated, I will retire”.",
      "Upon signing for Al Nassr, Ronaldo indicated he wouldn't be returning to club football in Europe. \"\"I did my mission in Europe well and achieved everything. Now it's time for a new challenge in Asia,\" he said.",
      "The offer of a return to Sporting might change that, though. He was a teenager when he left his home in Madeira to join the Lisbon club, and it's there that he made his senior debut.",
      "Despite a dramatic slump when Ruben Amorim left for Manchester United, Sporting have secured a return to the Champions League. Victory in their final league game will see them crowned champions, and a return for the prodigal son could make for a very interesting summer.",
      "If Ronaldo feels he has settled in Saudi Arabia, Al Ahli might be the solution. Matthias Jaissle's side won the AFC Champions League Elite this season, beating league rivals Al Hilal along the way, and will defend their title next season.",
      "The Jeddah club are also likely to have space in their squad for a big-name arrival over the summer. Roberto Firmino has had an up-and-down time at the club, and is expected to return to Brazil.",
      "A bigger issue, of course, is how Ronaldo might gel with Ivan Toney. The England international has top-scored for the club this term, and much may hinge on whether he feels he needs to return to Europe to earn a chance of making Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad - and wether he cares enough to do that.",
      "Speaking of Premier League stars of yesteryear who have endured goal droughts in so-called 'lesser' leagues... Olivier Giroud joined LAFC from AC Milan last summer, but went 10 league games without scoring in his first half-season.",
      "He opened his MLS account in April, after a couple of strikes in cup competitions, but the return is probably some way short of what the California club would have expected from the Frenchman's elevated Designated Player pay-packet. If they're able to get the veteran off their books, might another elder statesman take his place?",
      "Of course, the biggest selling point of a move for Ronaldo is a chance to reignite his one-time La Liga rivalry with Inter Miami's Lionel Messi, only this time across the Atlantic. It wouldn't be exactly the same as in those Clasico years, but fans who weren't able to witness those matches first-hand may well be pleased just to see the pale imitation.",
      "A Premier League return for Ronaldo remains unlikely, and a third Manchester United stint all but impossible. If he were to return to England, though, Chelsea might be bold or foolish enough to take the plunge.",
      "The Blues' transfer policy has focused predominantly on a younger profile of player, but there have been times this term when a lack of experience was telling. If a near-40-year-old Thiago Silva could do the job last term, why not a 40+ Ronaldo?",
      "We wouldn't even be entertaining the idea if Chelsea had a settled and consistent front-line, but the cupboard looks rather bare when you take out Nicolas Jackson. A summer exit for Christopher Nkunku would free up a bit of space, leaving them with someone ready to step in and share line-leading duties at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Ronaldo's return to Manchester United in 2021 came with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the helm. It might be a long shot, but a reunion with the Norwegian boss at Besiktas could end up tempting Ronaldo this summer.",
      "While Ronaldo found it harder to earn regular minutes under Erik ten Hag, he was United's top scorer in that first season under Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. Besiktas' top scorer this season, Ciro Immobile, only has one more year left on his own deal and missed periods with hamstring trouble earlier in the season, so the Super Lig club may be tempted to see if the funds are there for Ronaldo.",
      "There is, of course, the small matter of the Istanbul side missing out on a top-two finish this term. Would Ronaldo return to Europe without the promise of Champions League football?"

      "The Manchester United full-back, who gave birth to daughter Romy in March, says she will feel “100 per cent anxious” when watching today’s FA Cup final against Chelsea from the stands.",
      "And while Blundell jokes that “it will be nice to have a break” from parenting because Wembley forbids babies from attending, she would much prefer to affect the action.",
      "“It will be strange,” she says. “Watching a game from the stands is so hard, it’s frustrating not being able to help. But I’m really excited to be there. I’m confident in them. On the pitch you can control and influence the game but I won’t be able to do anything. I’ll feel everything a fan does.”",
      "Blundell has been in regular contact with her team-mates as they prepare to defend the trophy they won by defeating Tottenham 4-0 last season.",
      "And she’s already been dropping in at training to work with the medical staff ahead of becoming the first mum to play for United next season.",
      "“I went in this week to do a little bit with the physios and gym stuff but I spoke to the girls and everyone was chilled,” she says, though they are underdogs against her former club and recently crowned league champions.",
      "“With Chelsea they have always had serial winners, even when I was there. They just have that winning mentality to always find a way. But again I’m confident we can get a win. We just need to focus on ourselves and make sure we’ll put in a good performance.”",
      "Being away has left Blundell more motivated than ever and when it is time to return next season she wants to “cherish every moment” – even if it carries a host of unknowns.",
      "She says United have been “very supportive” since the moment she informed the club doctor and later her team-mates having initially faked an injury in the early weeks.",
      "The club quickly activated a 12-month option to extend her contract – which would have expired this summer – and the medical and sports science staff have been speaking to counterparts at other clubs to learn about best practices for returning postpartum.",
      "That includes Arsenal, whose defender Amanda Ilestedt returned in January after giving birth last August.",
      "“It’s still a taboo subject in a sense because there’s not that many (mums in the WSL),” Blundell continues. “But it’s good that everyone can learn from each other to help myself and others coming back in the best physical shape.",
      "“I guess I will in a sense be a role model if it goes well but we can learn from each other and hopefully it can be normalised going forward.”",
      "For now, however, she will be an uneasy spectator as Marc Skinner’s team look to inflict a first domestic defeat of the season on Chelsea.",
      "“This is our third consecutive year (in the final), that’s a massive help,” she says. “The first year we lost, the second we won.",
      "“Most girls have felt both sides of it. You never want to lose but I think we’ve got such characters in the group there is no reason not to be confident.”"

      "“If you’re a striker playing for Man United and you are having one shot on target… we make excuses for him, saying he needs more confidence, but when you are a striker up there, you have to make things happen sometimes.",
      "\"What the big clubs have, what United always had, is strikers who can produce something by themselves because they have quality, desire, determination, a bit of experience, football intelligence. You don’t see it with Hojlund. he needs a little bit of support, but you need to do better.”",
      "One solution for the Red Devils would potentially have been a deal to sign Jonathan David from Lille. The Canadian striker has confirmed that will leave Lille at the end of the season.",
      "Unfortunately, it appears that a couple of their rivals have stolen a march. According to L’Equipe, both Aston Villa and Tottenham have opened talks regarding a free transfer.",
      "There is also apparently interest from Napoli and Juventus. United have been strongly linked in the past."

      "Speaking to Opta in March, Pereira revealed he wants to prove United made a mistake in selling him whenever he plays at Old Trafford. He said: “I don’t think I got my full chance to play and show my quality when I was there. Fulham gave me that opportunity, they did everything for me, and I want to do everything for them.

      "The former Scottish international striker, who spent 11 years at Old Trafford while Sir Alex Ferguson was restoring the standards first laid down by Sir Matt Busby, has warned that until the Reds rediscover their identity then the lifeblood of the club will continue to drain away.",
      "Ruben Amorim is the latest manager to be tasked with getting the Stretford End arising - and McClair believes a comparison can be made between the club he arrived in the summer of 1987 and the one that now finds itself on a precipice.",
      "United will finish in their lowest league position for half a century - yet still have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League by beating Tottenham in Wednesday night’s Europa League Final.",
      "McClair doesn’t accept that Amorim’s fate hinges on the result in Bilbao. But he does feel that the result will have huge ramifications on the time it’s going to take for the glory years to truly return.",
      "“I can’t say I’ve enjoyed watching United this season but the one oasis in the very dry desert has been the Europa League,” said McClair, who joined a club that had not been champions for 20 years when he arrived from Celtic for £800,000 and went on to win four title medals, two FA Cups, the League Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup after Ferguson was handed both time and money.",
      "“I’m even reluctant to say they have played well on the road to the final because I think that they’ve enjoyed a lot of good fortune.",

      "“Qualification for the Champions League is worth upwards of £100million and that will have an effect on both the budget and the quality of the players United will be able to attract.",
      "“Players will always want to come to Manchester United. But can they afford these players if they’re not in the Champions League or will they be forced into a cheaper market?”",
      "McClair became the first United player since George Best to score 20 league goals in a season during his first year at Old Trafford - and Ferguson’s team came second to Liverpool.",
      "But the next two campaigns saw the Reds finish 11th and 13th as the Scot sold fan favourites like Norman Whiteside and Paul McGrath in a ruthless cull that McClair believes has echoes of the way Amorim has made it clear that players like Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are finished.",
      "Winning the FA Cup in 1990 and the European Cup Winners Cup a year later became the springboard for an unparalleled period of United success. McClair said: “There are definitely comparisons to be made between now and what happened when Fergie arrived.",
      "“Defeats, lowly league positions - and then a welcome cup run to a final. In 1990, it was the FA Cup. Now it’s the Europa League. What also intrigues me is the way Amorim has gone about restoring discipline inside the dressing room.",
      "“He’s been very candid about what he thinks. He’s made it clear that he’s in charge and that he will set the tone. I can see comparisons to Fergie in the way that Amorim is imposing his authority on the club.”",
      "McClair added: “Manchester United’s DNA is all about class, humility and dignity. It goes all the way back to when Sir Matt Busby took over after the Second World War. Players, managers and staff have a responsibility, irrespective of whether the club is having success or not, to be an ambassador for certain values.",
      "“The fabric of United has been lost since Alex Ferguson left and I suspect that Amorim recognises that and is doing what’s needed to restore things that used to be non-negotiable.",
      "“Fergie made it clear that you had to be special to play for Manchester United. That meant being a good player, or course, but he also made it clear that you had to be someone who was capable of carrying the mantle of all that history.”",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe made the tough decision to sack Erik ten Hag last year despite high praise from Pep Guardiola. Ten Hag led United to a stunning 2-1 victory over arch-rivals Manchester City in the 2024 FA Cup final thanks to goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Guardiola, impressed by United's tactical prowess in overcoming his formidable City team, didn't hold back in his admiration for Ten Hag. Speaking after the game, Guardiola said: \"He's a lovely person and an extraordinary manager.",
      "\"Winning the FA Cup is important for them like last season it was for us.\" Yet, despite the FA Cup triumph, Ten Hag's tenure at United was marred by a disappointing league campaign.",
      "The Red Devils finished an unprecedented eighth in the Premier League in the 2023/24 season, managing only 18 victories in 38 games, and were also knocked out of the League Cup by Newcastle in the fourth round. In the Champions League, Ten Hag's squad failed to progress past the group stage, finishing last behind Bayern Munich, Copenhagen, and Galatasaray, with just one win in six matches.",
      "Despite nearly £200million spent on players such as Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, Leny Yoro, and Noussair Mazraoui, Ten Hag found it difficult to change the team's fortunes as the 2024/25 season began. The 55-year-old managed only three victories from the first nine matches of the season before being dismissed following a 2-1 defeat to West Ham United in October.",
      "Despite Guardiola's glowing endorsement, Ratcliffe evidently felt that Ten Hag wasn't the right person to restore United's former glory - he even later confessed that it was an error to let him stay on after the FA Cup win. Ruben Amorim took over as manager of the club the following month, with supporters in the northwest anticipating great things from the highly successful former Sporting CP strategist.",
      "However, some argue that the 49-year-old Portuguese maestro has performed worse than Ten Hag in his final season. As the 2024/25 season draws to a close, the club is on course for another record-low finish, while also failing to progress beyond the fifth round of the FA Cup and the quarter-finals of the League Cup.",
      "Despite this, Amorim could still secure the Europa League title, with the Red Devils set to face Tottenham Hotspur in the European competition's final on Wednesday. A victory would not only significantly improve the team's overall performance in 2024/25 but also secure them a spot in next season's Champions League.",
      "However, further investment from the board will be required, as Amorim continues to struggle to adapt the squad he inherited from Ten Hag to his style of play, with United lagging far behind their rivals. Meanwhile, Guardiola is aiming to make amends for last year and guide Manchester City to an eighth FA Cup on Saturday afternoon, with The Cityzens set to face Crystal Palace at Wembley.",
      "If successful, it would mark the third time Guardiola has led the team to the trophy, and it would be his 19th piece of silverware with the side, including Premier Leagues, domestic and European titles, Super Cups, and Club World Cups. Conversely, a victory for Palace would represent the London club's first triumph in the tournament.",
      "The Eagles have notably reached the final of the competition twice before, falling short against Manchester United in 1990 and again in 2016."

      "Olly kicked his hit-filled setlist with Troublemaker, serenading them through two hours of his best known songs. The pop sensation turned 41 this Wednesday and marked the occasion by belting out a medley of 80s classics, celebrating the era of his birth.",
      "Having come a long way from his days as a cover singer, Olly had fans ecstatic to hear original hits including Heart Skips a Beat and Wrapped Up, alongside the timeless tunes. The gig took an emotional turn when Olly performed Dear Darling.",
      "The poignant track was dedicated to his late friend and X Factor co-presenter, Caroline Flack. Sharing with the audience, he confessed: \"I genuinely think about her every day.\"",
      "He continued: \"I know that feeling of losing someone that you love very much. With this song, I want you to think of those people and sing with me.\"",
      "As thousands of phones illuminated the arena, fans joined in an unforgettable rendition of the 2012 ballad, creating the night's most memorable moment. While this tour marked his 15-year journey in the music industry, Olly gave his fans a sneak peek into his future plans. He performed his new single, 'Save Me', exclusively for the audience, hinting at what's next for him.",
      "Describing the song as the beginning of a \"new Murs era\", it's clear from the crowd's reaction that they're excited about what lies ahead. As he exited the stage to thunderous applause, it's evident that his fans are eagerly anticipating more milestones from Olly, who has firmly established himself as a top-notch performer.",

      "Manchester City players' discussions of an Ibiza holiday prior to the 2024 FA Cup final allegedly lit a fire under Manchester United to win the spectacle last season. That's according to ex-United coach Benni McCarthy, who served as an assistant under Erik ten Hag from 2022 until last summer.",
      "The Manchester derby was on the Wembley stage last season, with Pep Guardiola gunning for the opportunity to claim a Premier League and cup double.",
      "It was also a chance for Ten Hag to earn a trophy for the second consecutive season at Old Trafford, which he achieved with a surprising 2-1 victory.",
      "While City were the overwhelming favourites, considering they recently celebrated an unprecedented fourth league title in a row while finishing 31 points ahead of their city rivals, a pre-match moment among Guardiola's men left the United squad motivated to complete the seemingly improbable task.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Ladbrokes at the launch of Gaffer of all Accas earlier this year, McCarthy said: \"When we went to walk and inspect the pitch, at that moment, the disrespect from the City players kind of played a huge part.",
      "\"You know, when you stand there and you see the players, all little groups of friends here and there, the players are out on the pitch and soaking up the atmosphere. When we walked back towards the dressing room, a lot of the City players were discussing their trips to Ibiza after the game.",
      "\"So in their heads, they've already won the FA Cup and they're already thinking about going to Ibiza and that. I think that kind of infuriated our boys because, mate, we'd got a final to win.",
      "\"We have a final to play, and you lot are talking about your after-party! Almost like in terms of they've already won it, and they are preparing the celebrations for it like they're playing against no opposition. When we got into the dressing room, the players were like, 'These lot are disrespecting us'.",
      "\"So then they, amongst themselves, had a little huddle, and in the huddle they were going at it about the disrespect, you know. I think that's probably what we needed at that time. It just brought the furious side out of us.\"",
      "A year later, City find themselves in their third FA Cup final in a row on Saturday with Crystal Palace standing in their way of ending what has been a disappointing season with a trophy.",
      "Despite a dismal campaign for United, who are resigned to finishing no higher than 13th this season, they can also claim silverware as they take on Tottenham in the Europa League final on Wednesday."

      "Fair play to the very likeable Ruben Amorim for trying to put some sort of positive spin on another Premier League defeat, Manchester United’s 18th of the season. “This performance has helped me a lot to choose the starting 11 for the (Europa League) final,” he said, with a touch of grim humour, no doubt.",
      "And his team selection for the loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge suggested there were one or two players on trial for Bilbao, most notably Mason Mount, who must be under consideration for a starting role against Spurs in Spain. Other players ‘on trial’ must have included Rasmus Hojlund but his trial is a long-running affair.",
      "When you hear the likes of Roy Keane laying into the Danish striker, it is hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for Hojlund. The centre-piece of Keane’s dismantling of the United striker came when he said Hojlund “looked like he had just come out of the academy.”",
      "Brutal. And there is no escaping the startling ineffectiveness of a forward who cost in excess of £70million and only looks as though he is going to score if one hits him and goes in, as it did against Athletic Bilbao recently.",
      "But even if Hojlund appears to have a particularly thick skin, it is tough to see a pile-on, and it might be in the player’s interests to look for an extended spell on loan in Europe next season, to rebuild his confidence. Let’s face it, no-one is going to pay big money for a permanent transfer.",
      "In the meantime, Amorim has a big decision to make, the sort of big decision managers are paid the big bucks for. As the alternatives are very limited, it would seem likely that Hojlund will start, especially as he has been a feature of the run to the final.",
      "But, essentially, on Wednesday, it is a Premier League match, albeit one against a Premier League team that is actually worse than United. And Hojlund is showing nothing that suggests he can hurt Spurs.",
      "Would it be a big call to leave Hojlund out? Not really. Probably not even as big as when Pep Guardiola left Kyle Walker out of the 2023 Champions League final.",
      "Immediately after the loss at Chelsea, there were United fans on social media suggesting Harry Maguire would be a more viable starting option upfront. Maguire will be needed at the back but, such are Hojlund’s struggles, you take the point. And an elite manager is paid to come up with different strategies. Starting Kobbie Mainoo - who seems to have a keener eye for goal than Hojlund - as a false nine would be one.",
      "Wednesday’s final might actually be more significant for Ange Postecoglou than it is for Amorim, who stays at United regardless. But it will still tell us a lot about Amorim and his willingness to make the big, bold decision. It will still tell us a lot about whether Amorim is truly the man for the job."

      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery joked that he expected Manchester United to be beaten by Chelsea on Friday night. Marc Cucurella netted the decisive goal for the Blues late in the second half, heading past Andre Onana and handing United their 18th Premier League loss of the season.",
      "United thought they had taken the lead when Harry Maguire found the back of the net from a Bruno Fernandes cross, but VAR ruled it out for offside. The match ended 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, with Enzo Maresca's Chelsea taking a significant step towards securing Champions League qualification for next season.",
      "Villa are another of the teams in the race to secure a top-five finish, which will see them return to Europe's top competition. And had Amorim's side got a result in West London, Villa's destiny would have been in their own hands.",
      "Emery hinted that he hadn't held out too much hope of that happening, though, with Villa now needing results to go in their favour on the final day.",
      "\"How's it going with Chelsea? ,\" he asked. \"Finished 1-0, okay we expected it\" he said, followed by a cheeky grin and a laugh.",
      "Emery added: \"It's not in our hands. We are winning. But other teams are as well, they are being demanding, and they are getting their points.\"",
      "As for United, they can, somehow, still earn a place in the Champions League, despite being on for their worst domestic finish in more than 50 years. Defeat against Chelsea leaves them in 16th place in the table, but winning the Europa League final vs Spurs would see them return to Europe's elite.",
      "Amorim is not sure that would be beneficial for United's long-term success though, with a huge overhaul of the playing staff required to compete.",
      "Asked if Champions League qualification could hinder his project, he said: “That is my feeling. We need more time with the team. We need to arrange a lot of things in Carrington that we need more time to do, so we’re not thinking game by game by game.",
      "“Then we have the squad. We proved this year that we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and then be really competitive in the Premier League. That is going to be tough. My feeling is that.\""

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and his predecessor Harry Maguire rounded on Alejandro Garnacho during their side's defeat to Chelsea on Friday night. United slipped to a 1-0 reverse at Stamford Bridge.",
      "It was their 18th loss of the season, their third successive defeat and their eighth consecutive Premier League game without a win. That latter feat is a new club record for the embattled Red Devils.",
      "The goal came about after neat play from Chelsea saw the play switched from left to right. The ball ended up with Blues skipper Reece James on the edge of the box, with Garnacho marking him.",
      "James pulled off a piroutte, leaving Garnacho in his wake, before digging out a cross towards the far post. That was where an unmarked Marc Cucurella was waiting to head the ball past Andre Onana.",
      "That proved to be the only goal of the game, with United failing to deliver much in terms of an attacking threat. Garnacho had only just come on in place of Mason Mount and quickly found himself at the ire of his team-mates.",
      "Both Fernandes and Maguire were spotted angrily gesturing to Garnacho after Cucurella's goal. It was the latest low point in what has been a miserable season for the Argentine winger.",
      "He has found himself out of favour since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as manager. This was his second successive Premier League game starting on the bench, having only played 30 minutes in the defeat to West Ham.",
      "It means Garnacho is highly unlikely to start next week's Europa League final against Tottenham. And legendary United skipper Roy Keane has urged Amorim to move on from Garnacho, as well as fellow academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo and striker Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers. The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.\""

      "Noussair Mazraoui has cut out fizzy drinks from his diet, a self-imposed measure. He misses a soft drink at dinner and will treat himself if Manchester United win the Europa League final.",
      "Mazraoui was the most frugal of United’s five summer signings for an up-front fee of £12.8m. He has also been the most effective.",
      "Beyond Bruno Fernandes and Amad, Mazraoui has been the most consistent performer in the United squad. His availability has been so remarkable he required a corrective procedure after experiencing heart palpitations and did not miss a game.",
      "“That's a long time ago, it feels like ages ago,” Mazraoui says. “Everything was just fine. It was like nothing big or huge, nothing mention-worthy.”",
      "Mazraoui knew he had to make adjustments to his conditioning for his maiden season in English football. He feels the benefit, as much as he may miss some fizz. Mazraoui played a minimum of 40 games in only one season before he joined United. He has broken the 50 barrier this season.",
      "Until his breather at Brentford, Mazraoui had started in 13 successive matches. He only managed 15 Bundesliga starts for Bayern last season. In the Premier League, it is more than double that. A trophy would provide a sweet finale for a player who has deprived Mazraoui’s system of sugar.",
      "“To be honest, I'm surprised that you're telling me that I played in seven positions,” Mazraoui says. “I didn't know that.”",
      "You can’t blame Mazraoui for not counting. For those who have been: right centre back, left centre back, right back, left back, right wing, left wing and, most curiously, as the No.10.",
      "Rangers at home marked his sole enforced absence, through illness. Ruben Amorim has fretted about Mazraoui’s fitness in recent weeks and his importance could be gauged by his absence from the squad at Brentford.",
      "“Being in a season where you win everything, you come into a kind of flow where you can kick me, I will not feel it,” Mazraoui shrugs. “But when you lose a lot of games, you just give me a little step on my toes and you're in a lot of pain. It's a big difference.",
      "“It's a long season, like I said. It's the end of the season, so of course, physically, after playing so many games, I didn't do that quite often in my career, so of course you're going to feel it a little bit in the body.",
      "“I think the biggest example is Lyon, where we were almost dead in the last ten minutes of the game. Extra time, everybody's tired and everything, and you still manage to win.”",
      "Mazraoui has ping-ponged from right to left this season and his activity during United’s Europa League media day is similar. Mazraoui has to walk the breadth of the Stretford End to fulfil media engagements on Wednesday, inside and outside.",
      "By the time he stops to speak for an interview scheduled for 1pm, it is nearly 3.45pm. That is the sheer demand for one of United’s ever-presents.",
      "As one of the interviewees for the final, Mazraoui is a certainty to start. It is still unclear where yet the spate of centre back injuries suggest he would be a logical inclusion at right centre back.",
      "His relocation there could be permanent next season. “I have some qualities which fit perfectly with the position,” he explains. “Like in the right centre-back, I really like to go forward with the ball. So in the build-up and break the lines, that's something I can do good. So I'm comfortable on the ball.",
      "“But it's not like attacking as wing back. And wing back, a lot of times you come in a right wing position. For that, you really need like Amad one-v-one skill. That's maybe not my biggest strength.",
      "“So on both positions, you know some good points and some points which you feel like, ‘okay, maybe it's better to play in another position’.”",
      "Like everyone, Mazraoui suffered teething issues in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system. Mazraoui was recruited as a specialist right back capable of filling in on the left and, as an Ajax-schooled talent, his instinct is to attack.",
      "Under Amorim, it is markedly different for the defender. “In the beginning, some things were not like going automatically. So instead of going forward, you had to go on the break and stay in your position.",
      "“So some things were different. But eventually, now after a couple of months, this system, everybody knows what to do and how to do it.”",
      "Ten Hag reunited with Mazraoui two years after they both left Ajax in the same summer. Ten Hag gave Mazraoui his debut and the Moroccan played 150 times under the former United manager before he was sacked in October. The pair are still in touch.",
      "In Ten Hag’s penultimate match, he picked Mazraoui as the No.10 in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Fenerbahce. That was a surprise to almost everyone, including Mazraoui. “Yeah, it was a surprise. Not something I didn't do. I did it a really long time ago, before that moment.",
      "“I've always been quite good with Erik. It's not that I talk to him every week. I just texted him maybe one or two times more personally, like, how are you as a person, because it's not only about football.",
      "“You’re never happy with [a manager’s sacking], of course. Getting a manager sacked is always a feeling of disappointment. You feel it as a player as well.",
      "“So yeah, really, I was not happy with that. I was disappointed with that in myself and everybody else was as well, I think. So yeah, that was not the most happy part.”",
      "United have revelled in their Europa League commitments yet a Premier League side await in the final. Mazraoui started in all three defeats to Tottenham, trophyless since 2008.",
      "It is a dicey dynamic for the Premier League’s worst teams bar the sinking ships in the relegation zone. United have the trophy-winning nous and the pedigree yet Spurs are unbeaten in six matches against them.",
      "“Tottenham brings a lot of intensity in their games,” Mazraoui says. “We've seen this already this season. We've played, I think, already three times against them. So yeah, that's, I think, their biggest quality, that they bring so much intensity and pressing in everything, what they do.",
      "“Winning a trophy is never easy. I think in any case you don't downgrade that, because you have to fight hard to get into the position to win a trophy. You have to beat opponents who are strong and who are also really hungry to be in that final.",
      "“Eventually, I think if you look at the end of your career and you look back at your career, you will look back at this season you're going to be proud of winning if we win on Wednesday, of winning the Europa League, more than you're going to look at eventually at the failure in the Premier League. You can be, for sure, proud.”",
      "Are Tottenham’s wins against United relevant? “No, I don't think so. Because this is like a whole different competition. It's Europa League, it's a final, so the context around it is so different that you cannot really compare any games, any previous games with this final.”",
      "Amorim was at a loss to explain United’s Jekyll-and-Hyde form in the Premier League and Europa League. Manuel Ugarte, the last of the summer recruits, opined that the main difference was the physicality.",
      "Mazraoui pinpoints a more glaring issue. “Out of two chances in every Europa League, we score a minimum one. Out of the 20 chances we get in the Premier League, we don't manage to score one. That's the biggest difference.",
      "“So I don't think that has something to do with the league. I don't think that the goalkeepers in the Europa League are that much worse than in the Premier League, so yeah, that's the biggest difference.”",
      "That Dutch bluntness (Mazraoui was born in the Netherlands and retains a Dutch accent) thickens Mazraoui’s skin to withstand Amorim’s candour. He has no issue with some of the Portuguese’s diatribes.",
      "“I like him a lot in that [respect]. He's really honest, really straightforward, he's not hiding from anything,” Mazraoui enthuses. “No (it’s not hard to hear the criticism), for me personally not, because that's how I am as well.",
      "“I'm not hiding behind anything, and that's the manager as well. He takes responsibility, he knows he's the head of the club, eventually, because he's the manager. That's something I like a lot about him because I’m like that as well.”",
      "Mazraoui was involved in three Ajax title-winning sides and lifted the Meisterschale shield that is awarded to the German champions. His winners’ medals are on display at his home, offering daily motivation.",
      "If he gains another one next week, it may be soaked in fizz."

      "Ruben Amorim's brutal honesty about Manchester United's dismal season is turning the Old Trafford dressing room into a more emotional and vulnerable environment, according to defensive stalwart Diogo Dalot.",
      "The Portuguese head coach hasn't sugar-coated United's woes since he arrived. A record of just six wins in 26 Premier League games highlights the depth of the club's domestic struggles.",
      "In January, he branded this the worst United side in history, and after the club's defeat to West Ham a week ago, he didn't hold back in revealing his own concerns and the fear that he could be sacked if he can't turn the club's fortunes around quickly.",
      "That isn't in danger of happening, with Amorim maintaining the support of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has someone who also shoots from the hip and admires Amorim's honest appraisals. But Dalot said seeing the 40-year-old so clearly suffering was hurting the players, while also encouraging them to show how much it is hurting them as individuals.",
      "\"Personally, it hurts a lot, especially not being able to be on the pitch, it hurts even more,\" said Dalot. \"But it is just something he is really honest about.",
      "\"He doesn’t hide his emotions. He doesn’t hide the type of communication he wants to express. And that makes him an honest guy, an honest person.",
      "\"That is really hard nowadays to find, managers and players that don’t go through what you are supposed to say or are supposed to feel. It just becomes natural. And I think being and seeing him like that, it makes you want to be exactly like that. If it hurts you, it is a good sign because you want to change things.\"",
      "Amorim has taken the blame for United's woes this season on his own shoulders, constantly placing his own job in the spotlight and taking responsibility for the run of results.",
      "\"Even if I don’t feel like that, it still hurts to say because he is speaking about my team, my teammates, my club,\" said Dalot. \"I don’t want to hear my manager and anybody around the club feeling like that.",
      "\"So what can I do to change that? That is what I focus on the most. I try to evolve as many team-mates as many people as I can into the same energy and then you have to fight. It is obviously something the club will address, the players have to address also. We have to look at ourselves and see what can I change to be better and try to get in the same pattern everyone should be.\"",
      "Dalot talks warmly about his fellow Portuguese and the attitude and approach he has brought to the job, but he insists he does have the edge and the anger required to succeed in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "\"Don’t get me wrong, he is a nice guy, but when he has to give a stick to everybody, he gives a stick. He isn’t afraid to say what he thinks,\" he said.",
      "\"I think you saw that since he came that he has his own ideas, he will not change for anybody. Because he thinks he is best for the clu,b and I can guarantee you it’s the best for the club. It will take a little bit of time.",
      "\"We see him as he is. When he is happy, he is happy; when he is angry he makes sure everybody knows he is angry. We just have to keep building because I believe together we will do great things.",
      "\"Everybody made a headline when he came about the big storm we needed to go through but that is what we are facing now and we will get through it and people will look back to this time as something was big for the club.\"",
      "Amorim put his hand into his own pocket to fund tickets and travel to Bilbao for family members of his backroom staff, a gesture Dalot said showed how much he cares.",
      "\"It shows how much he wants to keep the club united and keep everybody on the same page and how much he is willing to, in this case literally, pay to be able to everybody be together,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it is an amazing gesture, in my opinion. It could have been easily all the players doing it but just him by himself trying to have that relationship is something incredible.\"",
      "For all of United's domestic struggles, they have impressed in Europe and travel to Bilbao this week, targeting the Europa League trophy and qualification for the Champions League.",
      "They are unbeaten in 14 European matches and have scored 19 goals in six knockout games against Real Sociedad, Lyon, and Athletic Bilbao, but they face domestic opponents in Tottenham in the final.",

      "\"At this stage I have to go day by day to see how I am feeling every day but so far so good,\" he said.",
      "\"It is part of the job. I wouldn’t think in these last two years [when he has played nearly every game] a time like this would arrive. After playing so many game it was a sign probably that the body needed a little bit of a rest but I am working really hard to come back as soon as possible.\""

      "Diogo Dalot was spotted at Carrington on Wednesday, walking back to the first team's temporary quarters after an individual session with physio Jordan Reece. While his teammates were training, a topless Dalot sat down and recuperated in the sunshine just outside the hub.",
      "He then hot-footed it over to Old Trafford to speak in a ramshackle mixed zone. Dalot posed for his Europa League final portrait in one of the stadium's hospitality suites. The hunch is that he will be in Bilbao and his name on the teamsheet, filed among the substitutes.",
      "Luke Shaw was a predictable removal at Chelsea on Friday night. Having gone 14 months without starting for United, he seems assured of starting the Europa League final.",
      "Seeing out the contest in Bilbao could be beyond Shaw. That is where Dalot could come in. Shaw off, Dalot on and Noussair Mazraoui to centre back.",
      "Mazraoui will start against Tottenham Hotspur. Amorim has picked him at centre back and right wing in the past two games, weighing up where exactly to put Mazraoui. United's starting XI at Chelsea could feasibly be the same side that lines up for the unmemorable Europa League anthem.",
      "Amorim is pleased with United's preparations, if not their domestic results. \"Yes, first of all because of the feeling, I didn’t like the feeling of the last game.",
      "\"Then we have five days to prepare for the game, it’s two days to fully recover, we can see video, prepare some things one day to compete. If I put some players out, it was like ten days without a game, I don’t like that.",
      "\"I think the best way to prepare for a final when you have time to fully recover and prepare for the next game is just to compete. And we are Manchester United so we need to compete in every game.\"",
      "The five-day gaps afford United ample recovery time and rhythm. Enzo Maresca was struck by United's man-to-man aggression against Chelsea and they were competitive for at least an hour. Yet United still ended the evening with one attempt on target.",
      "Amorim has agonised over a pragmatic or proactive approach ever since his first training session with the players on November 18. Alejandro Garnacho started in his 14th successive match last week but the return of Amad and prominence of Mason Mount could reduce him to a bench berth.",
      "Tottenham are deprived of two of their most creative talents in James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. There has been chatter that Ange Postecoglou could start a conservative trio of midfielders in Pape Sarr, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, which possibly influenced the redeployment of Bruno Fernandes as a central midfielder at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Casemiro and Fernandes were paired together at Tottenham in February with Manuel Ugarte out injured. That was Casemiro's first start in 48 days and back when his selection was dreaded by United supporters. He has gone from unplayable to undroppable in Europe.",
      "Amorim has spoken before of having Amad \"closer to goal\" and it is probable he will remain as one of the two number 10s. Mazraoui is more comfortable in a back three as it is somewhat similar to right back yet is poised to continue on the right wing, possibly to adjust the balance if Fernandes is in midfield.",
      "That throws up the peculiar pick of the great survivor, Victor Lindelof. Lindelof's United career effectively ends in a week but he is set to be one of three survivors from United's starting XI in the 2021 Europa League final. Shaw and Fernandes are the others.",
      "One could measure the severity of United's decline by the possible presence of Lindelof and Harry Maguire in a 2025 final XI. Those two defenders last signed contracts with United in August and September of 2019. Maguire has earned his extension. Lindelof hasn't.",
      "No wonder eyes are peeled for Yoro and De Ligt on Tuesday."

      "Before this week's Europa League final, Patrick Dorgu will find a quiet time to pray and hope that his middle name delivers to bring him a first senior medal and provides some salvation for Manchester United's season.",
      "Dorgu, a £25million January signing from Lecce, will be playing in his first major final after becoming Ruben Amorim's first signing at Old Trafford. As a left-footed wing-back, he is a key component in the Portuguese’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "The switch to the Premier League from a Serie A side who ended up getting relegated was a big step up for the Dane, but his religion has helped him and it went under the radar in March when he asked United to add his name to the official documentation, making him Patrick Chinazaekpere Dorgu on club and Premier League communications.",
      "Although he was born in Copenhagen, he is proud of his Nigerian heritage. His middle name, which stems from his Igbo heritage from the land of his family, means God answers prayers, and he will be hoping he does just that in Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "“My family are religious and the reason they gave me that name was because of the meaning behind it,\" said Dorgu. “They told me at a young age what it meant. It comes from my Igbo heritage.",
      "“My family’s culture is something I learned about. I believe in God and I am always praying. I hope we win the final - it’s what I am praying for.”",
      "Dorgu might be a quiet presence around the United dressing room as he settles at the club, but he is multilingual. He speaks Danish and English, learnt some Italian during his time at Lecce, and speaks Ebo - a historical name from the Igbo language native to people from south eastern Nigeria - to his family, including his two brothers and two sisters.",
      "His faith might have helped him since making the move to United. Dorgu has had a mixed start to life at Old Trafford, but he knew arriving mid-season at a club having a testing campaign was going to present its own challenges.",
      "“Obviously, I came there in a difficult moment (for the team), so I knew that nothing was going to be made easy for me,\" he said.",
      "“I’m getting better game by game, getting more confident so I hope I can improve even more in the last games of this season and in the seasons to come.",
      "“It is all about working hard, looking forward, believing in the coach and the players and to improve my game. It has been difficult but I think there will be a lot of good years coming up, so we just need to stay focused and win the final.\"",
      "The Europa League final might be a contest between the 16th and 17th best teams in the Premier League, but the stakes couldn't be higher. For one of the two clubs, a dismal domestic season will be glossed over by a European trophy and a seat in the Champions League. For the other, the summer will be dominated by inquests into their worst campaign in more than a generation.",
      "United have the trophy-winning pedigree, having won the FA Cup final in similar circumstances last season, while Spurs haven't lifted silverware in 17 years. But Ange Postecoglou's side have beaten United three times this season, including twice when Amorim was in the dugout.",
      "“Spurs are a dangerous opponent. They have beaten us three times already this season, so we can’t think it will be easy,\" said Dorgu.",
      "“They have beaten us twice in the league and once in the Carabao Cup, so it will be a tough game even though both teams haven’t been playing well. We just hope that we can get the win.",
      "“It would mean a lot to me and to the club and the players. Everyone is, not angry, but disappointed about this season so if we can win the Europa League it will be a boost.”"

      "Three goals in 33 games is bad enough but Rasmus Hojlund's body language, and the unrestrained reactions of his teammates and coaches, are just as disconcerting.",
      "Hojlund was complaining to Mason Mount, a sympathetic sounding board, in the second half at Chelsea. Mount offered an encouraging pat on the head and then exited the pitch. Hojlund was suddenly devoid of an ally.",
      "At full-time, Hojlund turned to his fellow Scandinavian Victor Lindelof and was complaining about something or other. Lindelof soon spotted Jadon Sancho and was one of a handful of United players who acknowledged him.",
      "The press box at Stamford Bridge is directly behind the dugouts, separated by maybe half-a-dozen rows of spectators. Ruben Amorim was particularly piqued with a Dane, though it was Patrick Dorgu. His assistant, Paulo Barreira, was most animated with Hojlund.",
      "Another Portuguese, Bruno Fernandes, berated Hojlund in each half. After Hojlund killed an attack, there was that familiar sigh from the United supporters. It was all-too-familiar fare from a striker who is being bracketed with Garry Birtles, Radamel Falcao and Wout Weghorst.",
      "The punchline is Hojlund is certain to start the Europa League final. That could be his swansong as the starting striker for United. Hojlund was always destined to fail, by association with Kees Vos and the inexplicably exorbitant £72million fee United agreed for him at 3am at Atalanta's training ground.",
      "Amorim seriously tried to suggest he is happy with Hojlund at Stamford Bridge. \"I’m happy. Of course, all the team has to improve, but the way he runs, he fights for every ball, loses a lot of duels, wins some duels, he needs to improve the connection.",
      "\"But he is improving. I’m really happy with him, he just needs to continue working hard and better things will come.\"",
      "In his question to Amorim, a colleague remarked that Hojlund's performance \"left a lot to be desired\". Amorim was never going to dispute that.",
      "Senior figures at United are not having Hojlund. One well-placed source suggested he does not work hard enough. They can cut loose as it is well-established that Hojlund will be replaced in the summer. Amorim, though strikingly frank about United's ills, can't.",
      "The coaching staff have been losing patience with Hojlund for some time. Teammates were hesitant about passing the ball to Hojlund last season and it has been more brazen this season.",
      "Off the pitch, Hojlund is so desperate for approval he is resorting to crass captions, clearly curated by a tone-deaf social media team, on Instagram posts for the banter brigade. All he succeeds in doing is imitating Neal Maupay, one of the worst strikers to ever get a kick in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system is geared to service the striker, so he was never going to entertain the prospect of picking a strikerless team after Joshua Zirkzee was ruled out for the rest of the season last month. Amorim confirmed on Easter Sunday that it would do no good to remove Hojlund from the team. He has stuck to his guns even as Hojlund continues to fire blanks.",
      "There have been two tap-ins since then and a fine performance at Athletic Bilbao, a man light for 55 minutes after Dani Vivian tugged at Hojlund’s shirt. But the Premier League is the truest gauge and Hojlund will be pitted against Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero back in Bilbao. That could be as much of a mismatch as two bouncers turning away an underage schoolboy from a nightclub.",
      "Erik ten Hag dropped Hojlund for United's final three games last season and it was a masterstroke. United won all three, climaxing with their best performance of the post-Ferguson era against City in the FA Cup final.",
      "Hojlund came on in all three wins, scoring against Newcastle United and Brighton before a constructive cameo at Wembley. He left the national stadium that evening swigging from a magnum of champagne.",
      "Gaining the number nine shirt in the summer reaffirmed United's long-term backing for Hojlund. Perhaps things might have been different had he not pulled his hamstring minutes after scoring against Arsenal in the otherworldly So-Fi Stadium in Los Angeles. Hojlund required another scan on the other side of the Atlantic as the first was inconclusive and he was out for eight weeks.",
      "Yet Hojlund has been at United for 22 months now and his first season was creditable. It was not unreasonable to expect or aim for an improvement on his 16 goals last season.",
      "Eleven of his 26 goals have come in the Champions League and Europa League. United have a surfeit of players better suited to European competition (Zirkzee, Dorgu Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to name but four). That is primarily why their supporters have been subjected to the worst United side since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "Tommy Docherty's main recruit that summer was Stuart Pearson. A striker. Hojlund's teammates and coaches seem to be pining for a different striker."

The Brazilian's impressive tally of 15 Premier League goals from 31 appearances during the 2024/2025 campaign is also said to have attracted interest from top-flight rivals Arsenal.",

      "The versatile attacker admitted in March that although he could not leave Vitor Pereira's side in the middle of the season, he “needs to take the step” and challenge for major honours.",
      "“I had a lot of offers but I wouldn’t feel well if I had done it [left Wolves],” he told The Guardian. “Some things you can’t control but I couldn’t leave the club in the middle of the season, in a difficult situation, in the relegation zone.",
      "“Now, we’re close to achieving our goal (of staying up). But I’ve made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things. I have potential.”",
      "United are also targeting Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap, who has a £30m release clause in his contract, which was made active after the Tractor Boys' Premier League relegation was confirmed.

Victory has also secured European football at Selhurst Park for the first time ever, with Oliver Glasner's side qualifying for next season's Europa League.",

      "There is a potential problem on that front, though, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's involvement in Man United and French club Nice could prevent them from being in Europe's top competition. A 6-0 victory against Brest for the latter on the final day of the Ligue 1 season has seen them finish fourth which is a Champions League qualification spot.",
      "UEFA rules had stated that no two clubs under the same control could compete in any European competitions together. Those regulations have since been updated to only apply to the same tournament and thus that would mean United could miss out if they win the Europa League.",

      "Ratcliffe is also exploring a sale of the Ligue 1 outfit and therefore if that is sanctioned, there should be no problems. Even prior to that, he explained why there was never any major concerns that United would be prohibited from playing Champions League football if Nice also qualified.",
      "\"No, there are no circumstances upon which an ownership of Nice would prevent Manchester United from playing in the Champions League. I’ll be crystal clear on that,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"It says you have to change the ownership structure, you know. So it’s all about influence and positions on the board and that sort of thing. A: the rules are changing, and B: there are shades of grey not black and white. Manchester City will probably have the problem before we have the problem because they’ve obviously got Girona.",
      "\"We have spoken to UEFA and I have to say the conversation wasn’t directed at, 'you have to solve this problem and you know we don’t like it'. We have an issue and we might have to change some things. But what they do recognise is that the multi-club model in many circumstances benefits the smaller club quite a lot.",

So that’s a good thing. But what they’re worried about is if there’s ever an accusation that somebody influences the result of a game - lack of integrity. That’s the most concerning thing.",
      "\"We’ve never spent time really understanding the benefits of a multi-club. But we’ve got Omar obviously, who’s been intimately involved in a really successful multi-club, which is Manchester City. So we need to spend a bit of time with Omar trying to understand it a bit better before we finish up with a view.",

Also, the UEFA thing is changing so you have to do it in the light of where you think UEFA is going to finish up, what the handicaps are. There are obviously handicaps involved.\"",
      "Following such a bold admission, it certainly looks as though there will be absolutely zero problems even though Nice's spot in the Champions League has already been confirmed.",

      "\"I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5. That's my game. Maybe I'm a little different than others. But being different is good, right?\"",
      "Former Italian international Thiago Motta had left his post as Bologna head coach around a month before Zirkzee departed, leaving to take over at Juventus. He, too, described Zirkzee's style of play as unique.",
      "\"He said his idols are Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Gabriel Batistuta, who are two excellent players, but, seeing him day-to-day, he reminds me of the Ronaldinho I played with at Barcelona,\" Motta told Sky Sport Italia in February 2024.",
      "\"But I cannot compare him to anyone. He is just Joshua, and he is special.\"",
      "Being compared with Brazilian great Ronaldinho understandably got United supporters excited. Zirkzee was an unknown quantity to most United supporters and their knowledge of him and his playing style was limited.",
      "Ultimately, though, United brought him to Old Trafford to compete with Hojlund, ease the burden on his shoulders and get goals. Forty-eight games into his United career, Zirkzee's goals tally stands at an uninspiring seven, with just three of them being plundered in the Premier League.",
      "As well as scoring against Fulham on the opening night of the campaign, the only other league game in which he has found the net this season was when he netted a brace in the 4-0 win over Everton at the start of December.",
      "It was quickly established that Zirkzee does not have the required skills and qualities to operate as a No.9. He is not a goalscorer and his positioning inside the box has highlighted that throughout the season.",
      "Following United's mid-season switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation under Ruben Amorim, who succeeded Ten Hag in November, Zirkzee has had opportunities to express himself as a playmaker in either of the two No.10 position. To his credit, his performances have been much more accomplished in that area of the pitch, and he deserves credit for that and fighting back from the juncture that saw him booed by some of United's fans when he was substituted in the first half against Newcastle United at Old Trafford in December.",
      "However, there is one burning question that needs answering: does he have a long-term future at Old Trafford? The answer: probably not.",
      "United are now less than a month away from the start of the biggest summer transfer window they have arguably ever faced. The decks need clearing and United need to be ruthless.",
      "Zirkzee signed a five-year-deal at Old Trafford last July and him being moved on as quickly as this summer would send out a clear message that United are in no mood to mess around. They want to strengthen their attacking options and they have established interest in Wolves star Matheus Cunha, who can operate as a No.10, and Liam Delap of Ipswich Town. They have also been credited with interest in Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Zirkzee, who will miss the remainder of the season because of a hamstring injury he sustained against Newcastle at St James' Park last month, is unlikely to be assured of regular game time next season if Delap and Cunha are drafted in at the very least.",
      "United will have to accept a financial loss on the Netherlands international if they are to cash-in, but the same is likely to be said of a few players they plan to offload this summer and ahead of the start of next season.",
      "Zirkzee was linked with an exit from Old Trafford as quickly as January and Amorim, despite outlining his desire for him to stay, refused to rule out the possibility of an exit.",
      "\"I want to keep Josh because he gives everything,\" Amorim said. \"He's trying in training but we don't know, the window is open.",
      "\"We will see what happens. We just need to focus on training and to take this for the next game. So it's just one point. Let's focus on the performance, take this to the next game.\"",
      "Having refused to dismiss an exit there and then, United are unlikely to have seen enough in the last few months to put a hands-off notice on him this summer.",
      "The club needs to generate funds from player sales and several big decisions will have to made to contribute to the squad being revamped.",
      "Ronaldinho comparisons or not, Zirkzee has not done enough in his debut season at Old Trafford to be considered untouchable."

      "Welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, May 17.",
      "United have now played their final game before Wednesday night's Europa League final with Tottenham. Ruben Amorim's men lost 1-0 to Chelsea to continue their Premier League woes.",
      "As has been the case for a while now, the focus isn't on the league with all eyes on next week. United know victory will secure Champions League football at Old Trafford, something that would significantly bolster their pull in the transfer market.",
      "Many names have been linked with a move in recent weeks with Antoine Semenyo, Serhou Guirassy, Leroy Sane and Callum Hudson-Odoi all emerging as possible targets.",
      "Any signings are expected to come as a result of player sales. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are all expected to be sold after spending the current season out on loan. Meanwhile, former boss Jose Mourinho is believed to be sniffing around United looking for a deal.",
      "We will keep you up to date on all this and more in our United blog below...",
      "Manchester United are 'in talks' over a possible move for South American star Franco Mastantuono, according to journalist Graeme Bailey.",
      "The River Plate midfielder has impressed for the Argentinian side this season. Real Madrid and Chelsea are also credited with interest, and it is said the player is keen on a move to Spain.",
      "The journalist told United in Focus:",
      "\"United have spoken to his people this week. However, the thing with Mastantuono is that although he turns 18 in August, I have had it confirmed to me that he won’t be moving until 2026.",
      "\"United are in the running, but the plan wasn’t for him to move this summer anyway. Real Madrid are in the driving seat, but United are not out of the equation.",
      "“I don’t think anyone will pay his €45m (£38m) release clause, though. But he really does want to join Madrid, however, we will have to see because there isn’t really room for him at Madrid.",
      "“But over the last 10 days, United have definitely held talks with him. Arsenal, Chelsea, and Liverpool are also interested.”",
      "Manchester United have been handed a boost for two potential targets in the summer transfer window.",
      "United have been previously mentioned with an interest in Red Bull Leipzig duo Xavi Simons and Benjamin Sesko, with the two players now expected to move on in the summer.",
      "Leipzig played their final Bundesliga game of the season on Saturday. A 3-2 loss against Stuttgart meant they finished the season in seventh place with no European football next season.",
      "That will only increase the speculation over the futures of both Simons and Sesko this summer.",
      "Roy Keane has singled out three players following Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea. Marc Cucurella fired the Blues to victory at Stamford Bridge on Friday evening, extending the Reds' winless streak in the Premier League to eight games.",
      "The 53-year-old was asked whether he would 'fight' to keep the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho at Old Trafford this summer. Keane said: \"I wouldn't be hanging my hat on those three to get Man United [back].",

      "Manchester United have reportedly drawn up two lists of transfer targets, which one they turn to will depend on the outcome of Wednesday's final against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "According to the Mirror, two lists have been drawn up, with one pursued if they play Champions League football next season. The other list is said to be less expansive due to there being no European football.",
      "Both lists are however said to have been designed to 'mould a squad that will be able to deliver a tactical plan' brough forward by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Manchester United defender Ayden Heaven has said it's 'good to be back' following his return from injury. The 18-year-old came on from the bench in Friday night's defeat against Chelsea, despite not training in the build-up to the game.",

      "Real Madrid are moving rapidly to make former Manchester United defender Alvaro Carreras their next signing after completing their move to sign Dean Huijsen.",
      "AS have claimed that the left-back's move to Spain is 90% done. United have a buy-back option worth £15m, a fraction of the £42.1m release clause reports state Madrid will pay.",
      "They also have a significant sell-on clause meaning they will bank a tidy fee from the move.",
      "Writing for Football Insider, former United scout Mick Brown has insisted that the club will not be looking to sell their captain to Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, despite a lucrative offer likely being submitted.",
      "He explained:",
      "Man United will not let Bruno Fernandes go to Saudi. Losing him would be catastrophic, wherever he goes or for whatever reason. It shouldn’t even be a question, there should be no way they even consider letting Fernandes leave regardless of the money involved. The focus is on getting players in around him. They want to strengthen the squad and take the burden away from him, but whatever happens he’s going to be a crucial part of the team.",
      "Ahead of tonight's Premier League clash with Chelsea, Paul Merson has told Amorim that under no circumstances should he be picking Fernandes to start.",
      "He explained in his Sportskeeda column:",

      "Friday night's loss to Chelsea set two bad records for Man United.",
      "The defeat means United will end a first ever Premier League season without winning back-to-back games on any occasion. It also means they have now gone eight games with a Premier League win for the first time in history.",

      "Asked if he 'fight' to keep the trio this summer, he said: \"I wouldn't be hanging my hat on those three to get Man United [back]. \"Mainoo comes on tonight, I watched him closely – he's strolling around, some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho is immature. He plays in little moments, but he doesn't do enough.",
      "\"We spoke before the programme - you want players for the big clubs that turn up week in, week out. He doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent; he makes some good runs and threatens in behind.",
      "\"On his good day, you think, 'I like what I see.' But he's got too many bad days. And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have been a backup striker, third or fourth choice, and learnt his trade off of two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact that when he came to the club he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough! He's obviously lacking in confidence and belief and he's not surrounded by brilliance either.",
      "\"The problems we've spoken about at Manchester United all season are still there. Now if people think they can fix that in one summer then it's not going to happen.\"",
      "Juventus have joined the race to sign Victor Osimhen this summer but reports add that Manchester United and other English clubs have an advantage.",

Ruben Amorim will be keen to add to his striking options in the off-season with uncertainty over the futures of both Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, who have both failed to make a big impact at Old Trafford.",
      "Gyokeres worked under Amorim during the manager’s time at Sporting. He was on the scoresheet again on Saturday as Sporting secured the La Liga Portugal title with a 2-0 win over Vitoria.",

      "Manchester United's full focus on the pitch is now on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Their dismal Premier League season continued on Friday evening as they were beaten 1-0 by Chelsea to ensure they will head into the last weekend of the season in a dire 16th place.",
      "But they can end a dire domestic season with European glory on Wednesday but to do so, the fortunes of forward Rasmus Hojlund will have to change in Bilbao after another difficult night at Stamford Bridge.",
      "One of United's transfer priorities this summer is to sign a new forward and that was only reinforced by another drab night in front of goal for the 22-year-old.",
      "With all that in mind, here is a round-up of the key Manchester United headlines on Saturday, May 17.",
      "Three goals in 33 games is bad enough but Rasmus Hojlund's body language, and the unrestrained reactions of his teammates and coaches, are just as disconcerting.",
      "Hojlund was complaining to Mason Mount, a sympathetic sounding board, in the second half at Chelsea. Mount offered an encouraging pat on the head and then exited the pitch. Hojlund was suddenly devoid of an ally.",
      "At full-time, Hojlund turned to his fellow Scandinavian Victor Lindelof and was complaining about something or other. Lindelof soon spotted Jadon Sancho and was one of a handful of United players who acknowledged him.",
      "The press box at Stamford Bridge is directly behind the dugouts, separated by maybe half-a-dozen rows of spectators. Ruben Amorim was particularly piqued with a Dane, though it was Patrick Dorgu. His assistant, Paulo Barreira, was most animated with Hojlund.",
      "Another Portuguese, Bruno Fernandes, berated Hojlund in each half. After Hojlund killed an attack, there was that familiar sigh from the United supporters. It was all-too-familiar fare from a striker who is being bracketed with Garry Birtles, Radamel Falcao and Wout Weghorst.",
      "This was another game that showed Rasmus Hojlund's limitations as United's No.9. He was easily outfought by Chelsea centre-back Tosin Adarabioyo, who won almost every duel the two of them contested.",
      "Hojlund also didn't do enough sharp work on the ground, and one loose lay-off to Fernandes in the first half summed it up. He should have found the captain with time to play a forward ball to get United moving, but he left a simple pass short and Fernandes had to rush his pass, which was blocked.",
      "The midfielder glared at Hojlund as he retreated into shape and when the ball then went out of play, he rebuked United's No.9. It was another game that passed him by.",
      "He received the ball in a dangerous position during a good spell early in the second half, but was then ponderous in possession and the move broke down. A minute later, Fernandes was under pressure in midfield and had no out-ball. When he was dispossessed, he reacted furiously at Hojlund, who had been stationary rather than giving him an option.",
      "It was a reminder why a striker is right at the top of United's shopping list this summer, with £30million Liam Delap leading the race to lead the line next season.",
      "Read the full story, here.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from a spell out of Manchester United's starting team.",
      "But there are no other senior strikers available in the dressing room, which means Hojlund has been starting by default and lumbering up to deliver lifeless performances at centre-forward.",
      "Another of those performances came against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Friday night. Hojlund offered close to nothing in London, and Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero certainly won't be losing any sleep ahead of their tussle with the out-of-form striker in next week's Europa League final.",
      "United fans have reached their breaking point with Hojlund. They have become tired of watching him each week, although Ruben Amorim seemed to take a more positive view on Friday.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe had an \"extraordinary\" manager in Erik ten Hag, according to Pep Guardiola, but that didn't stop the Manchester United co-owner from giving him his marching orders last year.",
      "Ten Hag oversaw United's famous 2-1 win over rivals Manchester City in the final of the 2024 FA Cup, with goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo cancelling out Jeremy Doku's late strike. Impressed by United's tactical masterclass, which saw them overcome what was thought to be an untouchable City side, Guardiola was quick to sing Ten Hag's praises.",
      "Speaking after the defeat, Guardiola said: \"He's a lovely person and an extraordinary manager. Winning the FA Cup is important for them like last season it was for us.\"",
      "However, the Red Devils' FA Cup win was the sole standout of an otherwise dismal season under Ten Hag's management. United finished a record-low eighth in the Premier League in 2023/24, with just 18 wins from a total of 38 matches, while the side were dumped out of the League Cup by Newcastle in the fourth round.",
      "As for the Champions League, Ten Hag's men failed to make it out of the group stage, finishing rock bottom behind Bayern Munich, Copenhagen, and Galatasaray, after registering just a single victory in six games. Despite questions looming over Ten Hag's future heading into the summer break last year, minority shareholder Ratcliffe and the United board ultimately decided to instil faith in the manager, denying a repeat of Louis van Gaal's sacking just days after he won the FA Cup in 2016.",
      "Ten Hag was awarded a contract extension until July 2026, while he received a sizeable transfer kitty to bolster his squad ahead of 2024/25. Despite spending almost £200million on the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, Leny Yoro, and Noussair Mazraoui, Ten Hag struggled to turn the tide as 2024/25 got underway.",
      "The 55-year-old managed just three wins from the opening nine games of the season before he was let go following a 2-1 loss to West Ham United in October. Despite Guardiola's high praise, Ratcliffe clearly felt that Ten Hag wasn't the man to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford - and he even later admitted it was a mistake to let him keep his job after the FA Cup triumph.",
      "Ruben Amorim was appointed manager of the club the following month, with fans in the northwest expecting big things from the highly decorated former Sporting CP tactician. However, it is argued that the 49-year-old Portuguese mastermind has fared worse than Ten Hag did in his final season.",
      "The club are destined for yet another record-low finish as 2024/25 comes to a close, as well as failing to make it past the fifth round of the FA Cup and the quarter-finals of the League Cup. However, Amorim could still clinch the Europa League title, as the Red Devils are set to face Tottenham Hotspur in the final of the European competition on Wednesday.",
      "Not only would a win remarkably brighten the side's 2024/25 overall, but it would also grant them qualification to the Champions League next season. However, further investment from the board will be needed, with Amorim still struggling to mould his inherited squad from Ten Hag to suit his style of play and United miles off their rivals.",
      "Guardiola, meanwhile, is vying to right the wrongs from last year and win Manchester City an eighth FA Cup on Saturday afternoon, with The Cityzens squaring off against Crystal Palace at Wembley. If successful, it would be the third time that Guardiola has guided the side to the trophy, and it would be his 19th trophy with the side in total, including Premier Leagues, domestic and European titles, Super Cups, and Club World Cups.",
      "On the flip side, a Palace win would mark the first time that the London outfit has tasted glory in the tournament. The Eagles have famously made it to the final of the tournament twice before, missing out to Manchester United in 1990 and 2016, respectively."

      "Wayne Rooney has named the three players Manchester United must sign this summer, including former goalkeeper David de Gea.",
      "Thirteen-time Premier League champions United have a long way to go to reach the same heights Rooney experienced during his 13-year stint at Old Trafford. Under Ruben Amorim, who was appointed head coach in November after Erik ten Hag’s sacking, the Red Devils have suffered their worst season in the league since its formation in 1992.",
      "They are down in 16th place on a record low of 39 points after a horrendous campaign domestically, which has seen them lose 18 league matches. Amorim since his appointment has claimed fewer points per-game (0.92) than Paul Jewell’s infamous Derby County side of 2007/08 (0.94).",
      "And yet, the Red Devils could be playing Champions League football next season if they win their upcoming Europa League final clash against Tottenham. The Old Trafford hierarchy will undoubtedly need to bolster their squad with new additions to avoid embarrassment against the top teams in Europe in 2025/26.",
      "Club legend and all-time United leading goal-scorer Rooney believes three signings can turn around their fortunes next season, naming his former team-mate and goalkeeper De Gea, striker Victor Osimhen and defender Marc Guehi as his preferred picks.",
      "The ex-England striker told Amazon Prime Video Sport: “I’d probably sign David de Gea back. I think Manchester United have missed him and I think he could still do a very good job.",
      "“The second one, I would sign Osimhen. He’s a number nine, I think he’s a really good striker and possibly available.",
      "“And the third one, it would be difficult but I’d sign Guehi from Crystal Palace. As a centre-back, I think he would have a really good impact on the club.”",
      "De Gea spent 12 seasons with United, where he won the Premier League once and United’s Player of the Season award on four occasions. The 34-year-old was released by the Red Devils in July 2023 and waited almost a year to find a new club before signing for Fiorentina at the beginning of this season.",
      "The Spaniard has been outstanding for the Serie A side, helping them secure a European spot while reaching the Europa Conference League semi-finals. He is set to face United in their final pre-season fixture this summer in what will be an emotional game for the veteran.",
      "His successor, Andre Onana, who was brought in for his better ball-playing ability, has caused a number of high-profile errors in-between the sticks since he was signed for £47.2million in 2023. He is widely regarded as a downgrade on De Gea.",
      "Osimhen, meanwhile, is one of European football’s top forward talents, having recently helped Galatasaray to a Turkish Cup victory while on loan from Napoli. MEN Sport understands that United are targeting Ipswich Town's Liam Delap to be their main striker next season but the Red Devils have been linked with the clinical Nigerian in the past.",
      "Rooney’s former team-mate Rio Ferdinand shares his opinion, having recently said: \"Forget Delap’s ability, potential, whatever you want to say about him. His quality as a player, it’s not about that right now for Man United. I think they need experience in there.",
      "\"Someone who knows how to score and someone that these younger guys can learn off. Rasmus Hojlund needs help. He doesn’t need a competitor.\"",
      "Osimhen, 26, scored 26 Serie A goals to end Napoli’s Scudetto long drought in 2022/23, finishing as the season’s top scorer. He has netted 35 in all competitions for Galatasaray this term and is expected to join a new club once his loan spell ends this summer.",
      "His goal contributions are certainly required by Amorim, whose strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have mustered up just seven goals between them in the league this season.",
      "Meanwhile, England star Guehi is considered one of the brightest central defenders in the Premier League. The 24-year-old is being pursued by a host of Premier League clubs, including Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "That, alongside his age, Palace captaincy and standing as a fully-fledged England international, make him an expensive option. However, he would be a worthwhile long-term investment for United, whose injuries this season have left them short of quality options at the back."

      "Interjecting while the former City played shared his memories of that success, Rooney recalled his involvement, or lack thereof, in their route to the final. He was infamously serving a suspension and missed the Manchester derby semi-final, which Manchester United lost to a lone Yaya Toure goal.",
      "\"I think that was the year- did you play United in the semi-final?\" Rooney asked Richards. \"Yes, I was actually injured for that one,\" he replied, \"[Pablo] Zabaleta played, and I got put back in for the final.\"",
      "Rooney then remarked: \"I controversially got suspended for the semi-final.\" Encouraging his fellow pundit to divulge further information, Richards questioned: \"Controversially? \"Do you want to elaborate on that?\"",
      "In response, Rooney asked: \"Well, have you ever heard of a two-game ban?\" He then added: \"It's one or three, no?\" Chapman and Richards concurred, both asking for a reminder of what happened.",
      "\"I scored a hat-trick against West Ham [United] and I swore down the camera,\" he explained. The former now recalled that incident.",
      "The latter quipped: \"I swore down the camera and it got me a gig at the BBC!\" To which, Chapman clarified: \"That was him during the game; that was you post-match after the final.\"",
      "Rooney then claimed: \"Working for the FA at the time was an ex-City guy, and they gave me a two-game ban, and the second game was against Man City in the semi-final.\" Richards, in response, asked, \"Why are you just telling us this now?\"",
      "Chapman added: \"Conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists, eh?\" To which Rooney remarked: \"City cheating again, look.\"",
      "Richards then exclaimed: \"You can't say that!\" Chapman concurred, interjecting to clarify: \"That's what they haven't done as yet, and they deny that, Wayne.\"",
      "Rooney injected to claim it was just \"jokes\" as Chapman continued: \"As we bring you into broadcasting, and I get you off any libel charges. I wasn't expecting that in the first 10 minutes of doing a multimedia show, I'll be honest with you!\""

      "“Since joining the club, he’s shown an ability to adapt, settle into a new environment and progress as a person and a player. Harry had an outstanding first season with the club, and was already enjoying time around the first team in 2023/24 as a result.",
      "“Harry has represented the Under-18s in the league and FA Youth Cup this season, enjoyed UEFA Youth League experience at Old Trafford and in the Netherlands with the Under-19s, and played for the Under-21s in the league and EFL Trophy.",

      "“When you add that to the quality he’s demonstrated since he first joined our pre-Academy, you get a really impressive young footballer. Tyler has captained our youth sides in a variety of competitions across two different age levels, and always represented the club with distinction.",
      "“His performances at Under-21s level saw him become a part of the senior training group, like many of our players this season. We’re very proud of how our players have conducted themselves, but especially pleased when they show enough in training to earn the manager’s trust, as Tyler has done.”"

      "Amorim’s ‘brutal assessment’ of his own shortcomings during his time at Old Trafford has ‘led to concerns that he may walk out at the end of the season’ and Man Utd will ‘seek assurances that the former Sporting Lisbon coach is not contemplating walking out before they make any summer moves in the transfer market’.",

      "It was closely fought title race with runners-up Benfica finishing just two points adrift of Sporting with Gyokeres’ goals making the difference.",
      "The goal on Saturday took the Sweden international’s tally to 39 goals in 31 Portuguese top-flight matches with Gyokeres scoring another 14 in all competitions this term.",
      "And that form has attracted interest from all over Europe with clubs in the Premier League keen to bring him back to England after his spell at Coventry City between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Arsenal and Man Utd seem to be the two clubs most keen on Gyokeres as it stands and the Swede is expected to leave the Portuguese outfit in the summer.",
      "Man Utd have him on their radar with multiple other striker targets, while Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta seems to have decided that Gyokeres will be their top target.",
      "Although the Gunners are yet to make a formal offer for Gyokeres, Arsenal are putting together an offer of around £200k a week to convince the Sporting Lisbon striker to move to the Emirates Stadium in the summer.",
      "And, after controlling a loose ball in the box before dribbling round the goalkeeper and defender to slot in the second goal on Saturday, Gyokeres responded to rumours about his future.",

      "When asked about his future by Sport TV, Gyokeres replied: “It’s football, I’m still here. I don’t know what’s going to happen. Nobody can predict the future.”",
      "Former Huddersfield and Reading defender Naby Sarr insists Gyokeres is “poison” after coming up against him multiple times in the Championship.",
      "Sarr told RMC Sport: “I dealt with two Gyokeres’. The first was already tough and strong, despite a lot of shortcomings.",
      "“It was easy to stop him, his game was very readable. In the end, it was no longer the same story. He became ultra-complete, one of the best players I’ve faced. Speed, power, efficiency, technical accuracy… he worked on all these aspects.”",
      "He added: “What sets him apart from the others is that he’s not lazy. His mindset has always been to tell himself that no ball is unplayable. Even if he seems unexploitable and is five meters behind, he’ll go for it. He’s poison.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the calendar year on an absolutely ridiculous 52 goals. Can he do it again?",

      "Here’s every current Premier League manager ranked by how much they moan – from the zen monks to the ticking time bombs.",
      "",
      "20) Simon Rusk (Southampton)\nTriggered Ruben Dias and for that, not a single bad word will be said about Southampton’s interim manager.",
      "",
      "19) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nHe seems nice, doesn’t he? Glasner gives off the vibe that he doesn’t have a care in the world as long as the powers above just leave him to coach in peace.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle United)\nIt’s rare to see Howe lose his cool. He’s just a chill guy. And for that, we can’t praise him enough. Managing in the Premier League is a chastening experience, yet Howe makes it look like a walk in the park.",
      "That said, he’s not above the odd moan – but more often than not, he takes his medicine and moves on. A true modern-day stoic.",
      "",
      "17) Kieran McKenna (Ipswich Town)\nWe’re not ashamed to admit we’re not entirely sure if McKenna is a moaner or not, which probably means he’s not. Calm, composed and too well-raised to throw shade at referees. We suspect he apologises to fourth officials for blocking their view.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nThree-time Europa League winner Unai Emery is an animated manager, but not overly moany. He’s actually polite and respectful in interviews — and used to be mocked for it.",
      "",
      "15) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nUnited boss Amorim is more prone to self-loathing than anything else. If he moans, it’s about himself or his players being rubbish. It’s a refreshing change from his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, who would rather die than admit fault and still believes Alejandro Garnacho was onside because VAR used the “wrong angle”.",
      "Amorim may yet explode – it’s United, after all – but for now, his grievances are existential.",
      "",
      "14) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nPotter is a man slowly being lured to the dark side by the soul-sapping grind of managing West Ham United. And we can’t blame him. Reporters beware: he might still be polite, but he can swear if you want him to.",
      "",
      "13) Ruud van Nistelrooy (Leicester City)\nThere have been whispers of discontent – complaints about Caleb Okori’s boots, frustrations with players’ living arrangements and public criticism – but overall, Van Nistelrooy has kept a lid on things. He’s moaned, yes, but with humility. Leicester’s chaos hasn’t exactly helped.",
      "",
      "12) Pep Guardiola (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola is in a camp of his own as a very knowing, quite weird and extremely funny manager. He is unintentionally hilarious and we wouldn’t have it any other way.",
      "",
      "11) Thomas Frank (Brentford)\nWhen things don’t go his way, Thomas Frank is well accustomed to throwing his toys out of the pram. Generally, though, he’s pretty reserved and honest, and tends to give compelling answers in both pre- and post-match press conferences.",
      "",
      "10) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nIt’s been plain sailing for Slot in year one, but when the mask did slip – against Everton – it was spectacular. Even in defeat to PSG, he was almost serene. But four yellow cards suggest something’s simmering under the surface. Next season, we’ll see the real him.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nThere’s no hard evidence – but Pereira feels like a moaner. This season has gone well for him, which helps. But if Wolves had VAR go against them in a key game, you just know he’d throw the fourth official’s board into the stands.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nMaresca recently complained about the St James’ Park atmosphere influencing the referee, as if Nicolas Jackson hadn’t just elbowed Sven Botman in the head. Pick your battles, Enzo.",
      "His comments may have been more about the decisions that followed, and Maresca comes across more as a disciplinarian and standard-setter than a simple moaner.",
      "",
      "7) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nGet this man going, and it’s hard to stop him. Forest’s incredible season means Nuno hasn’t had much to complain about, but we all know he has it in him.",
      "",
      "6) David Moyes (Everton)\nMoyes might be more reserved and calm now he’s back at Everton, but there’s no doubt he still loves a good moan. It’s not always reporters who get the brunt of his frustration — sometimes it’s poor German ball boys. Nobody is safe when he’s in the mood.",
      "",
      "5) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nThe youngest boss in the league found himself in Arsenal’s crosshairs after claiming Declan Rice’s red card early in the season was fair and saying Joao Pedro booting the ball away was irrelevant. Arsenal fans noticed – and pounced.",
      "Hurzeler’s comments ensured the Gunners sleuths were ready to swarm at the first hint of hypocrisy. And they did just that. Their obsessive nature has kept the German’s moaning firmly in the social media spotlight — helping to propel him up this ranking.",
      "",
      "4) Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham Hotspur)\nBig Ange is ranked high, mainly because he despises Spurs fans and hates having to be Spurs manager. That results in a lot of moans, groans and passive-aggressive monologues in press conferences. His inconsistencies are part of the charm, though – ‘everyone’s human, mate’ becomes ‘the whole system is broken’ within a week.",
      "He’ll be gone soon. We’ll miss him.",
      "",
      "3) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nNo Premier League manager has received more yellow cards this season than Andoni Iraola, with his most recent caution coming on February 1 against Liverpool. He’s learning. Slowly.",
      "The Basque boss wears his heart on his sleeve and isn’t shy about speaking his mind — even when Bournemouth win.",
      "",
      "2) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nWe are now into the category of top-tier moaners. In second place is Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta — who many would have top, and we wouldn’t blame them.",
      "Clearly a tremendous manager and, by most accounts, a nice guy, Arteta has still managed to rub a lot of people up the wrong way. He’s widely disliked for his animated touchline behaviour, which often crosses the line — both literally and figuratively.",
      "The Spaniard’s infamous ‘desgracia’ rant after losing to Newcastle in November 2023 will go down as one of the greatest post-match headlosses in Premier League history.",
      "Say what you like about him, but the Premier League would be a duller place without Arteta.",
      "",
      "1) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nHere he is. The moaniest manager in the land.",
      "He’s been fined, racked up yellow cards, and delivered more fury than any manager outside the top six. And because he’s Fulham manager, it mostly goes under the radar. Not anymore.",
      "Oh, and Silva has a tell when he’s agitated: he fixes that beautiful hair of his. And he does that a lot.",

      "Man Utd require a major squad overhaul as their squad is far from good enough and unsuited to Ruben Amorim‘s preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "United’s transfer business has been awful in recent years as they remain miles away from winning the Premier League despite sitting second in our net spend table.",

      "Man Utd paid around £36.5m to sign Joshua Zirkzee from Serie A outfit Bologna last summer and the Netherlands international has endured a rollercoaster debut season at Old Trafford.",
      "After scoring in his Premier League debut, Zirkzee was dreadful for a few months and was deemed an “invisible” player, but his form in recent months has improved as he comfortably outshone Rasmus Hojlund before suffering a season-ending injury.",
      "With Man Utd set to sign a new striker this summer, Zirkzee or Hojlund could move on to rebuild their reputation elsewhere.",

      "“They need to find an agreement on the payment terms. Man Utd are working on it. Man Utd have very good connection with Cunha, with his agents.",
      "“It’s a very positive conversation. Ruben Amorim appreciates Cunha, and Cunha knows that very well.",

      "Now, former PGMOL chief Keith Hackett has ‘demanded’ the offisde rule to be changed, as the current regulations are “detrimental to the game”.",
      "“It is frankly detrimental to the game to have goals ruled out for a toe being offside. This decision to rule out the goal is in line with the current law,” Hackett told Football Insider.",
      "“My view is that the law on offside needs to change and move towards the interpretation that is suggested by FIFA technical director Arsene Wenger and [give the] benefit of the doubt with [the need for] daylight between attacker and defender.”",
      "Hackett also commented on three more flashpoints during Chelsea’s win vs Man Utd, insisting the officials were right to deny penalties after Tyrique George and Amad Diallo dived inside the penalty area.",

      "On Chelsea’s appeals for a penalty for a supposed handball by Rasmus Hojlund, he said: “The ball was struck hard in the direction of Hojlund who had no chance of getting his hand out of the way given such a short distance involved. Correct decision by the officials.”",
      "Despite another loss, Man Utd boss Amorim attempted to take positives from the Chelsea match.",
      "“I think we started great, well but in the final third we needed to be a bit more aggressive,” Amorim said.",

      "“It was different but you never like when you lose the game. We were competitive, that was clear.”",

      "Man Utd lose to ‘Kavanagh FC’\nIn the money laundering cycle, I believe Chris Kavanagh tonight was what you’d call the washing part of the cycle. United 14 “fouls” and 6 yellows. Chelsea only 10 fouls (should have been plenty more) and 1 yellow for time wasting. Nothing for simulation, he did give Amad one despite a contact (never a penalty I’ll agree). But it’s not like the home fans are intimidating they only know how to sing their own name. He was given his orders. There were some positives for United to take in the first half but didn’t deserve to lose to Kavanagh FC.\nAnthony",

I’m also going to a 4 2 3 1 formation because it works for me on Football Manager and therefore is right.",
      "GK: I’m going to give Onana the nod, mainly due to bias, but if I was being a prick and not admitting to my bias, I’d probably make some vague claims about his form for Ajax and Inter and a loose point about United’s defence being an absolute shower of clowns",
      "RB: Mazraoui gets in because he has been an excellent addition, the sort of which we don’t make nearly enough of these days. A fully fit and in form James would obviously start, but as with Shaw at LB, this simply hasn’t been the case often enough",
      "CB: I haven’t watched much of Chalobeh so will just assume that F365 are right in saying he has been strong since coming in to the side",
      "CB: If I could stick VAR here I would as it seems to be the best hope of not conceding (certainly for United), but since we haven’t fully moved to AI yet, I’ll stick with Tosin",

      "DM: I’m honestly quite pleased for Caicedo, purchased for crazy money and hounded for that, but has been strong for most of this season",
      "CM: Bruno, can do everything. Also very likely the captain",
      "AM: Palmer has had a difficult second half of the season, but is a certain starter in my team (also a Manc which gives him bonus points)",
      "RW: Amad has really come on this season when given a chance, and I am firmly of the opinion that in a half decent side he would be even better",

If I misread that then apologies.",

Parades are also excellent for the city and businesses within it, the fact earthworm Jim doesn’t want to have one further exemplifies what a sh*t businessman he is that he doesn’t recognise it’s good for PR. Good for brand. Good for his business and local business and also brings some Levity to what has been a rough season for the Manchester tarts.",
      "That shouldnt be even the slightest bit controversial. You can both celebrate a trophy while also addressing the failings in the league.",
      "Second hot topic since United are in the final is whether it’s fair or not for a team finishing outside European qualifications to then get it for winning a trophy. Would Wenger et al also argue Palace shouldn’t get in Europe if they win the FA Cup? Or how about Seville when they won it and finished 12th that year? Or do these silly rules only apply to clubs we don’t like?",

It also makes those trophies more prestigious again and provides the winners with a financial bonanza because the £2m that the FA cup currently rewards isn’t even a months gate receipts for a top 10 club. It would also mean that more actual champions are in the champions league.",
      "If you think finishing 4th should be better rewarded than winning a trophy I think you miss the point of football. This season 5th place will get in..5TH! some of the other leagues in Europe don’t even get in if they win their league and we have 5th place getting in?",

      "Few reminisce 5 years down the line over that run to 4th if you don’t win the Champions League next year (only Liverpool have ever done that, maybe Chelsea too, no time to look) or if it is something you have done before and are reasonably expected to do. Winning a trophy is an amazing memory no matter how small – the day out, the one-off emotions of it all, the party afterwards, that’s what football is all about. That doesn’t always warrant an open bus top parade that shuts down a city though, and really it shouldn’t. Funnily enough, the hardest places to get permission are Manchester and London, go figure.",
      "Also all teams and councils aren’t the same, it comes down to relativity. United basically won trophies every single year, you have to apply to the council to have a parade and that comes with implications. So in their pomp, United only have parades for major trophies (Prem and Champs), since then, they’ve maintained that. It doesn’t mean there aren’t major fan celebrations in other forms, just not a parade that shuts down a city, requires policing, logistics with local authorities, road closures, permissions from businesses that require access, safety concerns, ambulances assigned, etc. Hopefully you get the point.",
      "Newcastle never win sh*t, Leeds and other teams likewise, so shutting down the city once every 25-100 years for a parade makes sense. In Manchester, there would be parades every single year with varying levels of interest/disinterest – look at City’s ‘turn-out’ for a treble lol.",
      "West Ham had a parade for the Intertoto cup, Portsmouth had a parade and were roundly mocked for reaching the FA cup final, Cardiff for finishing 2nd…. mocked, mocked, mocked. I’m sure United headlines would be full of capitalised EMBARRASSMENT and SHAME if they had a parade.",
      "I must repeat and emphasize without sounding rude, I’m guessing your fandom is online only – Many celebrations happen in the city for trophy wins, just not an open-top parade that shuts the city down…. no one is miserable after a win. Hope that clears things up.",

      "Late offsides…\nA few thoughts on the ‘late offsides’ debate. I find this gets an unwarranted amount of airtime so I’ll give it some more",
      "It seems like the numerous proponents of this argument have been desperate for an injury in the few seconds of ‘meaningless play’ preceding a late flag that occur in most games to prove their point. It has now finally happened after a mere 5 years and nearly 2000 games of Premier League football demonstrating the likelihood of injury in this phase of play is extremely low.",
      "During this time there have been multiple other serious injuries some of which could have no doubt been avoided through more consistent refereeing of dangerous tackles and violent conduct or a reduction in the fixture burden. These seem like much more pressing issues.",
      "It would be very difficult to introduce a rule whereby the flag is raised for obvious offsides. In the Villa PSG game, Shearer was moaning about the flag going up late when Dembele went through, but went silent when the replays showed he was actually on. Even in the game in question, the offside looked more obviously than it was because elanga was almost at full pace and the defender was stepping up. If the ball was released a couple of milli-seconds earlier it would have been on.",
      "It would also create an imbalance whereby VAR is able to correct situations when the flag should have gone up but not when the flag went up but shouldn’t have for the most obvious errors, leading to less goals.",
      "Finally, the whole concept of a ‘meaningless period’ of play is a bit philosophical and hindsight driven. Most of the play in football is meaningless when you know what happens next. Towards the end of the season some entire games are meaningless and indeed some clubs have been meaningless throughout their entire history (Spurs). Why do people get so worked up by the max 5-10 seconds per game from late offside flags?\nWill AFC",
      "",
      "Time for a change…\nHere’s a wild idea for a Thursday afternoon that will grow the English game to new heights – Champions League playoffs. Hear me out.",
      "As someone who has never been comfortable with the idea of the Champions League containing teams who finished second, let alone fifth – these are not “Champions” people – I’ve always thought at least one of the additional spaced should be given to our domestic cup winners. That really would bring back the magic of the FA Cup and/or give the League Cup some relevance it’s never really had. Everyone always objects to this for perfectly good reasons, though often this boils down to “my team always finished in the top four so why should I vote for that?”. Arsenal fans basically.",
      "However, with every additional spot, the Premier League gets for the Champions League, the whole thing is becoming more and more that European Super League that we all said we definitely didn’t want (big fan of the new format though). Even with United and Spurs threatening not to compete in any sort of European football next season, they’ve both blundered their way to a final chance to win Big Cup next year. We need to do something about this nonsense.",
      "And then we have the everlasting spectre of playing meaningful games abroad. We don’t want it but the money men certainly do. Give them the Community Shield I used to say.",
      "Until now.",
      "What i propose, is that in the seasons where England gets a fifth Champions League spot, an end of season tournament is held to decide who gets it. Four teams vying for the same thing Arsenal win nearly every year without any actual hardware to show for it. In fact let’s lay a trophy on the line as well. (To be designed by the mailbox, naturally).",
      "To qualify, you must win the FA Cup, the League Cup or finish 5th or 6th. If the FA Cup or League Cup winners are in the top four then it’s extended to 7th. If both are in the top four then 8th gets a go too.",
      "As an example, if City win the FA Cup, this year’s playoffs would currently include Chelsea, Aston Villa, Forest and Brentford, Brentford beating Forest 4-0 in the final. Tell me that doesn’t sound like fun? This would give us 5 champions – Liverpool, Newcastle (league cup), City (FA Cup), Brentford (5th Place trophy) and Spurs (Europa League – United becoming #1 banter club in the process) – and Arsenal (trophyless but definitely “THE BEST TEAM” qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "This also gives Palace more incentive to beat City in the Cup Final (cos they need more apparently) and replace Brentford in the Fifth place trophy playoffs. Imagine the live feed to Brian Mbeumo’s living room (he’s got the whole team round to watch obviously) as Palace score two last minute goals to get a come from behind win against City. Gutted. You’ve also got Fulham in 11th with a chance of grabbing that final spot off Brentford in the next two weeks. It’s magic.",
      "And finally, we can do all this abroad to shut everyone up about the 39th game. It’s basically meaningless but also potentially transformative for a side that wins it so might just hit the sweet spot and be acceptable to English Fans.",
      "It’s amazing. I’m surprised no one’s thought of it already!",
      "I mean it’s definitely more interesting than what happens now though I suppose it provides another backdoor into the Champions League for underperforming clubs. It also adds games to an overcrowded football schedule. And it’s bad for the planet.",
      "I guess what I really want is for UEFA to limit Champions League entry to League winners, reinstate the Cup Winners Cup and let everyone else fight it out in the Europa League. But somehow my other idea seems more likely. It’s probably not an original idea but if it is I want 10% of the revenue generated by it.\nAshmundo (UPTFR)",

      "Goodbye Goodison…\nSad to see another of the great grounds depart. Between Highbury, WHL, Upton Park, The Dell and Maine Road…and Roker Park, the Baseball Ground…these stadia all had something so unique, and despite Spurs seemingly having done what many of the others failed, in retaining a sense of the old ground – just on steroids – the fans of all those teams I have spoken to, all miss the old ground, and would happily return to their old homes.",
      "The reasons for moving are all sound, but there will always be something hollow in the new stadium.",
      "Misty eyed nostalgia? Sure. I mean, I don’t miss being crammed into a toilet splashing around in piss, or the jostling queue for a warm plastic bottle of Carslberg, but the echoes of glory (and failure) can’t be recaptured.",

An unbeaten WSL campaign, multiple records shattered, and now a shot at completing a domestic treble in this weekend’s FA Cup Final.",
      "From what I’ve seen when attending matches, there’s a strong presence of male fans in the stands—but what really stands out is the number of families. The atmosphere is less hostile than the men’s games, making it a more welcoming and enjoyable experience for people of all ages. The ticket prices are also far more accessible, which certainly helps when bringing the whole family along.",
      "Personally, I’ve seen the women’s game grow dramatically in both audience and quality in recent years. If you haven’t yet, I really encourage all football fans to watch their women’s team, support them, and if possible, attend a match in person.\nThe Admin @ At The Bridge Pod"

      "Two games both featuring one side desperate to win in order to qualify for the Champions League and another that couldn’t give a damn in a bid to achieve the very same feat is an historically bizarre state of affairs. The 7.30 and 8.15 kick-offs on a Friday night only added to the unsettling feeling.",
      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou took very different approaches with their starting lineups in preparation for the Europa League final next week. Amorim came good on his promise of picking a strong Manchester United XI against Chelsea in a bid to avoid them being caught cold in Bilbao, while injury fears prompted Postecoglou to play the Tottenham backups vs Aston Villa.",
      "This perceived injustice led to great gnashing of teeth from Blues fans, who had seen their side romp to a 3-1 win over a hungover Liverpool less than two weeks ago, up against a midfield trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott. Swings and roundabouts.",
      "It wasn’t a walk at Villa Park anyway. Son Heung-min looked like something closer to his old self on a happy hunting ground that’s seen him score more Premier League goals as a visitor than any other player (6), swinging a curled effort just over the bar, while Wilson Odobert’s flick after an excellent counter-attacking move was well saved by Emiliano Martinez in a first half which saw the home fans grow increasingly nervy and quiet.",
      "Villa were the dominant team. Antonin Kinsky was forced into a wonderful save to deny Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins was found in excellent positions on two or three occasions, while the outstanding Marco Asensio was frequently seen drifting past challenges in the No.10 position and saw one whipped effort drift agonisingly wide of the post.",
      "It was pretty clear after 13 minutes at Stamford Bridge that things weren’t going to plan. This Manchester United team had been in the ascendency to such a degree that Chelsea had lost all sense of themselves, leading Robert Sanchez to wave the players forward from a free-kick deep in the Blues half before booting it in the general direction of the helpless Tyrique George. There’s nothing Enzo Maresca hates more.",
      "When Harry Maguire volleyed in Bruno Fernandes’ cross, before they were handed a VAR reprieve for the most marginal of offsides, the Chelsea players resembled England vs Iceland at Euro 2016: anxious; confused; shellshocked. And they were playing the football to match.",
      "We lost count of the number of missed passes, while simply controlling the ball appeared to require extraordinary levels of concentration. Aside from an early fluff from Noni Madueke, which would probably have been ruled out for offside had he scored in any case, and a stunning effort from Reece James from outside the box which clipped the post, Chelsea offered very little against a side proven to wilt under the slightest pressure.",

The impact of George playing out of position as the No.9 paled in comparison to the suspended Nicolas Jackson, who’s a long way from perfect and an absolute fool for getting sent off against Newcastle, but is a handful for defenders even at his worst.",
      "Chelsea relied upon the only player to provide a moment of quality in the first half to come up trumps in the second. It was brilliant from James, who unsurprisingly impressed throughout at right-back because he’s a brilliant right-back and not a central midfielder, no matter how much Enzo Maresca tries to convince us he is.",
      "Space opened up for the captain on the edge of the box for a shot, but instead of taking it on with his left, he pirouetted onto his right and as everyone expected him to let fly he clipped the ball delightfully to the back post for Marc Cucurella, who extended his lead as Chelsea’s top scorer in 2025 with his fifth goal this year.",
      "Helped by an understandably meek Manchester United, whose focus had well and truly turned to Wednesday as Amorim rang the changes after going behind, Chelsea saw the game out comfortably, with some very welcome passion displayed by the players, manager and fans that was absent for 70 minutes here and all too often in a run that had seen them slip from the Champions League places.",

      "When asked at a pre-match press conference if signing Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder Wirtz would be the perfect start to summer recruitment, Guardiola said on Friday: “This is not the time to talk about that. Before the final of the FA Cup, I have 24 exceptional players. I am not going to talk one second about the future.”",
      "Guardiola was also previewing their FA Cup final clash against Crystal Palace with the game representing Man City’s final chance of silverware in the domestic season.",
      "When asked if he learns more from a final loss or a final win after winning and losing the FA Cup final in the past two seasons, Guardiola added: “First of all I want to thank the fans for wanting to come and support us. Winning is much better than losing. But you learn from the losing, last season was special because three or four days before we won the Premier League for the fourth time in a row so maybe our mindset was not perfect.",
      "“The team didn’t have bad play, some decisions went against us. We lost it, in finals it happens. It was important we were there and again one year later we are there again.”",
      "On Crystal Palace, Guardiola continued: “They are a threat because they have quality. [Jean-Philippe] Mateta is strong and the quality in [Eberechi] Eze is obvious and of course the pace from [Ismaila] Sarr.",
      "“Sarr against Aston Villa in the semi-finals they punished them a lot, incredible pace. But not just him, Munoz, [Adam] Wharton is really good holding midfielder who links well inside. They are well structured defensively and their set pieces is one of the best in the Premier League. It’s a final. If we play against Palace or Aston Villa it would be the same. It’s a final, we cannot expect anything different.”"

      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",

      "READ: ‘Arrogant’ Arsenal star, five Man Utd flops, only one Spurs man in ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of 2024/25",
      "But now reports in Spain claim that his continuation at Real Betis beyond this season has been ‘seriously complicated’ and the ‘main obstacle is qualifying for the Champions League’.",
      "It now looks almost certain that Real Betis will finish outside the top five in La Liga and that ‘directly affects the club’s financial aspirations, which would be unable to afford either a loan with advantageous terms or a permanent signing of the player.’",
      "Man Utd have told Antony that he is ‘not in their plans for next season’ with the Red Devils ‘looking for a way out for him, preferably through another loan, in the hope that he will maintain his form and increase his market value’.",
      "And now Villarreal, who look likely to pip Betis to fifth place and a Champions League spot, ‘enters the scene’ and the prospect of moving to El Submarino Amarillo ‘has enticed Antony’s entourage, who are keen to remain in Spain, but with a team with greater international exposure’.",
      "The Brazilian would ‘would fit perfectly into the manager’s plans’ at Villarreal with the Spanish club having the ‘upper hand’ over rivals Real Betis.",
      "It is understood that ‘what is clear’ is that Antony ‘will leave Manchester United again, and his destiny will be determined by the most ambitious project he faces.’",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "According to reports, one ‘beleaguered’ Manchester United star ‘faces’ being offloaded this summer, while three potential replacements have been mooted.",

      "Manchester City and Chelsea somehow escape unscathed, while Liverpool – predictably – have no representatives in the ‘Big Eight’ Premier League Worst XI of the season; Manchester United have five.",
      "To keep things fair, this team only includes players who’ve made at least 20 appearances and 10 starts in the Premier League this season. Match ratings come via WhoScored, so don’t blame us — blame the algorithm.",
      "",
      "GK: Andre Onana (Manchester United) – 6.52\nEvery goalkeeper has a clanger in them – it comes with the territory when you’re playing in the most high-risk position on the pitch. But this is a particularly erratic bunch. Robert Sanchez, Guglielmo Vicario and Onana have all been walking VAR checks at times, while Emiliano Martinez, Ederson and Nick Pope aren’t exactly bastions of reliability either. Even David Raya and Alisson have had wobbles, though they’re clearly less error-prone than the rest.",
      "The algorithm has Onana rock bottom of the lot, and it’s hard to argue. Four errors leading to a shot and three leading directly to goals in the Premier League – plus a bizarre knack for making himself look smaller in his goal – make him a prime candidate to be replaced. If United had a bigger budget, Ruben Amorim would surely axe him.",
      "",
      "RB: Archie Gray (Spurs) – 6.17\nWe do feel for young Archie Gray. He’s filled in at right-back, centre-back and left-back in an injury-ravaged Spurs side, with the occasional reward of a cameo in midfield – his actual position.",
      "It’s been a turbulent season for Ange Postecoglou and his squad, and the algorithm has picked out Gray as the scapegoat, somehow making him the only Spurs player in the ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of the season.",
      "Clocking up 1,563 Premier League minutes is no small feat, but playing here, there and everywhere, rarely in his natural role, probably isn’t doing wonders for his development.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.33\nAnother teenager enduring a bruising introduction to Premier League life. Leny Yoro’s debut season has been littered with injury setbacks, and limping off against West Ham on Sunday now puts his Europa League final place in doubt.",
      "That would be a fitting end to a stop-start campaign. United were warned about his fitness record before splashing £52million on him from Lille last summer. A metatarsal injury in just his second appearance ruled him out for months, and he didn’t make his Premier League debut until December 4.",
      "There’s clearly loads of potential – no-one’s disputing that – and it’s been a brutal year for just about everyone at Old Trafford. But this has been far from the ideal start for the 19-year-old in particular.",
      "",
      "CB: Pau Torres (Aston Villa) – 6.41\nA bit of experience at the back, but not quite the calming influence Aston Villa hoped for. Pau Torres looked a smart signing after arriving from Villarreal in July 2023, settling quickly into Unai Emery’s system. But things have unravelled somewhat in 2024/25.",
      "Villa’s January-February wobble – one win in seven with Torres injured – seemed to underline his importance. But since returning to fitness, he’s played in just four of their last eight games, all wins, and isn’t looking quite as undroppable as he once did.",
      "With calls for Tyrone Mings to get the nod over him, Torres suddenly feels more like a rotation option than a defensive cornerstone.",

But two red cards have dragged down his average rating enough to sneak him into this back four.",

      "It’s been a miserable season all round, but United could still salvage something by beating Eriksen’s former club, Spurs, in next Wednesday’s Europa League final. He’s unlikely to start that one, which means he’ll probably get run-outs against Chelsea and Aston Villa in the final two league games – in a last-gasp attempt to bump his average rating and escape this team. Because obviously, that’s what he really cares about.",

Villa have coped well without him, and with Marcus Rashford likely to leave, Donyell Malen looks set to leapfrog Bailey in Unai Emery’s pecking order – alongside Jacob Ramsey and Morgan Rogers.",

      "The big question remains: where is his best position? It could be attacking midfield, up front, or maybe he’s destined for a Joelinton-style reinvention as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Rather than seeing this as a problem, Amorim might do well to view Zirkzee’s versatility as a genuine opportunity.",

      "In 30 Premier League appearances this season, he’s managed a miserable four goals. Whatever excuses you want to make for United’s struggles or his age, that return is nowhere near good enough for a striker who cost so much.",

      "",
      "GK: Robert Sanchez (Chelsea) – 6.58\nDebates like Sanchez vs Andre Onana are exactly why we copped out with the WhoScored rating process. Both are error-prone but capable of world-class acrobatics. Unfortunately, the errors feel more frequent these days.",
      "What Onana does have over Sanchez is continuity: he’s United’s undisputed No.1, thanks in no small part to Altay Bayindir being extremely dodgy. Sanchez has rotated with Filip Jorgensen but has been Chelsea’s first choice for most of the league season. He should start on Friday, but a Europa Conference League final starting berth is up for grabs.",
      "",
      "RB: Noussair Mazraoui (Manchester United) – 6.79\nA rare bit of solid recruitment from United, Mazraoui has been quietly reliable since arriving from Bayern Munich for a measly £15m. He’s featured at right-back, left-back and as a wide centre-back in Ruben Amorim’s three-man defence, as well as in attacking midfielder under Erik ten Hag.",
      "He looked more comfortable in a back four for Ten Hag but has still been one of Amorim’s most consistent players. He gets in ahead of Reece James, who’s mostly been used off the bench as Enzo Maresca carefully manages his fitness.",
      "",
      "CB: Tosin Adarabioyo (Chelsea) – 6.67\nAnnoyingly, Tosin’s rating is 0.02 better than Trevoh Chalobah’s, who has formed a solid and settled partnership with Levi Colwill in the latter half of the season. If this was opinion-based, Chalobah would be in.",
      "Still, Tosin – signed on a free from Fulham – has started 13 league games and been a regular in the cups, including 10 of Chelsea’s 12 Conference League fixtures. A shrewd bit of business.",
      "",
      "CB: Levi Colwill (Chelsea) – 6.70\nThe highest-rated options were actually Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez, but the former has only played two league games and the latter’s been out since February with an ACL injury.",
      "Colwill, meanwhile, has been a mainstay for Chelsea, starting 33 of their 36 league matches.",
      "",
      "LB: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United) – 6.84\nDalot has been hit-and-miss under Amorim but the algorithm hasn’t minded too much. He just edges out Marc Cucurella (6.63). Often shuffled around, he’s spent some time at left-back and just about gets the nod here.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Chelsea) – 7.02\nCaicedo has recently been filling in at right-back while Romeo Lavia partners Enzo Fernandez in midfield, but we’re picking players in their natural positions for this XI.",
      "The Ecuadorian has quietly been Chelsea’s most consistent performer this season, and the £105m price tag has stopped being a stick to beat him with — which is always a good sign. He also scored a belter at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture.",
      "",
      "CM: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – 7.20\nUnited’s best player by an absurd distance. Fernandes has been excellent despite the circus around him. Without him, United might have exited Europe months earlier and ended up scrapping with the bottom three.",
      "",
      "RW: Amad Diallo (Manchester United) – 7.17\nFully fit and finding form at the right time. A shame Ten Hag didn’t trust him — might still have a job if he had.",

      "AM: Cole Palmer (Chelsea) – 7.35\nThe chippy chips connoisseur ended a ludicrous 18-game goal drought recently, but still has 15 goals and eight assists in 35 league appearances, which tells you how ridiculous his first half of the season was.",
      "He bagged a hat-trick against United at Stamford Bridge last season and will hope to torment them again as Chelsea chase a top-five finish.",
      "",
      "LW: Pedro Neto (Chelsea) – 6.78\nPlenty of wide options, all underwhelming.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s ineligible and wouldn’t start anyway, Mykhaylo Mudryk is still suspended after that failed drugs test, and Alejandro Garnacho is wildly inconsistent. Neto might not be setting the world alight, but he’s probably the best of an unconvincing bunch.",
      "",
      "ST: Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) – 6.41\nNicolas Jackson would’ve made this XI, but he decided to smash Sven Botman’s jaw and is suspended. So it’s Nkunku by default.",
      "He only has three Premier League goals but remains Chelsea’s second-top scorer across all competitions with 14. A summer move is likely — Liverpool are reportedly sniffing.",

      "What’s the point?\nIn the mailbox, Moses mentioned United don’t have parades for anything but Premier league and Champions league triumphs. What is the point of this self-imposed misery? The europa league is hardly a minor achievement if they do win, why not have a parade? Because you’re above that?",
      "If you can’t enjoy the journey to the top of football there really is no point. If the prem/champions league is the minimum why even have parades then? You should be winning trebles etc.. Treating football like a business where you can only celebrate hitting these benchmarks is just sad. Supporting a football club is not something you must do, why volunteer yourself for this and then treat victories like they’re actually not a good thing.",
      "Maybe I’d understand if it’s below expectations, like if City won the europa league, but United have now been utterly wank (by their lofty standards) for half of the current millenium. I hate United but still think their fans should enjoy a win, also hate Leeds but the parade they had for promotion looked great. I recently was at a Panachaiki (Patras) game where they managed to secure survival in the Greek second tier, hardly the zenith of football but all the locals who’ve watched their team continuously worsen over the past 20 years were having a great time (They’ve since been relegated for financial reasons but oh well). I’ve seen others point out they would be mocked for having a parade, who cares? Maybe this has only really risen with social media, but I cannot think of anything more insecure than not celebrating in case Ty from AFTV calls you a loser.",
      "Also agree totally with Lee (LFC) about Ratcliffe’s self made nonsense and what he forgot to include is when these massive corporations buyout struggling companies, they typically take out big loans, the debt from which is then saddled onto the struggling company they now own so said struggling company also has to pay off the loan used to buy them, as well as a variety of fees from their new owners (Which they avoid tax on!).

The utter joy in Sunderland was a sight to behold. Of course for Coventry fans — or Stockport for that matter, it’s agony, but the point I wanna make is that the playoffs are pure sporting drama — agony and ecstasy.",
      "There’s a lot of talk about how boring the PL season has been — with some truth, to be fair – and it made me wonder whether they’ve considered a playoff for the final CL spot (s)? so Top 4 get into the CL and then 5-8 play off? It would certainly liven things up. One of the joys of the playoffs is that a team can be way off it and still nip in to the final place.Stockport were 10 points better off than us (and it showed, quite often) and yet we’re the ones going to wembley.

      "And now, here we are with Taiwo Awoniyi (who I wish a speedy recovery, and I’m sure everyone else does as well).  I sit by a fellow season ticket holder in the Holte End who loses his shit every match when the assistant referee puts the flag up for offside about 2 minutes too late and I remind him every time that “it’s not his/her fault, they’re just doing what they’ve been told to do”.",
      "No amount of evidence or argument will convince me that this rule is a good one – it’s absolutely pointless and basically says VAR has the final say.  If that’s the case, we might as well do away with assistant referees altogether because the only other thing they have to do is flag for fouls or direct which way a throw in is given, with most of those decisions resulting in said assistant referee either not giving it at all or looking blankly at the actual referee waiting for them to give it! (Obviously not a serious suggestion.)",
      "The fix for this is really very, very simple.  If the player is blatantly offside by a considerable visual distance then let the assistant referee put their flag up as they will 99.99% be correct (if they’re not, demote them).  If the player is “close” to being offside to the point where it’s not visually easy to spot, THEN delay the raising of the flag so that VAR can check and confirm afterwards.  Yes, players may still get injured this way but it will be a hell of a lot less than the decisions where they are miles ahead of the last defender.  This makes perfect sense to me and I’d be interested to hear what other readers/commenters think?\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (And whilst we’re at it, keep VAR checks to 30 seconds otherwise the ref’s original call stands as it’s not “clear and obvious”.  You could even pipe the Countdown music out in the stadiums whilst the check is taking place.)",

      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""

      "Chelsea held their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification as Marc Cucurella’s second-half header secured a 1-0 win over Manchester United to send them fourth.",
      "The pressure was on for Chelsea after Aston Villa beat Tottenham, a result which would have moved them above Enzo Maresca's side had they dropped points but, after a tense wait for the breakthrough, captain Reece James set up Cucurella with a fine turn and cross.",
      "Although Ruben Amorim went with a strong line-up ahead of the Europa League final, if Chelsea had slipped up against this United side, 16th and now winless for a record eight Premier League games, questions would have been asked.",
      "Chelsea will at least be in the top five when they go to Nottingham Forest in their final game of the league season on May 25. Victory at the City Ground would guarantee a return to the Champions League after two years away.",
      "United have now lost 18 games in the league this season and are yet to hit 40 points, usually the target for teams to avoid relegation, with just one game left against Villa. Everything is riding on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Chelsea: Sanchez (7), James (8), Tosin (7), Colwill (8), Cucurella (8), Caicedo (8), Enzo (7), Palmer (7), Madueke (6), George (6), Neto (6).\n\n\nUsed subs:  Gusto (6), Lavia (6).\n\n\nMan Utd Onana (6), Lindelof (6), Maguire (6), Shaw (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (5), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (5), Amad (6), Mount (6), Hojlund (5).\n\n\nUsed subs: Garnacho (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (6), Heaven (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Moises Caicedo.",
      "There was a party atmosphere after the full-time whistle blew for the final time at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea's owners are just one win away from their first Champions League qualification after more than £1bn spent and three coaches sacked.",
      "Behdad Eghbali, co-founder of Clearlake Capital, and co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley were on the pitch enjoying the moment with players and staff after the win was sealed. How different it might have been if there was another slip.",
      "Chelsea did not find it as easy as others had against United and, without suspended striker Nicolas Jackson, it was not clear where the breakthrough would come from as Tyrique George, 19, struggled up front in his first league start.",
      "Tension had built around the stadium - and only grew when Villa's victory over Spurs was confirmed - until the skipper came up with the moment of brilliance required to break the deadlock, having struck a post with an exquisite strike in the first half.",
      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",

      "\"I feel confident, it's the most I've played in a few seasons. I want to help the team and hope we can finish it in the right way.",
      "\"The Champions League is where the club belongs, competing in the best competitions. People like to write us off and call us young ,but it's an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do to get the three points.\""

      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",

      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",
      "It is too close to call with two games to go in the hunt for the top five...",
      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",
      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",
      "Opta's supercomputer has given them a 38 per cent chance of breaking into the Champions League spots.",
      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",
      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",
      "\"I don't see Newcastle beating Arsenal away and then they have to beat Everton, a difficult team to play against.",
      "\"Forest need to get a result and win at West Ham or they will finish seventh. It is massively exciting. You wouldn't want to be in it!\""
