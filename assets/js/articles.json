      "Manchester United face a huge week in their season, with games against Chelsea and Liverpool up next for Erik ten Hag's side, though an injury crisis has ripped through the squad",
      "Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans are available for Manchester United's Premier League trip to Chelsea tomorrow.",
      "Varane came off at half-time of United's 1-1 draw at Brentford last Saturday, while Evans – who was not in the matchday squad – has recovered from a calf injury. With Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof both ruled out for a month, the return of Varane and Evans is a huge boost for boss Erik ten Hag and United's late push for a Champions League spot.",
      "Asked if he had any more injury issues, Ten Hag said: “No more issues, we don't need them. On the frontline and midfield we are okay and we have options there. But in the backline we have a lack of options. The good thing is back in training this afternoon is Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans. Yesterday Harry Maguire was also back in training.”",
      "Asked why his squad had been beset by injuries throughout the season with Altay Bayindir, Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia and Anthony Martial also out, Ten Hag was tight-lipped and said: “We have an idea but we will work on it. Internally, we will deal with it.",
      "“You can't prevent injuries, and it's not only us who've had this. The standards in the Premier League, from an intensity perspective, are so high, the overload of the schedule and international football is so huge. We have [many] internationals in our squad. City, Liverpool and Newcastle have all had injury problems, many other teams as well.",
      "“In this moment, it's especially in the defensive department, but in the midfield and frontline the players are available. We don't train, because we recover, then you go to the next game.”",
      "United must win all of their remaining nine games to have any chance of snatching a Champions League spot, after the disappointing draw at Brentford, which saw United concede an equaliser in the 99 th minute, after scoring two minutes earlier.",
      "The poor display at Brentford came after United's epic 4-3 comeback win over Liverpool in the FA Cup at Old Trafford, with Ten Hag saying: “I'm long enough in football to know and some of you should also understand why such things happen.",
      "\"Sometimes you are not playing well but we are Manchester United, you have to win and you cannot give it away like we did - that was the biggest disappointment for me. We keep going.”",
      "Asked how he handles the players after such a below-par performance, Ten Hag said: “It depends on the situation you are in as a team, also how the players see it, how they express it on the pitch, then you take a strategy, how to handle this.”",
      "Ten Hag was asked if he was surprised Chelsea were down in 12 th spot, despte the huge outlay on their squad, Ten Hag said: “It's a tough competition, it's very tight and it's also a lot about which players are available and which are not.",
      "“When you're on the right side of the line, you can have a successful season, but when on the wrong side you can have a much more difficult season. For the rest, they have a fantastic team, fantastic players and play very good football. They can beat anyone and have shown in this league.”",

      "Manchester United are making enemies with other clubs due to their ruthless recruitment drive, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils, whose football operations are now led by minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, have been aggressive in their pursuit of individuals in recent months. They've already landed Omar Berrada, who will come in as CEO in the summer, from rivals Manchester City as they bolster their quality off the pitch.",
      "Since then Ratcliffe has targeted Newcastle chief Dan Ashworth and Southampton's Jason Wilcox. Both men have looked to force through moves to Old Trafford with Ashworth now placed on gardening leave and Wilcox said to have resigned from his role at St Mary's.",
      "As a result The Sun has reported that club chiefs up and down the country have discussed the nature of United's aggressive recruitment. Many are unhappy about their behaviour with Ratcliffe, so far, being halted in his moves.",
      "Ashworth moved to St James' Park after impressing at Brighton and Hove Albion. He's not long been in his role with Newcastle but has expressed a desire to leave and move to Manchester. The Magpies have demanded a huge compensation fee, which United are currently refusing to pay.",
      "Newcastle are prepared to stand their ground which could leave Ashworth having to see out his contract before he can move to Old Trafford. Wilcox meanwhile was director of football at promotion chasing Southampton, but the Saints have been angered by the nature of United's approach.",
      "United had offered a year of Wilcox's salary to the Championship club as compensation. Sources at Southampton claim the Red Devils were only given permission to speak to Wilcox on the condition that their offer would be far more generous.",
      "Wilcox has a 12-month notice period and Southampton are more than willing to dig their heels in to get the necessary cash. Wilcox previously worked at the Etihad under Berrada and United want him to play a role in their set-up moving forward.",
      "The future of Erik ten Hag remains unclear beyond this season. The Dutchman has failed to kick on from a promising debut campaign with the Manchester outfit facing the prospect of no Champions League football next term. They could yet win a trophy, but a list of managerial replacements are being drawn up.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Kieran McKenna is performing miracles at Ipswich and has got them on track to earn a second successive promotion back to the Premier League",
      "Kieran McKenna is a dark horse to become the next Liverpool boss.",
      "That is according to Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony, who believes McKenna is destined to manage a so-called 'Big Six' side after guiding Ipswich to the top of the Championship. McKenna spent over three years as a first-team coach at Manchester United before joining the Tractor Boys in December 2021.",
      "He kept Ipswich in League One before guiding them to promotion last season. The Suffolk club are riding a crest of a wave right now and have a serious chance of returning to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years. During his time at Portman Road, McKenna has won 73 of his 125 matches so far.",
      "And now, MacAnthony has backed McKenna to become a Premier League boss in the future, pointing out the vacancy available at Liverpool when Jurgen Klopp leaves in the summer. The Reds are considering their options to replace the German and could look at the work McKenna is doing at Ipswich.",
      "Asked if McKenna is destined to manage in the top flight, MacAntony told talkSPORT: \"Yeah, I was being laughed out of the studio by [producer] Luke – a Liverpool fan - this morning, as an outside dark horse (to succeed Klopp).",
      "\"I love his brand of football. I've been watching him since last year in League One and what he's done. You can say that Ipswich are a big club, but they didn't go out and spend mega-millions in the summer.",
      "\"They kept a large part of the squad and the team from League One and they're top of the Championship with five or six games to go, it's incredible really. It's not just his coaching and managing, it's his style as well. It's great to watch. If you watched that game yesterday, it was a great advert for the industry. It was just non-stop. Russell [Martin] does a great job with Southampton and his style.",
      "\"Then you've got Ipswich with their style and it was just an enthralling game to watch and that's what you want to see. I think he's destined for the top. I think he wins promotion with Ipswich this year and he'll surprise people with what he'll do with them in the Premier League and within five or six years, he'll be managing a top-six club.",
      "\"That's with due respect to Ipswich. I respect everything they've done there, but I don't think you can keep a guy like that down forever.\"",
      "Liverpool are still searching for their new manager after Klopp confirmed back in January he will be stepping down at the end of the season. Xabi Alonso was the red-hot favourite to succeed Klopp but has ruled out a departure and will stay at Bayer Leverkusen for at least one more season.",
      "Meanwhile, it has been reported that Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi is not on their shortlist and they are looking at alternative targets. Ruben Amorim and Julian Nagelsmann are among the new leading candidates to replace Klopp as the Reds embark on a new adventure, eight years since Brendan Rodgers was sacked.",

      "Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson has tipped Chelsea to beat Manchester United and believes Erik ten Hag will be under \"massive pressure\" if he loses his next two games.",
      "United produced a dismal performance at Brentford on Saturday and were fortunate to come away with a point. After being dominated throughout, Mason Mount thought he had won it for the Red Devils in the 96th minute, only for Kristoffer Ajer to score moments after to salvage a deserved draw.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea failed to beat 10-man Burnley at Stamford Bridge in their first game after the international break. Dara O'Shea netted a late equaliser for the Clarets, shortly after Cole Palmer had put the Blues back in front for his second of the afternoon, with Josh Cullen scoring the other goal.",
      "Despite Chelsea sitting six places and eight points behind sixth-placed United, Merson has backed the Blues to return to winning ways and reignite their European hopes.",
      "Merson told Sportskeeda: \"Manchester United are a million miles away from the likes of Liverpool at the moment. Liverpool have kids playing at times, and United are still so far behind them.",
      "\"Their performance against Brentford was very worrying, and they're going to have to make a decision at the end of the season. Are they going to give Ten Hag another chance? I'm not sure.",
      "\"It's very difficult to predict this game. It's not even a big game, is it? This used to be a mouthwatering fixture. Now, one of these teams got ripped to shreds by Brentford, and the other wasn't able to dominate a ten-man Burnley side.",
      "\"This is a manager's game, if I'm being honest. Neither team would want to lose this football match. If Ten Hag loses this game and suffers another defeat against Liverpool next week, he'll be under massive pressure.",
      "\"Chelsea have the home advantage, but they're not really dominant. It'll be a big worry if they don't beat Man United, because Chelsea fans will remember what Brentford did to United. This won't be an easy encounter, but Chelsea should be able to win this game. I'm going for 2-1.\"",
      "United have endured a difficult campaign which has seen the pressure rise for Ten Hag. The Red Devils have lost 11 of their 29 Premier League matches and finished rock bottom of their Champions League group. Although United are into the FA Cup semi final, it has not papered over the cracks.",
      "As for Chelsea, they have struggled despite spending over £1billion on transfers since Todd Boehly took over from Roman Abramovich in May 2022. The Blues have impressed in domestic cup competitions but their Premier League form has flattered to deceive, winning just 11 of 28 so far.",

      "The former United defender selected the Reds' star as the player he would take from Jurgen Klopp to most improve Erik ten Hag's side. Neville suggested that the Dutch international would improve the players around him, something he does not think Varane is capable of in United's backline.",
      "The 30-year-old arrived at Old Trafford in 2021 in a deal worth £42million from Real Madrid. The Frenchman won four Champions League trophies and three La Liga titles in 10 years with Los Blancos but has endured a more tumultuous time with the Red Devils.",
      "Varane has made 92 appearances for Man United but has seen injuries interrupt his progress with the club. Regardless, Neville had plenty of praise for the World Cup winner but simply does not reckon his talents include managing his teammates.",
      "\"I would take Van Dijk,\" said the Overlap pundit. \"I don’t think he’ll [Varane] ever be that player.",
      "\"For me, when I watch Varane, he actually defends his part of the pitch very well and the box very well – he heads out a lot of balls and is quite dominant in the air. I just think he’s that kind of centre half who will always do – and to be fair he might have been at Real Madrid when he was alongside [Sergio] Ramos – his own job really well but I don’t think he’ll impact the players around him.",
      "\"And that’s not a criticism by the way, because to be fair there are many great centre halves who do their own job very well but don’t actually manage a back four. A great centre half who can manage a back four is your Van Dijks, your [John] Terrys – great players of all time – but he’s just one of those great centre halves that does his own job really well, I think.\"",
      "Neville went on to explain the presence that Van Dijk would bring would supersede any impact that Mo Salah could offer. The ex-England international suggested that the gap was closer between United's forwards and the Egyptian, while Van Dijk would transform the culture at Manchester United.",
      "He said: \"I just think that Van Dijk would bring dominance to the team and a presence in the team that we haven’t got. We haven’t got a forward as good as Mo Salah, but we’ve got talented forwards.",
      "\"I always think if you’ve got a spine of strength and presence… We always say, don’t we, 'Oh, there’s no Roy Keanes anymore, there’s no Vincent Kompanys anymore, there’s no John Terrys’ – there actually is one now at Liverpool, when you think about how he’s performed this season, Van Dijk. He’s a massive presence on that pitch.",
      "\"He’s not the same character as some of those that I’ve mentioned, but he actually is quite dominant on the pitch, he speaks a lot more than people might think and he actually is someone you can see that’s got an aura about him.",
      "\"And I think that if you want to change Manchester United ’s complete and utter culture, then they need that dominant person who holds them together. And I think Van Dijk would control [Kobbie] Mainoo, even someone like Antony or [Marcus] Rashford. I think he would build them, not break them.\"",

      "Spanish giants Real Madrid have succeeded in luring some of South America's top talents to the Bernabeu and remain hopeful of repeating the trick despite Manchester United interest",
      "Teenage River Plate star Franco Mastantuono is the latest wonderkid on the radar of Real Madrid, with the Spaniards looking to steal a march on clubs from England, Spain and France.",
      "Mastantuono, 16, scored his first senior goal in February in a 3-0 Copa Argentina win against Excursionistas. The playmaker has also featured nine times in the league this season, with River sitting three points off top spot after 12 rounds of fixtures.",
      "Manchester United are said to be among the clubs to have scouted the teenager, with Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain also linked. United already have one talented Argentinean youngster in their ranks, with Alejandro Garnacho joining from Atletico Madrid's academy at 16.",
      "Real Madrid have an impressive recent track record of their own when it comes to young talents. Palmeiras forward Endrick is due to sign from Palmeiras when he turns 18 in July, and Mastantuono could follow.",
      "According to Marca (via Football Espana), Madrid look set to step up their efforts to beat those three other clubs to the wonderkid. Los Blancos have recruited from River Plate in the past, most notably with the signing of Gonzalo Higuain, while former Real Madrid manager Santi Solari began his playing career with the Buenos Aires club.",
      "Back in February, TyC Sports (via The Star) named Mastantuono as one of four players United were eyeing after missing out on Julian Alvarez. World Cup winner Alvarez, another River Plate academy graduate, joined Manchester City in the summer of 2022 and won the Treble in his first season.",
      "The other three names mentioned at the time are Aaron Anselmino, Ian Subiabre and Tomas Parmo. Central defender Anselmino plays for River's fierce rivals Boca Juniors, while winger Subiabre is a team-mate of Mastantuono at El Monumental and attacking midfielder Parmo is at Independiente.",
      "Mastantuono signed a new deal with River Plate in March, with a release clause reported at around £38.5m. The new deal could allow River to recoup a significant fee for another young talent after selling Claudio Echeverri to Manchester City for a little under £22m earlier this season.",
      "The playmaker might not be the only Manchester United target to move to Real Madrid. Marca also reports the Spanish side have an eye on Leny Yoro, the Lille centre-back who has been linked with an Old Trafford switch.",
      "Yoro, 18, has been a regular in Ligue 1 for Lille this season. The teenager, who is represented by Jorge Mendes' Gestifute agency, is out of contract in the summer of 2025 and Les Dogues are expected to brace themselves for summer bids.",

So he’s the best striker in the world and he helped us to win what we won last season and the reason why we don’t create many chances is not because of Erling.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is cutting costs at Manchester United in a bid to ensure the club complies with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United were fined £257,000 by UEFA last summer after breaching their financial fair play (FFP) rules and Ratcliffe has now initiated a cost review process, with ESPN reporting that the corporate credit cards of senior figures at the club have been cancelled as part of the process.",
      "Over the past two summer transfer windows, United have spent £381million on new signings and their earnings have also suffered following their elimination from the Champions League in the group stages earlier this season.",
      "The report states that United have hired Interpath to 'review all costs and expenditure at the club' as a result, even though the club remain confident they will not breach PSR. As a result of the review, heads of department are said to have had their corporate cards scrapped in a bid to 'change the culture and become more cost-focused'.",
      "\"We have seen this season that Financial Fair Play rules have real teeth, so we have to be very careful to ensure we remain compliant, and we will,\" United's chief operating officer Collette Roche warned back in December.",
      "\"That means being really disciplined on spending going forward, with a balance between incomings and outgoings.\" Ratcliffe has also spoken about the financial challenges facing United, admitting there is \"no question\" their summer spending will be limited.",

      "\"So that does impact FFP going forward, because they've used quite a large part of their allowance... It's obviously related to sales as well as purchases, and so we need to get our heads around that well before the summer window, so we understand the number but there's no question that history will impact this summer window.\"",

      "Andre Onana has opened up about the advice he received from legendary Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar when he first joined the club.",
      "Onana made the move to Old Trafford last summer, with the Red Devils forking out £47.2million to sign him from Inter Milan. The 28-year-old had previously worked with manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax, with Van der Sar also the club's CEO during that time.",
      "And Onana has now revealed Van der Sar, who won four Premier League titles at United, gave him some important advice when he signed for the Red Devils. \"I had the privilege to have him [Van der Sar] at Ajax and he advised me a lot,\" Onana told the official club magazine Inside United.",
      "\"We had a great time there. We achieved a lot of things together. Obviously, I had the honour to train a few times with him when he was coming to the training sessions. It was nice.",
      "\"He had a great career here and he's done a lot of things for Manchester United and for me. I'm still in contact with him and very happy to talk to him sometimes, when we can. Talking about him is something great because he did a lot for me.",
      "\"I spoke to him when I signed here and even, I think, a few months ago. He told me: 'Andre, what can I tell you already? You are already used to the pressure. Just give yourself time and show the world who you are. I already know who you are'.\"",
      "Van der Sar served as Ajax's CEO between 2016 and 2023 and suffered a brain haemorrhage last July while on holiday in Croatia. He has since recovered and visited Old Trafford to watch United's 3-2 win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day.",
      "Onana, meanwhile, has been ever present for United this season with 40 appearances across all competitions. However, he endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford after making some costly errors.",

      "\"When I moved from Amsterdam to Milan, that adaptation was quite easy. But it took me seven, eight months here. It was just time to learn and go game by game. Everything was new, it was difficult for me to feel at home, for so many reasons, in a new country.\"",

      "Manchester United's transfer business since June 2022 has had Erik ten Hag's fingerprints all over it, but the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe is expected to change things",
      "Erik ten Hag is expected to have much less of a say on Manchester United's transfer business - even if he keeps his job as manager.",
      "Since his arrival from Ajax in June 2022, Ten Hag has had a significant influence on the Red Devils' recruitment; particularly signing players who he's either worked with previously or has seen play in the Dutch Eredivisie. After a promising first campaign, the United boss has been slammed for his transfer record and has been given no assurances over his future ahead of the all-important run-in.",
      "Ten Hag's influence is now set to be weakened by changes made to the club's football department by recently arrived co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS colleagues. A new CEO in Omar Berrada has already been appointed, while United remain in talks with Newcastle over compensation for technical director Dan Ashworth, who's been put on gardening leave.",
      "On Monday, it emerged that the Red Devils had made a formal approach to snap up Southampton director of football Jason Wilcox, who's renowned for both spotting and developing talent. With those new figureheads in place, the Mail report that Ten Hag would subsequently not have as big of a say when it comes to transfers.",
      "Working alongside current football director John Murtough, another member of the hierarchy whose role is likely to be affected by Ratcliffe and co's changes, Ten Hag has signed 16 players across four transfer windows. The majority of those have played in the Netherlands, while Antony, Lisandro Martinez, Andre Onana and Sofyan Amrabat were all coached by Ten Hag at their former clubs.",
      "Despite Ratcliffe's refusal to publicly back Ten Hag, the Dutch boss insists that he and INEOS' visions are aligned. In January, Ten Hag defended his record on transfers, arguing: \"I know everything is highlighted more at the moment, because the performances aren't there. But don't forget, last season everyone was saying how the signings for Manchester United were very good because, as a team, we performed.",
      "\"Everyone was saying how great Martinez was doing, everyone was telling me [Christian] Eriksen was a top signing. Tyrell Malacia? Very smart. Then we had Antony, who was doing okay. Casemiro? Brilliant, everyone was saying last season. So we must judge them in the moment.",
      "\"I think all the signings are top players. What we have to do now is find a way to perform as a team and then we will judge them very differently. We have to understand and acknowledge we have to do it together. We have to be on the same page, in the same boat.",
      "Your turn! Should Manchester United sack Erik ten Hag? Let us know your stance in the comments section.",
      "\"We have to perform together, because all of those players are very good signings. But playing for United is so different to playing for any other club. It's so much more difficult to play and perform for United, than at another club. So you need a very strong character to perform, to deal with the high expectations.",
      "\"And, of course, when the price is high, the expectations will rise even more. But - and I have said this previously - this is the best club you can want to play for. This is the best challenge you want and I would go for that challenge if I was a player and had a choice to make.\"",

      "To understand why Manchester United want Jason Wilcox as their new technical director, you only have to look at a recent interview from Sir Jim Ratcliffe on his transfer philosophy.",
      "Ratcliffe was asked, against the backdrop of United's exorbitant spending on big-name stars over the past decade, about his plan to overhaul the club's poor recruitment strategy of the past decade. United have spent more than £1billion on signings since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, but failed to mount any kind of challenge for the Premier League title in that time.",
      "New United co-owner Ratcliffe's answer was telling and explains why he and his INEOS team have identified Southampton director of football Wilcox as the man they want to improve recruitment.",
      "\"I'd rather find the next Kylian Mbappe than spend a fortune trying to buy success,\" said Ratcliffe. \"It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way? Anyone could figure that one out. Much more challenging is to find the next Mbappe or Jude Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.\"",
      "Asked if he would like to sign Bellingham, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not where our focus is, the solution isn't spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They've done that over the last 10 years.",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes who are managing and organising the club and make sure we get recruitment right. It's such a vital part of running a football club today, finding new players.\"",
      "The move for Wilcox is the latest from United in a bold and unashamed approach to recruit the best in class in a radical overhaul of the football structure at Old Trafford, to remedy the mistakes of the past decade.",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, the former Great Britain cycling supremo, is in charge of the new-look football operation at United, with the first major coup the poaching of Omar Berrada from neighbours Manchester City, to become the club's new chief executive.",
      "United have also made a move for Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth, who is currently on gardening leave, pending an agreement on a compensation figure that would allow him to take up his new role at Old Trafford.",
      "Wilcox, born nine days apart from Ashworth, is a former Premier League winner with Blackburn who earned three England caps. In the two decades since his playing career ended, he has forged a reputation as one of the most accomplished developers of young talent in the modern game, hence why United have come calling for him.",
      "Wilcox's role at United will be to report to sporting director Ashworth, his remit to identify and nurture the best young talent, a role he excelled in at Manchester City where, as academy director, he oversaw the emergence of Phil Foden and Cole Palmer from the youth ranks through to the first-team.",
      "Ratcliffe and his team know that is the route they need to take if they are to make United successful again.",
      "As academy coach and then Under-18s head coach, Wilcox won the Under-18s Premier League title and took City to two FA Youth Cup finals, underlining his prowess in bringing the best out of young players. Moreover, City have won the last four Under-18s titles, further proof of Wilcox's impact at the club, before joining Southampton last summer, after serving a period of notice.",
      "It is that expertise that Ratcliffe and the new football operations team at United want to tap into, which is why they have pursued Wilcox so aggressively.",
      "And why, despite Southampton's insistence they will not just roll over and let him leave, the 53-year-old is certain to end up at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United have been well behind Liverpool for much of the past decade, but Jamie Carragher still believes that Jurgen Klopp's squad would be boosted by one of the Red Devils",
      "Jamie Carragher has picked out Kobbie Mainoo as the one Manchester United player he would like to have in Liverpool's team.",
      "Mainoo has starred in what has been his breakthrough season at United, making 21 appearances in all competitions so far. He has also earned a call-up to the England senior squad, making his full debut in the draw with Belgium last week.",
      "Despite being just 18 years old, he is now seen as a key player by boss Erik ten Hag. His performances have also seen him draw admiring glances from supporters of rival clubs, including Carragher.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's clash between United and Liverpool, the Reds legend was asked which player he would like to take from Ten Hag's squad. While he briefly considered naming Marcus Rashford, Carragher ultimately landed on Mainoo.",
      "\"I think I'd probably take the young kid Mainoo. His age, number one, I think he looks like a superstar and he could go on to be a real superstar,\" Carragher told The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "\"I'm trying to think who else in the Unied team is better playing in their position. Maybe Rashford because Liverpool in the summer, obviously under a new manager, but would that be a position you look at?",
      "\"Wide left because I think Diaz is good, I don't think he's great. So that could be a position. But I think with Mainoo in central midfield. Yeah, I would go with him just for the age factor.\"",
      "Ten Hag has also already revealed himself to be a huge fan of the young midfielder. He hailed Mainoo's performance against Belgium for the Three Lions, insisting it reflected well on United.",
      "“I thought it was very good, but we are not surprised. We have seen what he is capable of, that he can very quickly adapt to high levels. It looks very natural. We are very happy for him and of course a little bit proud,\" he said ahead of the draw at Brentford.",
      "\"I would say very proud. It’s great for the academy of Manchester United that they bring up a player so young going into the national team. That is a big compliment for the whole club. I think definitely in the first place for himself because he did it.",
      "“But also for all the ones who worked with him during his time in the academy, so it’s very good news for Manchester United. If he crosses the line, yeah, of course I as a manager, we as coaches, will interfere.",
      "“But so far it’s not necessary because he enjoys football, he wants to win, he wants to give his best every day because he want to improve. As I say, he just wants to have fun on the pitch. For him, it’s fun to play dominant, to dictate the game and to win the game.”",

      "Gary Neville overlooked Mohamed Salah as part of an honest answer when asked which current Liverpool player he would most like to sign for struggling Manchester United",
      "Manchester United need to sign a commanding centre-back like Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk to go to the next level, according to Gary Neville.",
      "United are sixth in the Premier League, 11 points adrift of the top four following their dismal 1-1 draw against Brentford on Saturday. Erik ten Hag is under huge pressure for his job, with new owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe considering his options, with England boss Gareth Southgate top of the list and Wolves ’ Gary O’Neil being eyed as a coach.",
      "Ten Hag’s side have scored just 40 goals in their 29 matches this season – a pitiful tally which puts them 15th in the Premier League in terms of goals scored, above only Crystal Palace, Everton, Sheffield United, Burnley and Nottingham Forest. By contrast, their defence has shipped 40 goals – the fourth best total, behind only the top three of Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Nevertheless, Neville thinks their problems begin at the back and, given the choice, would rather steal Van Dijk from Liverpool, instead of Mohamed Salah. Speaking on The Overlap, he said: “I would take Van Dijk.”",
      "Asked why he’d go for the centre-back over Salah, Neville explained: “I just think that Van Dijk would bring dominance to the team and a presence in the team that we haven’t got. We haven’t got a forward as good as Mo Salah, but we’ve got talented forwards.",
      "“I always think if you’ve got a spine of strength and presence… We always say, don’t we, ‘Oh, there’s no Roy Keanes anymore, there’s no Vincent Kompanys anymore, there’s no John Terrys’ – there actually is one now at Liverpool, when you think about how he’s performed this season, Van Dijk. He’s a massive presence on that pitch.",
      "“He’s not the same character as some of those that I’ve mentioned, but he actually is quite dominant on the pitch, he speaks a lot more than people might think and he actually is someone you can see that’s got an aura about him. And I think that if you want to change Manchester United’s complete and utter culture, then they need that dominant person who holds them together. And I think Van Dijk would control [Kobbie] Mainoo, even someone like Antony or [Marcus] Rashford. I think he would build them, not break them.”",
      "United hoped they had signed a player of Van Dijk’s quality when they landed Raphael Varane from Real Madrid in the summer of 2021 for £41million. But the Frenchman has not lived up to his billing, struggling to find consistency and missing 39 games through illness or injury.",
      "“I don’t think he’ll ever be that player,” Neville said. “For me, when I watch Varane, he actually defends his part of the pitch very well and the box very well – he heads out a lot of balls and is quite dominant in the air. I just think he’s that kind of centre-half who will always do – and to be fair he might have been at Real Madrid when he was alongside [Sergio] Ramos – his own job really well but I don’t think he’ll impact the players around him.",
      "“And that’s not a criticism by the way, because to be fair there are many great centre-halves who do their own job very well but don’t actually manage a back four. A great centre-half who can manage a back four is your Van Dijks, your Terrys – great players of all time – but he’s just one of those great centre-halves that does his own job really well, I think.”",

      "Ratcliffe took part-ownership of United midway through the season, but not early enough for the club to make any new player signings in January. He's been making additions elsewhere, though, much to the frustration of Newcastle United and Southampton in particular.",
      "United's efforts to land Newcastle director of football Dan Ashworth have not been received too kindly. The former Brighton chief is currently on gardening leave, with the Magpies adamant they won't be doing anything to make their rivals' job any easier.",
      "The next man being targeted as part of United's rebuild is Jason Wilcox, much to the anger of the former Blackburn winger's current club Southampton. The Championship club are at odds with United, in just the latest example of Ratcliffe's no-nonsense approach rubbing rivals up the wrong way.",
      "Not only are Southampton said to be angry with the timing of United's approach for Wilcox, but they are understood to reject the Premier League side's stance on a purported buyout clause for the 53-year-old. Sky Sports reports that United offered the equivalent to a year's salary for the executive, who joined Southampton last summer after serving a notice period from previous club Manchester City.",
      "The Championship outfit were made to wait for Wilcox, and value him more highly than the amount United appear to be prepared to offer. They insist the purported buyout clause doesn't exist, and remain frustrated by the fact the approach has come in the middle of a promotion push.",
      "Concerns from the Saints about Wilcox being unsettled come amid preparations for what could be a crucial summer at St Mary's. Southampton's hopes of automatic promotion were dealt a blow as they earned just one point from two games over the Easter weekend, and they'll face an important few months whether or not they return to the Premier League.",
      "Newcastle chief Ashworth was put on gardening leave in February, following earlier fears from Toon manager Eddie Howe that the former FA director of elite development could take secrets with him to Old Trafford. Ashworth's contract runs until 2026 and Newcastle are demanding £20m in compensation, much to Ratcliffe's frustration.",

      "Facundo Pellistri had a lot of excitement attached to him when he joined Manchester United from Uruguayan side Penarol in October 2020, but it has not gone to plan",
      "Facundo Pellistri arrived at Manchester United with plenty of hype behind him – but could leave this summer having failed to live up to it.",
      "Pellistri joined United in a £7.65million transfer from Uruguayan side Penarol in October 2020. The young winger signed a five-year contract but has struggled to establish himself and is currently out on loan in Granada, his third since joining United.",
      "Now 22 years old, he still has another year on his United deal, but it is looking increasingly unlikely that his future is at Old Trafford. New owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe will overhaul the United squad in the summer transfer window and wants to reduce the number of fringe players on the books.",
      "Pellistri has one goal and two assists in seven appearances for Granada, whom he joined in January, and will be hoping to earn a permanent move this summer. If that does come to pass then he can reflect upon a broken promise from his early days at United.",
      "Despite having only made 37 first-team appearances in Uruguay for Penarol, it was claimed that Pellistri was destined for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad upon arrival in Manchester. Evaristo Gonzalez, the secretary at Penarol, said at the time that United promised he would go \"straight into the first team.\"",
      "United were so keen to land Pellistri that Gonzalez told Uruguayan outlet Referi: \"In the talks with Manchester, at one point they told me: 'Due to the club's policy we don't pay for release clauses so we send the money to the club directly and you fix that problem.\"",
      "While Pellistri has made 24 first-team appearances for United and recorded two assists, his time at the club has been defined by frustration. It took him two years and three months to make his debut and he was twice sent out to Alaves on loan before landing at Granada in January.",
      "That is despite him making it clear that he wants to stay with United and push for a place in the side. Speaking on the pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia before the 2022/23 campaign, he explained: “I want to have the maximum continuity of minutes to try to arrive well.",
      "\"I’m not looking for a particular league. It’s easy to say ‘earn minutes’ because nobody promises them to you, and you have to earn them. It’s a complicated search, but I’m going to try to find the best option to play, show myself and feel good.\"",
      "Pellistri is clearly highly rated in his home country, with Uruguay handing him 19 caps already. After moving to Granada, he enjoyed a stand-out performance on February 11, scoring and assisting in a 3-3 draw with Barcelona. He will hope he can replicate such performances and catch the eye of clubs looking for wingers in the summer transfer window.",

      "“Just worrying signs really that you can get to that level of low in a performance,” the former England international said on The Gary Neville Podcast. “You think back to before the international break and where Manchester United were at. They had one of the most incredible moments and should be absolutely bouncing into Brentford.",
      "\"But then we saw what we saw. They won’t be that bad next week, they can’t be that bad. But if Liverpool do their jobs next week then Manchester United are going to be in a lot of trouble. There will be something different, it can’t get any worse.”",

Nice have had a turbulent time under Ratcliffe and co's regime, but this season started superbly and for a period looked set to challenge Paris Saint-Germain for the Ligue 1 title.",
      "But a nightmare run of just one win from eight games has left them fifth in the table, three points adrift of the Champions League places. Bulka, who's been one of Nice's better players during their dire run, spoke out following Saturday's 2-1 loss at home to relegation-battling Nantes and pointed the finger at his team-mates.",
      "\"I don't understand some attitudes in the team,\" the 24-year-old ex- Chelsea prospect is quoted as telling reporters post-match. \"We'll speak about it in the dressing room, not in front of the camera.\"",
      "Bulka, who's impressive form has seen him linked with a big-money move to United, then went on to say: \"I don't know if it is collective; I'd say it's about individuals. Everyone needs to look themselves in the eyes and ask themselves if they are showing desire. Today, for me, some of them showed that they didn't have that desire.\"",
      "The Poland international's comments were echoed by striker Evann Guessand, who told Prime Video Sport : \"It's true that something isn't working. We're not getting the results that we want.\"",
      "Francesco Farioli, 34, was appointed Nice's new manager by INEOS last summer and after a fantastic start to life in the south of France, he and his team have suffered a fall from grace. Club captain Dante was asked on Saturday whether the dressing room is \"still listening\" to Farioli, to which the Brazilian defender replied: \"Yes. Your question is very frank, and my response is too. I think it is too easy to have a go at the coach.\"",
      "Your turn! Will Sir Jim Ratcliffe succeed at Manchester United? Join the debate in the comments section.",

      "\"Results aside, this team has always shown character and desire. But in that first half, we didn't win a single duel, we didn't make a single pass with the desire to get a result. It was a very bad first half. In the second half, we had more desire, but we still lacked precision and clarity in our passing.\"",
      "When asked about Bulka's comments, Farioli responded: \"My answer is always the same. We win and lose with eleven men, plus the substitutes and the coach. There wasn't much to take away from the start of the first half, there wasn't much in the way of substance. That's down to individual and collective situations.

      "Wolves boss Gary O'Neil has been backed to succeed Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager.",
      "O'Neil has earned plaudits this season after taking charge of Wolves just days before the start of their Premier League campaign, having been ruthlessly sacked by Bournemouth. The former West Ham midfielder, 40, kept the Cherries up after a disastrous first half of the season, yet was still replaced last summer.",
      "His reputation has been further enhanced by his good work at Molineux and recent reports suggested that Manchester United are now keen on recruiting O'Neil to be part of current manager Erik ten Hag's coaching staff. Now amid Liverpool's ongoing search for a new boss, the Wolves head coach has been tipped to be a candidate.",

I think it could be a team that needs a younger coach who's used to working with younger players with not too much expectation to go and win the league. If someone like [Roberto] De Zerbi came in, we'd expect Liverpool to still be in the top four.\"",

Replacing Klopp in the Anfield hot seat would certainly be a much different challenge to the one which he took on at Wolves in August, having been brought in following Julen Lopetegui's acrimonious exit.",

      "There have been 53 confirmed cases of injury and illness that have caused a Man United player to miss a game this season.",
      "When an injured Lisandro Martinez still linked up with the Argentina squad in September, the word from Manchester United was it would be beneficial for him to be surrounded by his compatriots.",
      "A penny for Sir Alex Ferguson’s thoughts. Paul Scholes was omitted from an England squad on the Friday due to an upcoming hernia operation and played for United on the Monday against Middlesbrough. If Ferguson was the manager, Argentina nor Martinez would have dared ask the question.",
      "Martinez returned from South America, played twice and United lost both games against Brighton and Bayern Munich, conceding seven goals. Martinez underwent corrective surgery on a metatarsal fracture and did not play again until January.",
      "Times have changed and United have changed. Not for the better. Clubs should be selfish over a player’s availability yet Martinez, sidelined for six weeks, flew to Los Angeles a fortnight ago to train with his international teammates.",
      "Granted, his second-half introduction at Brentford was enforced. Raphael Varane was substituted as a precaution at the interval and Victor Lindelof sustained a hamstring injury in the second half.",
      "Yet this is the problem at United. There have been 53 separate cases of injury or illness that have caused a player to miss a game this season. Martinez returned before the eight-week timescale he was ruled out for with medial collateral ligament damage. Now he is out for another month.",
      "Since he first fractured his metatarsal against Sevilla last April, Martinez has started eight club games. The lucklessness of two impact injuries preceded a calf injury on Tuesday.",
      "The unwritten rule in sport is impact injuries are rotten luck but muscular strains are avoidable. It has been reported by this correspondent and others that some United players are concerned by the intense training demands of manager Erik ten Hag. Casemiro partly blamed it for a recurrence of the hamstring injury that caused him to miss the FA Cup win over Liverpool. Another player is understood to be playing within himself to avoid injury.",
      "Ten Hag brought an assistant coach and an analyst with him from Ajax but not a fitness coach. Louis van Gaal did and so did Jose Mourinho, a big believer in playing through the pain barrier and dismissive behaviour of certain physiological methods. It seems a grave oversight by Ten Hag when sources at Carrington say he treats recovery days more seriously than any of his predecessors.",
      "Marcus Rashford felt Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ran him into the ground and Ten Hag is not negligent. Returning players seldom complete 90 minutes on their return and Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Rasmus Hojlund were both substituted in the victory over Liverpool with United 2-1 down.",
      "But Ten Hag has taken needless risks. Starting Christian Eriksen against Championship relegation fodder Reading in the FA Cup last season resulted in an ankle injury, a ten-week absence and an 11th-hour loan move for Marcel Sabitzer.",
      "The scrutiny also has to be trailed on club doctor Gary O'Driscoll and Charlie Owen, the United fitness coach since March 2019. Owen replaced Robin Thorpe and Gary Walker and that summer Solskjaer instructed the fitness coaches to ensure the squad was the fittest it had ever been.",
      "Before the end of August, the flies started dropping. Luke Shaw, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were sidelined for the long term. O'Driscoll started at United in September after spending 14 years at Arsenal.",
      "Injury crises are nothing new at United. The physio’s room was crammed under Ferguson for the 2006-07 run-in and before Christmas in 2009 when United fielded a back three of Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Ritchie De Laet at Fulham. They lost 3-0.",
      "Ferguson hailed the opening of the Toshiba Medical Centre at Carrington in 2012 as “a big signing for us and probably the most important step forward we have taken in a long, long time”. United still started that season with Carrick at centre half away to Everton.",
      "Yet United remained competitive, winning the title in 2007 and 2013 and losing it by a point in 2010. Injuries have been rife at other elite clubs and players continue to reel from the backlog of fixtures since the Covid-19 pandemic. Nations League matches in mid-June 2022 and a senseless winter World Cup in Qatar have pushed players to the brink. A high-level source at United said earlier in the season Varane had told them “he can’t do it any more”.",
      "A depleted Liverpool still won the League Cup final, Tottenham schooled United at Old Trafford without five regulars and Manchester City are vying for a second Treble, having coped without Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland for prolonged periods. Ten Hag’s United have crumbled.",

      "The main dilemma comes in central defence with uncertainty over whether Raphael Varane should be risked after picking up a knock against Brentford. The Frenchman will be available against Mauricio Pochettino's side but starting him will be a risk, and with United's absentees in Varane's position, they can ill afford more injuries.",

      "READ MORE:Mount might get the chance to respond to his Chelsea chant",
      "Elsewhere, expect Casemiro to return in defensive midfield after starting on the bench against Brentford. The Brazilian may not offer the protection he provided last season, but he represents a more natural fit in that position alongside Kobbie Mainoo than Scott McTominay.",
      "Ten Hag may be tempted to rest 18-year-old Mainoo at some stage but the next two fixtures against Chelsea and Liverpool are vital when it comes to United's Champions League ambitions. Mason Mount may have scored his first United goal at the weekend but it is too soon to start the attacking midfielder after such a lengthy injury layoff.",
      "Despite creating next to nothing for much of the 90 minutes, United's best attack on paper remains Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund with Bruno Fernandes the creative force in midfield. Antony's performance as a substitute against Brentford did little to justify him starting against Chelsea.",

      "Man Utd head to Stamford Bridge on Thursday night for a battle between two clubs having disappointing seasons and undergoing change off the pitch.",
      "The Ineos revolution is continuing at speed at Old Trafford, with Manchester United now working on plans to appoint Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox into key roles within a new football structure at the club, with talks with Newcastle and Southampton aimed at bringing them in sooner rather than later.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is targeting people who are best-in-class to lead the change he wants to bring to a club with a staggering record of underperformance over the past decade. Ashworth is highly rated as an experienced sporting director and Wilcox is admired within the game and has had his credentials pushed forward by incoming United chief executive Omar Berrada.",
      "It looks like a strategy that can help restore success at Old Trafford and it's a clear improvement on the leadership offered by the Glazer family, who remain majority owners of the club but are very much taking a backseat. While they spent more than a decade focusing on internal hires, Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford are looking externally to bring in the best possible people for the job.",
      "But that alone is no guarantee of success, as they will find out on Thursday night when United head to Stamford Bridge for a fixture with a traditional 'top six' side in an even more chaotic state than them. Chelsea are on their third manager already in the Todd Boehly-Clearlake regime and at an executive level, the structure has been ripped up and redefined at least twice.",
      "A £1bn recruitment spree on the pitch was matched with a series of hires off it to shake up football operations, but it has produced a team that is now 11th in the Premier League and losing ground on the clubs they once measured themselves against. So disastrous has Boehly's reign been that he is now taking a backseat.",
      "The American billionaire appointed himself as interim sporting director in his first summer after buying the club, before appointing co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart. That pair had been hired from Brighton and Monaco as director of global talent and transfers and technical director to focus on football globally, before having their titles altered.",
      "Chelsea also recruited Kyle Macauley in an undefined recruitment role from Brighton, brought in Joe Shields from Southampton as co-director of recruitment and talent and Christopher Vivell from RB Leipzig as technical director. Vivell was then placed on gardening leave seven months after joining the club.",
      "In isolation, Chelsea hired shrewd operators within the industry to help drive their football operation, but in reality, the structure became ill-defined and there were too many significant voices contributing. For all the new roles, their recruitment has remained chaotic and the approach has been scattergun.",
      "Despite the unprecedented investment, Chelsea fans have turned against the Boehly regime and Mauricio Pochettino already. They have good personnel in place, but clearly, the structure isn't working.",
      "That should certainly serve as a warning for the key decision-makers at Ineos. Ratcliffe has only attended one game since his investment into the club, but he has been a regular at Stamford Bridge in the past and it's a game that is close to his base. As someone who bid for Chelsea during the auction that saw Boehly-Clearlake take over from Roman Abramovich, Ratcliffe will have kept a close eye on the events unfolding at Stamford Bridge.",
      "He is seeking to install best practice at United now, having learned his lessons in the football industry at Nice, who are now thriving in Ligue 1 after a difficult start under the Ineos umbrella. But as Ratcliffe and Brailsford build up their footballing infrastructure, the chaos that unfolded at Chelsea is a warning to make sure the hierarchy and the strategy are clearly defined.",

      "It transpired not even Mount was willing to speak, although he did do an interview with MUTV. \"If you look at the game overall it wasn't to our standard,\" he said. \"We know that. When you score at the death you think you can maybe hang on. But maybe we didn't deserve it.",
      "\"Brentford make it difficult. It is never easy coming here. They make it tough and get around you. Maybe we didn't get it going from the beginning. We know we can improve and we need to because we need to win games. We will improve, we will work hard. We need to step up.\"",
      "Mount, who came on from the bench with just minutes of normal time remaining, did brilliantly to score in added time, expertly finding the right corner whilst being pressured.",
      "He sprinted to the corner where the travelling fans were housed and slid on his knees, slapped the United badge on his shirt and was mobbed by his relieved teammates.",
      "Mount thought he'd won it but United conceded moments later, which made his goal redundant, so it was understandable he wanted to get on the bus as quickly as possible.",
      "Although it would have been one of the biggest robberies in Premier League history, Mount securing a late winner would have represented the turning point of his time at United.",
      "The points were shared, but the goal must be the turning point regardless and starting Mount against his former club Chelsea on Thursday seems like a no-brainer.",
      "Mount's time in Manchester since signing from Chelsea for £55million, with a potential £5m in add-ons, hasn't gone to plan, albeit there is still plenty of time to turn it around.",
      "Erik ten Hag has followed Mount's career since his loan spell in the Eredivisie with Vitesse in the 2017/2018 season and, rightly or wrongly, he made the 25-year-old his priority midfield signing last summer, to freshen up the centre of the pitch and provide energy.",
      "Mount's cameo against Liverpool before the break went under the radar due to the extraordinary manner of the victory, but he provided exactly what he was signed for - energy.",
      "His introduction against Brentford almost won United the game and starting him on the bench at Stamford Bridge would disrupt the momentum he's been able to build.",
      "Mount has not started in the Premier League since picking up a calf injury against Luton Town on November 11 and he should make the starting XI for the first time in five months.",
      "Where he starts on the pitch is the contentious point. Mount was signed to play in a deeper midfield role, but the prospect of him starting alongside Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes against Chelsea doesn't inspire confidence that United won't be overrun again.",
      "While Casemiro has been disappointing this season and his drop-off has been stark, the midfield is only balanced when he plays and the defensive line is exposed when he doesn't.",
      "Casemiro must start against Chelsea and Mainoo shouldn't lose his place, which means Mount should either play on the right wing or in central attacking midfield.",
      "Mount made his name as a No.10, a creative attacking midfielder and he's most comfortable in that role, so perhaps Fernandes should be relocated and Alejandro Garnacho rested.",
      "Garnacho has run through brick walls this season, but fatigue looks to have crept into his performances in recent weeks and he would benefit from a rest.",
      "Mount playing behind Rasmus Hojlund, with Fernandes on the right, might be the best choice.",

      "The Man United players slept in their own beds the night before the Brentford fixture and had a nap on the day of it. Then they sleepwalked through the game.",
      "Manchester United had two team meetings at their hotel in London before they were ferried to the Community Stadium on Saturday evening. Their performance suggested few players were listening.",
      "They also napped at their hotel. United then sleepwalked through 90-odd minutes until Mason Mount committed daylight robbery.",
      "Although United were minutes from victory yet drew, their performance warrants assessment through the prism of defeat. They were battered and bullied by a team that has won two of their last 18 games. There were also victories for Tottenham and Aston Villa, now so distant they are nearly a mirage.",
      "\"Don't lower the performances from Brentford,\" Erik ten Hag bristled. \"I have seen them against Man City and City was also lucky to win that game. And against Liverpool in the first 35 minutes Brentford should have taken the lead. So don't express this.\"",
      "It has been noticeable since Sir Jim Ratcliffe was the sole bidder left at the table that Ten Hag's rhetoric has changed. As critical as he was of United's lack of \"passion and desire in many moments\" at Brentford, he also opined it could be a \"big point\".",
      "The City revisionism was bizarre. Brentford went 1-0 up through the rarity that is a Neal Maupay goal but City were level by half-time and ahead within eight minutes of the restart. They racked up 15 attempts on target.",
      "Brentford were unmistakably Brentford against United: a back three, wing-backs, physical, primed to press and a nuisance at set-pieces. That was in spite of the absences of Ben Mee, Ethan Pinnock, Aaron Hickey, captain Christian Nørgaard and Rico Henry. They started with their third-choice left wing-back.",
      "United were recognisably unrecognisable. No style and still mired in an identity crisis. Ten Hag blindly named an unchanged team and blind faith is the only consistent thread with United's approach.",
      "The grin on Steve McClaren's face as Mount charged towards the away end was so broad he thought United had got away with it again. Once McClaren had calmed down, he turned to the pitch and pointed at his temples. That was another message that did not get across to the players.",
      "Emotion dictated Ten Hag's selections and that is another tell-tale sign his methods are failing. United's raucous victory over Liverpool was sparked by a substitute and won by another substitute. At Brentford, their scorer was also a substitute.",
      "Victor Lindelof is not quick, not durable and aerially vulnerable, so he was pitted against Ivan Toney. Raphael Varane was United's most accomplished performer in the first half, so Toney pulled onto Lindelof as Rodrigo Muniz did in Fulham's victory. Lindelof is a pushover for physical frontmen.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka seldom resembles a modern right back yet continued at left back. Ten Hag turned in disgust at his positioning after the ball was played in behind Wan-Bissaka. Rewatch Brentford's equaliser and United have a near-perfectly choreographed defensive line to trap Toney offside. Apart from Wan-Bissaka, who is two yards deeper.",
      "Scott McTominay is a moments squad player whose goalscoring impacts have come either off the bench or in charged atmospheres. Only his robustness can account for why he played more than 100 minutes at Brentford.",
      "Ten Hag berated Antony for pressing high, offered encouraging applause in response to Marcus Rashford's miscontrol and had to shout \"Bruno\" at least three times before Fernandes heard and was summoned to the touchline for a conflab. That was midway through the first half.",
      "\"I'm not happy with the performance,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"There is no misunderstanding, the players are also disappointed by the performance and we should be consistent in the game, go in the game, perform and show more aggressiveness.\"",
      "Ten Hag has repeatedly highlighted United's respectable performances against the top four (a narrow defeat to Arsenal, a creditable draw with Liverpool and wins against Aston Villa) in contrast to their level against those in the bottom half of the table. Fulham, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest have all beaten United, who are away to Bournemouth and Palace in the coming weeks.",
      "As gutting as the equaliser will have been for the 1,725 supporters in the north-east corner, they have become accustomed to this. Wolves levelled in the 95th minute against United two months ago and Fulham prevailed through a winner in the same minute more recently.",
      "United have conceded 13 goals within 10 minutes of scoring this season and there have been 26 goals scored from the 80th minute onwards in their 90-minute matches. Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Wolves, Fulham and Brentford have struck in added time.",
      "The directive for officials to increase added time has predictably resulted in more goals beyond the 90th minute. This Premier League season is already a record for stoppage-time goals.",
      "Had Kristoffer Ajer not occupied the void where United's midfield ought to have been, Mount would have recorded a club-record fifth 'Fergie Time' victory in a single campaign. In the Treble season, United secured two wins of that vintage.",
      "Since Steve Bruce delivered the birth of Fergie Time against Sheffield Wednesday 31 years ago, United have scored 47 stoppage time goals and the four this season is the joint-highest. The only other campaign United forced rewrites in the press box was in 2018-19.",
      "Three of those four triumphs came with Jose Mourinho in the dugout during his final months. That in itself is a red flag with Ten Hag's own future in the balance.",
      "As laudable a hallmark as it is, frequent late wins are unsustainable. United have secured a meagre six victories by a margin of two goals or more since August. Two were against League One and League Two sides in the FA Cup and another was in the League Cup on a night Palace hit the eject button themselves.",
      "It is a quirk of Ferguson's tenure that after Bruce's heroics, United did not claim a 90-something-minute decider again until Andy Cole's adroit header at Roker Park in January 1996. Then there was another three-year wait for the bedlam of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Scousebusting against Liverpool, the day the Treble became topical and was splashed across the following morning's back pages.",
      "As evocative as the late finishes were, they were spread across Ferguson's reign. Consistent performance levels, dependable goalscorers and solid foundations were key to Ferguson's longevity and United's dominance. This United are found wanting on all three.",

      "He has also been shining for England's U-17 side during the international break, scoring twice as a substitute in a 5-1 win over Northern Ireland. The forward struck again against Hungary on his full debut, scoring the opening goal in a 5-0 win.",

      "Only three teams have conceded more shots than United in the Premier League this season and two of those, Sheffield United and Luton Town, are in the relegation zone.",
      "United have faced more shots in the league (498) than Manchester City and Arsenal combined. Wherever you look, the unwanted records are stacking up, including United and Sheffield United being the only teams to concede 30+ shots in more than one league game this season.",
      "Brentford had 85 touches in United's penalty box and created 3.11 expected goals. The numbers make for grim reading and Ten Hag has continued to play the problem down.",
      "When asked after the Brentford game whether he was concerned by the number of shots United are conceding, Ten Hag said: “As long as we get results, no. I think our results are quite consistent from January on. We concede shots but we don’t concede many goals.\"",
      "Ten Hag has been asked that almost every week and his answer hasn't changed, but alarm bells should be ringing if he believes conceding a flurry of shots isn't a problem.",
      "Although the Dutchman has argued United are conceding low probability chances, they add up and allowing the opposition to create so many openings is asking for trouble.",
      "United should be a proactive side, they should control games and restrict the opposition's chances to score. Ten Hag has spent over £400million and his side is the antithesis of that, which adds weight to the argument there should be an amicable handshake in the summer.",
      "Ten Hag's denial of the problem is bizarre and it's even more concerning that he's been unable to fix it, with the same problem having been seen throughout the campaign.",
      "Some key players have been unavailable, but it's a structural issue, as the press is often dysfunctional and there are pockets of space between the defence and midfield.",
      "There's been enough time on the training ground to address the problem and, unfortunately, United will continue to be the kings of inconsistency until something changes.",
      "The 2021/22 season was the worst in the club's modern history and yet, United have fewer points, fewer goals and have conceded the same number of goals after 29 games this term.",
      "United have gone spectacularly backwards and there's been a noticeable shift in fan opinion over whether Ten Hag is the right manager for the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era.",
      "Ten Hag isn't helping himself by failing to address some of the biggest problems.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",

      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",

Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher have appeared in the FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League for Man United already this season and are only still 16.",
      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

Ten Hag’s bold approach to win the ball high up the pitch looks great when done correctly, but they look exposed when teams beat their press.",
      "Giving away possession cheaply makes United architects of their own downfall, something that has happened plenty of times this season, leading to unnecessary goals. Ten Hag will be scrambling for a solution as the season enters the final phase.",

      "United travel to Stamford Bridge on Thursday night to face Chelsea in West London. After that, the Reds will host bitter rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford this weekend in two games that could be defining in the club's season.",
      "Amid the uncertainty on the field for United, away from the pitch, the club are continuing to be linked with potential new signings. The latest rumours suggest that a centre-back and a midfielder are of interest to the Reds.",
      "According to Sky Germany, United are showing an interest in signing Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. The centre-back has been linked with a move to Old Trafford ever since the January transfer window, and the rumours are continuing to swirl in the final weeks of the season.",
      "The report has claimed that Bremer is a player who has been scouted by United ahead of the summer window, with a reported valuation of between €50million-€60million (£42.8m-£51.4m). However, it has been stated that, despite the interest, there have been no advanced talks over a deal to bring Bremer to Old Trafford, with the reported asking price supposedly an issue.",
      "Elsewhere, United are continuing to be linked with a move for Benfica midfielder Joao Neves.",
      "According to Portuguese news outlet Record, Neves is a \"priority\" target for United ahead of the summer transfer window. The midfielder has also been linked with Liverpool and Chelsea in recent weeks.",
      "The report claims that United are prepared to break their transfer record to sign Neves, which is currently the £89 million paid to sign Paul Pogba from Juventus in 2016. It has been stated that the Reds have set aside more than €100 million (£86 million) to try and sign Neves when the window reopens.",
      "Neves is widely reported to have a release clause in his contract at Benfica worth €120 million (£103 million). Benfica are likely to be unwilling to allow Neves to leave for a fee below the release clause, having stood firm with their negotiations for Enzo Fernandez, who eventually joined Chelsea after his €121 million (£103.6 million) release clause was activated.",

      "Andre Onana had a baptism of fire after joining Manchester United from Inter Milan last summer, with a series of high-profile mistakes raising serious questions about his ability.",
      "Undoubtedly, Onana was the perfect fit for Erik ten Hag due to his ability to play out from the back, effectively operating as an 11th outfielder. He made more accurate long passes (116) than any other player in the Champions League last season.",
      "But just 25 days after joining the club, Onana’s blushes were spared on his debut against Wolves, clattering through Sasa Kalajdzic in the closing stages after missing a punch. It was erratic, to say the least.",
      "The 27-year-old made more glaring errors, most notably in the Champions League where tame efforts squirmed under his body. He was making the headlines for all the wrong reasons.",
      "Fast forward to April and Onana has turned a corner after a difficult start to life in England. David de Gea suffered similar teething problems after he signed in the summer of 2011 from Atletico Madrid.",
      "It’s worth remembering that Sir Alex Ferguson jumped to the defence of De Gea in the early months of his United career. Onana was given similar backing from Ten Hag and he's coming good for his boss.",
      "By Onana’s own admission, it has taken “six or seven months” to reach his level after a difficult period at the club. He added: “My teammates, my players, they always reminded me who I am and the goalkeeper I am and why I came to this club.”",
      "Onana has shown he can spray passes like a midfielder, but it's his ability with his hands, rather than his feet, that is proving the doubters wrong after much more consistent displays.",
      "In the recent draw away at Brentford, the hosts peppered United with 31 shots. Onana had to make crucial saves to prevent his side from going behind.",
      "He has an air of confidence now, with his commanding presence in the box also helping to launch breakaways for United. His ability to get United on the front foot was something they lacked last season.",
      "There’ll still be nervy moments as he’s such a brave goalkeeper and the injury issues in defence this season must be taken into account when assessing his first term with the Reds.",

He said it was 'really difficult' to play as badly as they did and if the London side hadn't grabbed a late equaliser he would have started a petition to 'give them two points back'.",

      "\"It was absolute robbery. But then Brentford score. I can't explain that performance, I've no idea where it comes from. Very worrying that you can go to that level of low. You know you can play badly in football, you know you sometimes don't feel quite right.",

      "Manchester United's performance against Brentford raised a question about manager Erik ten Hag on Match of the Day",
      "A Match of the Day pundit has questioned Erik ten Hag’s tactics after Manchester United’s draw with Brentford.",
      "United looked to have grabbed a late winner through Mason Mount’s goal in west London before an almost immediate equaliser from Kristoffer Ajer. The point moved the club eight points behind Tottenham Hotspur in fifth, damaging United’s hopes of achieving Champions League qualification.",
      "Ten Hag’s side had celebrated an uplifting and dramatic cup win over rivals Liverpool before the international break but there was no sense of that momentum in the team’s latest display. Brentford had a remarkable 31 shots on goal and Match of the Day pundit Stephen Warnock slammed the United for their contrasting performances and questioned Ten Hag for not changing his tactics.",
      "“You can’t go from beating Liverpool and then be poor,” Warnock said. “Their style of play, they went long ball, time after time. If you’re the manager, correct that on the pitch. Is he strong enough to do that? He didn’t show it today.”",
      "United appeared to have turned a corner at the start of 2024, winning four of their first five league games. However, the team have since only won one of their last four in the league, losing ground on Aston Villa and Spurs in the race for a Champions League place. In his post-match interview, Ten Hag admitted that his side would have been fortunate to earn three points.",
      "\"We didn't deserve to win but if you're winning you have to take this,\" Ten Hag said. \"I would say normally we are good in such circumstances if we score before time.",
      "\"We showed resilience all through the game but in points of aggressiveness Brentford were better, we should show more passion and desire in many moments in the game. But when you are winning you should bring it over the line.”",

      "Manchester United would turn into Premier League title challengers if they signed Ivan Toney, according to the Peterborough United chairman who signed the forward six years ago.",
      "The 28-year-old Brentford striker has scored four goals in 11 Premier League games since returning from an eight-month ban for breaching the Football Association's gambling laws. Since firing the Bees to promotion in May 2021, Toney has scored 36 goals in 77 Premier League outings.",
      "Toney, who has less than 18 months remaining on his current deal at Brentford, has been linked with moves to Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and West Ham in recent weeks. However, Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony believes Toney could turn Erik ten Hag's side into title challenges should he make the move to Old Trafford and would prove value for money, even at £100m.",
      "Speaking on Sky Sports, MacAnthony, who signed Toney for the Posh from Newcastle United in 2018, said: \"Put him in an Arsenal team, put him in a Liverpool or a Man United team, he scores 30 Premier League goals in a season. I think anyone who disagrees with that hasn't been watching the last two-and-a-half years.",
      "\"I think there are five clubs in the world who could probably end up buying him and he will improve any of those clubs by a mile. He turns Manchester United into challengers for the Premier League.\"",
      "Toney was a thorn in United's side at the Gtech Community Stadium last Saturday as he laid on a stoppage-time assist for Kristoffer Ajer to equalise against the Reds, and MacAnthony believes the two-cap England international will only get better in the years ahead.",
      "\"Having scouted players not just for their technical ability but their personality and their growth for 18 years, I think he's not even in his prime even though he's turning 28,\" added the 48-year-old. \"Whoever buys him, £100m will be well spent because he's coming into his prime. You're going to get five or six years of his best.",
      "\"He's scored a goal every other game in the Premier League for Brentford. Put Ivan in an Aston Villa team under [Unai] Emery and see how many goals he scores in the Premier League. He'd probably be up there for the Golden Boot.\"",
      "Ten Hag's side have struggled for goals this season, with only Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Burnley, Everton and Sheffield United managing fewer than United's 40 in the Premier League.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay are the club's leading scorers in the Premier League this season (7), while Champions League rivals Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur are able to boast the prolificacy of Ollie Watkins (16) and Son Heung-Min (15).",

      "Man Utd have approached Southampton about their director of football Jason Wilcox as Ineos continue to restructure the football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "When Rio Ferdinand bumped into Darren Fletcher in the Carrington gym recently while filming a feature on Manchester United for TV, he asked his former teammate the question he claimed all his mates wanted to know: 'What, exactly, is your role then?'",
      "It wasn't aimed to belittle Fletcher or to downplay his contributions at United, but in football's modern world of made-up job titles, technical director doesn't really describe the former midfielder's work within the confines of Carrington. This has been a talking point for a couple of years now, one that Fletcher attempted to nip in the bud with an explanation during Ralf Rangnick's ill-fated spell, when he had the tracksuit on and became a more visible presence on matchday.",
      "\"Technical director is my title, but for me, I'm part of the first-team coaching staff, but as a support coach,\" he said. \"My link with the first team is a link for the under-21s, so the pathway of the young players training with the first team.\"",
      "As Ineos rip up the football structure at Old Trafford it remains to be seen where Fletcher is going to slot in, but his job title is now set to go to Jason Wilcox, with United approaching Southampton to appoint their director of football. With Dan Ashworth set to come in as sporting director, Wilcox will report to the former Newcastle executive as part of a new structure.",
      "His exact role will need to be defined, but it is unlikely to have as prominent a focus on recruitment as he currently enjoys at St Mary's, where he is highly valued. But the Premier League title winner with Blackburn Rovers has experience across a range of roles, having been academy director at Manchester City, where he worked with United's incoming chief executive Omar Berrada. The pair were close at the Etihad and it is understood Berrada recommended Wilcox to United for a senior role.",
      "He was credited with having a significant impact on the success of the academy, having also coached the under-18s. And when City considered releasing Cole Palmer at the age of 16, it was Wilcox who pushed for the club to keep him. He was also an old-school presence at City's academy, insisting on players wearing black boots, thanking staff and ensuring people tidied up after themselves.",
      "His experiences at City and Southampton show his versatility in recruitment and academy circles. Ineos' desire to appoint him is their latest move in bringing best in class operators to overhaul their football structure, with Sir Dave Brailsford overseeing it.",
      "That is likely to see changes internally as well, with new roles or departures for John Murtough and Fletcher. Wilcox might finally bring some clarity to the role of technical director.",

      "Ineos are showing the ambition to return Man Utd to the top of the tree in English football but Erik ten Hag isn't matching it with his own comments.",
      "Off the pitch at Old Trafford there is the unmistakable sense of ambition in the air. After more than a decade of stagnation under the Glazer family, Sir Jim Ratcliffe is in a hurry to start turning Manchester United back into Manchester United.",
      "The recruitment of Omar Berrada from Manchester City as chief executive was a clear signal that Ratcliffe wanted to bring in the best-in-class to start running this football club. Dan Ashworth has been identified as sporting director and an approach has been made to recruit Jason Wilcox. Both Ashworth and Wilcox are highly regarded within the game.",
      "Berrada’s gardening leave doesn’t allow him to start at United until the summer and negotiations to bring in Ashworth and Wilcox are ongoing, but Ineos are ripping up the football structure and changes are afoot. The one department as yet untouched is the manager’s office but change is coming, not least in terms of the plaque that sits on the door.",
      "Head coach is going to be a more likely title as Ineos settles on a structure more commonly associated with clubs on the continent. They have finally found success at Nice this season and they aren’t the only Premier League owners or investors trying to wean English clubs off a system that hands significant power to the manager.",
      "That restructuring is bound to have an impact on Erik ten Hag one way or the other, whether he accepts staying on in a role with a slightly different power dynamic, decides to walk away or fails to come up with the performances to convince Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford he is the man for the job. The thrilling FA Cup win against Liverpool was a day to remind Ineos of the upside around Ten Hag.",
      "The 53-year-old can get supporters’ on side and is capable of producing results like that quarter-final triumph. But then came the dreadful draw at Brentford and a display that must have made Ratcliffe and Brailsford question the credentials of the man in charge of the club they are now overseeing.",
      "Not only were United outplayed and outthought at the Gtech Community Stadium, but Ten Hag’s public comments are starting to sound out of kilter with the ambition being aired by Ratcliffe, both in public and in private. Instead, excuses have become a regular occurrence at United press conferences and the claim on Saturday night that Manchester City had similar trouble with the Bees was the latest example. It sounded like an attempt to buy United some leeway, but it was patently untrue.",
      "Brentford had 31 shots against United. In two games against City this season they have had 15. Their xG on Saturday was 3.2 in 90 minutes, while against City it stands at 1.4 across 180 minutes.",
      "Ten Hag was talking about City’s 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium in February when Brentford took the lead in the first half and caused Pep Guardiola’s side a few problems. But City responded, had 25 shots of their own, racked up an xG of 2.1 and won 3-1.",
      "That was during a run of 12 defeats in 14 Premier League games for Brentford but, according to Ten Hag, they should have had more. That might be true, but that night wasn’t one of them.",
      "\"Don't lower the performances from Brentford,\" Ten Hag said. \"I have seen them against Man City and City was also lucky to win that game.”",
      "City weren’t lucky to win that game. Once they worked Brentford out and got control of it, they were dominant and Phil Foden scored a hat-trick. United were certainly lucky to avoid defeat on Saturday. They never found a way to stop the hosts.",
      "Maybe Ten Hag’s comparison with the City game was intended to offer praise to Brentford and it’s certainly the case that they've had some games where performances have made recent results look like an anomaly. But it was a clumsy way of trying to make the point and only served to sound like another excuse being offered for a desperate United performance - something that is happening all to often of late.",
      "Indeed Ten Hag claimed the defeat at the Etihad was down to “small margins” when Manchester City won the derby 3-1 and had 27 shots to United’s three. Having looked and sounded the part as a Manchester United manager last season, Ten Hag is conveying the wrong message now.",
      "He has found it harder to strike the right balance in a season of struggle. Last term he was critical of his team every time standards dropped significantly, an approach that didn't always go down well in the dressing room.",
      "He has taken a conscious decision to tone down that criticism this season, but has now gone too far the other way. The performance on Saturday was among the worst of the season, but rather than an acceptance of that the United manager only offered up tame excuses and attempts to overstate how difficult an assignment this was.",
      "Since Christmas and the Ineos investment the parameters have changed at Old Trafford and the current manager has to reflect that. More ambition is required, and fewer excuses.",

      "Omar Berrada has been appointed as CEO by Man United with further approaches made for Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox.",
      "Manchester United are pressing ahead with formative plans to restructure the footballing operations department at Old Trafford following investment from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS Group. His £1.25billion deal was formalised on Christmas Eve and subsequently ratified by the Premier League in February.",
      "Since then, United have started to shake things up behind-the-scenes. Omar Berrada swapped blue for red - even before Ratcliffe was officially sworn in to the boardroom - and the former Manchester City figure will become CEO.",
      "With that move confirmed, United have also made approaches for Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox, who currently operates as director of football at Southampton, but would become technical director at United. Ashworth is a prime target as sporting director and is currently serving a period of gardening leave.",
      "Formal discussions between United and Newcastle for Ashworth have been held. Attempts to appoint Wilcox are, seemingly, a little further down the line after he was recommended for a position by incoming CEO Berrada.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands - as reported in February - that INEOS want Ashworth to head up their footballing department and report to Berrada with a team to be assembled around their sporting director. Wilcox is being identified for wide ranging role in support of Ashworth, while further appointments are expected.",
      "Berrada was appointed to replace Richard Arnold as CEO after he stood down when INEOS Group finalised the 25 per cent investment. The new co-owners wanted someone as well-versed in football as business and that plan led them to Berrada, who spent eight years at Barcelona prior to his time at City.",
      "Negotiations between United and Newcastle continue over Ashworth and the 53-year-old wants to join the club. Compensation for his services is the primary stumbling block with Ratcliffe branding Newcastle \"silly\", \"stupid\" and \"absurd\" for reportedly demanding as much as £20million for Ashworth. United sources previously declared they would not pay £10million to recruit Ashworth.",
      "The club are prepared to play the waiting game for Ashworth, but are also ready to start work on assembling the team that would work around him - including Wilcox - who is admired by people at INEOS and also worked closely with Berrada during their time together at City.",
      "In effect, there would be a straight line running between Berrada, Ashworth and Wilcox in the top positions, with Ashworth heading up the footballing department and Wilcox fulfilling a role beneath him. United are said to have offered Southampton a full year's salary as would-be compensation for Wilcox.",

      "Man Utd were battered again at the weekend but despite Brentford having 31 shots they conceded only once at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "When a goalkeeper moves to a new club he will always be keen to make an impression and to have some work to do, but even Andre Onana must be getting a bit sick of this.",
      "In his last 11 games for his club, he has faced 237 shots, at an average of 21.5 a game. It is a monstrous workload for a goalkeeper and one more akin to a team battling relegation than one trying to get back into the Champions League.",
      "Manchester United's hopes are fading on that front but that they are still alive at all is due in large part to Onana, who has grown into his role as the club's new No.1 this season and is now one of the best players in Erik ten Hag's team. Like Lisandro Martinez, this is a deal to sign one of his former players that looks well-judged.",
      "That wasn't the widely held view at the start of the season, when Onana looked hesitant and nervous in the United goal, making a string of mistakes in a disastrous Champions League group campaign. But he has recovered his poise admirably and as a shot-stopper, he has proven his worth since his £47million move from Inter Milan.",
      "In those previous 11 games, Onana has faced 66 shots on target but only 16 have beaten him. United's Premier League discrepancy between the number of goals they have conceded (40) and their xG of 53 is the highest such gap in the league. Only Thomas Kaminski and Alphonse Areola have made more saves than Onana's 108 in the league this season.",
      "His fine form was on display again on Saturday night, keeping Brentford at bay despite seeing his goal peppered with a barely believable 31 shots. That United didn't leave West London having lost the game was mostly down to their goalkeeper.",
      "Onana's form has silenced those doubts over whether the right call was made to jettison David de Gea last season, ending his 12-year stay at the club. The Spaniard was a reliable No.1 for most of his time at the club, but his standards had dipped. He was making more and more errors and his work in possession was always going to be an issue for a manager keen to build from the back.",
      "That is an area Onana excels in and we still haven't seen the best out of it at United. The changing cast of defenders in front of him has made it difficult to develop patterns of play and work on build-up play. If the goalkeeper can get regular game time with an injury-free Martinez and Luke Shaw then United's work in possession would improve considerably.",
      "Pep Guardiola believes Onana is one of the best goalkeepers in the world when it comes to helping with the build-up and the Catalan places great importance on 'keepers who can use their feet, but Onana might not truly show what he can do in that department until next season, by which time he might have a new manager.",
      "Ten Hag is certainly fighting for his future at Old Trafford and while he will be delighted with the performances of the goalkeeper he pushed to sign in the summer, he will know he needs him to have a few quieter games if he's to prove to Ineos he is the man for the job.",
      "But even if he does depart this summer, he will leave his successor a few gems, in Martinez, in Kobbie Mainoo and it increasingly looks like in Onana too.",
      "The question when he signed was why United had spent £47m on a goalkeeper they could have had on a free transfer a year ago, but the doubts around De Gea only grew as the season went on. As it turns out, even at £47m, the 27-year-old is looking like a wise investment. He's been a bright spot in a season of disappointment.",

There would be merit in giving him a short-term deal, but United could allow him to go for free and invest his wages into signing a new, younger centre-back worthy of starting.",
      "His injury record must be considered. Varane has struggled with far too many fitness concerns over the last few years and that ultimately might be the deciding factor.",
      "United would miss Varane - as they did when he was substituted - if he leaves.",

      "Man United took on Brentford in the Premier League and here are how the players rated at the Community Stadium.",
      "Manchester United had a tough evening at the Gtech Community Stadium when they took on Brentford in a difficult, bruising encounter. It ended 1-1 after late drama.",
      "Erik ten Hag sent out the same starting XI that beat Liverpool so famously in the FA Cup a fortnight ago, but this was anything but a similar performance. Instead of the energy and attacking enthusiasm, United were pushed back by a Brentford side struggling near the bottom of the table.",
      "Here's how the players rated:",
      "Andre Onana",
      "His direct kicking did not work but he made an excellent double save early in the second half to keep the scoreline 0-0 and prompt Erik ten Hag to celebrate. 8",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Started sloppily and not at the level of his pre-internationals form all night. Had little help in front of him from starting and substitute wingers. 5",
      "Raphael Varane",
      "United's best player in the first half and his positioning thwarted a couple of Brentford opportunities. But he succumbed to another injury and came off at the pause. 6",
      "Victor Lindelof",
      "Was palpably uncomfortable up against the imposing Ivan Toney. Made one key intervention but was possibly relieved when he was forced off injured. 5",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka",
      "Looked like what he was: a right back at left back. His positioning was consistently errant and offered Brentford ample encouragement. Somehow lasted the whole game. 2",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Started decently but faded in the first half as Brentford got a foothold and could have done with Casemiro next to him. 5",
      "Scott McTominay",
      "A passenger for 45 minutes in a game that he should not have started. Brentford were not as obliging as Liverpool were against McTominay. 2",
      "Alejandro Garnacho",
      "Did not get into the game and had a hissy fit when he failed to get the ball off Wan-Bissaka. Came off early in the second half for Antony. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "A subdued performance after he went a week without playing to get extra rest. Might now have wished he had travelled to Slovenia with Portugal. 4",
      "Marcus Rashford",
      "Had United's only attempt on target in the first half but his errant touch into touch typified their performance and he was seldom a threat. 3",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "Anonymous against Brentford's back three in the first half. Had a great chance to make it 1-0 early in the second but brilliantly denied by Mark Flekken. 4",
      "Subs",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Beefed up United's backline but they were no more dominant. 6",
      "Antony",
      "Took an age to get on the ball and when he did he went close with a curling shot. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Returned from an eight-week lay-off. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Gave away a foul just outside the area. Then assisted Mount. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Almost the matchwinner. 8",
      "Manager",
      "Mistakenly named an unchanged side when he had the options to field a better and more balanced XI. Did not make a tactical substitution at the interval when one was needed. His changes eventually had an impact. 6",

      "\"We showed resilience all through the game but in points of aggressiveness Brentford were better, we should show more passion and desire in many moments in the game. But when you are winning you should bring it over the line.",

      "\"That is my big disappointment - that we didn't bring it over the line. We didn't play well but there was spirit, there was fight, but not enough. It was enough to get the goal, 1-0, and before that we had a big chance for Rasmus Hojlund.\"",
      "Ten Hag downplayed the high number of efforts Brentford had at the United goal. Brentford's 31 shots were three fewer than the 34 unleashed by Liverpool against United at Anfield - the highest in the Premier League since records began.",
      "\"As long as we get results, no?\" Ten Hag said. \"I explained it once more: we defended low by times and because Brentford are very direct we lost many many second balls and we had to defend the box.",
      "\"We had a great goalkeeper, he was brilliant tonight, we have to say that also. Our results are quite consistent from January on. We concede shots but we don't concede so many goals.",

      "\"Don't lower the performances from Brentford,\" Ten Hag complained.\" I have seen them against Man City and City was also lucky to win that game. And against Liverpool, in the first 35 minutes Brentford should have taken the lead, so don't express this.",
      "\"We should have done this better, I'm not happy with the performance, there is no misunderstanding, the players are also disappointed by the performance and we should be consistent in the game, go in the game, perform and show more aggressiveness.\"",

      "Manchester United are back",
      "Manchester United's win against Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup will be remembered for decades and that result provided momentum going into the match against Brentford.",
      "Thomas Frank's side had won just two of their last 17 games and United were expected to return from the international break with a victory, but you cannot trust this side to deliver.",
      "It's not hyperbole to suggest they are one of the most inconsistent sides in Europe, never mind the Premier League, and a struggling Brentford side dominated the match.",
      "United lost 4-0 at Gtech Community Stadium last season and Erik ten Hag managed to inspire a remarkable turnaround, qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Carabao Cup.",
      "However, United have regressed this season and they didn't play much better back at the scene of the crime. It was stunning Brentford weren't leading at half-time and the home fans were scratching their heads in disbelief as they left their seats at the interval.",
      "United didn't deserve to win. The draw was a fair result and a reality check for the progress of this team. Ten Hag can argue it's been a successful campaign if the Reds qualify for the Champions League and win the FA Cup, but matchgoing fans have watched far too many awful performances.",
      "United's top four hopes",
      "Tottenham completed a 2-1 comeback against Luton Town and Aston Villa won 2-0 against Wolves on Saturday. Both of those sides are hoping to qualify for the Champions League this season and their results increased the pressure on United at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "When United emerged from the dressing room to warm up, they were nine points behind Tottenham and they trailed Villa by 12 points, which made the game a must-win.",
      "The state of play made the performance even more disappointing. United were so poor and yet, they almost pulled it out of the fire at the death after a goal from Mason Mount, who understandably thought he'd won the three points with a brilliant finish.",
      "United must improve if they want to feature in Europe's premium competition in 2024/25.",
      "How didn't Brentford win?",
      "Brentford created 31 shots against United and were denied by the crossbar and post on a few different occasions, so it was remarkable they didn't score until added time.",
      "United have developed a habit of conceding far too many shots and although Ten Hag has played down the problem in press conferences, it needs to be urgently addressed.",
      "There is far too much space between the defensive line and midfield for the opposition to take advantage of and that indicates there is a structural, tactical problem.",
      "Audition for Toney?",
      "Before the game, there were quotes from Brentford's technical director discussing Ivan Toney's future published and he admitted a sale of the striker is likely this summer.",
      "Although Toney only recently returned from his gambling ban, he's flirted with the possibility of a transfer away in several interviews and it seems inevitable he'll be on the move.",
      "Impressively, Toney scored 20 goals in 33 Premier League starts last season and, without being disrespectful, he's clearly a level above Brentford. Which club he leaves for in the summer will be fascinating and being a proven goalscorer in the Premier League makes him an asset.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has blossomed in 2024 but United need to sign another striker at the end of the season. The 21-year-old has almost single-handedly shouldered the burden of finding the back of the net on his young shoulders and another striker is required to ease the load.",
      "Whether someone of the calibre of Toney could be signed remains to be seen. He isn't short of confidence and seems to have the personality to play in a red shirt.",
      "South Americans are back",
      "Casemiro and Lisandro Martinez returned to the squad after their respective absences but they were both named on the bench. It was great to see them back and involved regardless.",
      "The worst was feared when Martinez went to the ground against West Ham on February 4, but it was subsequently confirmed he'd sustained a medial collateral ligament injury. That meant he didn't require surgery and his return as the business end of the season arrives is welcome.",
      "It was reported that Casemiro sent a text to his agent that read \"tell them I'll fix it,\" when he watched United's 4-0 shellacking against Brentford last season and to his credit, he did what he promised. He was outstanding after signing Real Madrid, but his drop-off has been stark.",
      "Casemiro was poor when he returned from his hamstring injury in January and he's got a point to prove in the remaining games of the campaign. He's fighting for his future.",

      "Manchester United fan and darts wonderkid Luke Littler has taken matters into his own hands after Brentford's Neal Maupay took a cheap dig at Scott McTominay following the 1-1 draw at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday night.",
      "Maupay was involved in a tussle with McTominay late on in the second half as the Bees looked to mount a late assault on Andre Onana's goal. Both players were booked for the altercation by referee Simon Hooper, but as is usual with Maupay, the incident wasn't done there.",
      "Taking to Instagram after the match, the Frenchman wrote, \"This fan was desperate for my shirt [laughing face emoji]\" alongside an image of them coming together.",
      "The irony is that McTominay has scored more than Maupay this season, despite being a midfielder. However, Littler wasn't willing to let the former Brighton attacker get away with his jibe.",
      "Responding to a post on Sportbible that covered Maupay's tongue-in-cheek comment, Littler wrote, \"talks more than he scores [hands covering eyes emoji]\".",
      "It came after the post said, \"Neal Maupay is winding up opposing players once more after posting about Scott McTominay becoming his latest 'fan' [red and white striped shirt and laughing face emojis] The Premier League is back and so is Maupay [laughing face emoji]\".",
      "Littler won his first-ever Premier League Darts night on Thursday after beating Nathan Aspinall in a brilliant final in Belfast. The teenage sensation has managed to keep up with his love of football while continuing to rise up in the sporting world, and he was welcomed to the club earlier this year.",
      "\"To be honest, it was good to get out of the house,\" he told the Mail on Sunday in February. \"I support United so it was nice to meet my idols at my home club, it was a good day out.",
      "\"I watched them train for a bit but it was raining and I went in when they started doing tactics and all that stuff. I also met Sir Alex at United vs. Spurs a few weeks ago. That was good.",
      "\"My dad had seen their glory years, witnessed '99, and so it was good for him to meet him. It was good to chat. I didn't get much out of him, because of his accent, but he did say keep going and stick to it.\"",
      "Littler has also been taken on by Spurs attacker James Maddison, who embraces a darts throw celebration. Maupay himself was at his combative best (worst) when aiming a similar dig at the Englishman earlier this season.",

      "\"Whoever the manager has been while Fred's been there, they've always picked him. So [the critics] can continue to keep saying Fred shouldn't be a Manchester United player, but everyone keeps picking him because obviously, he's a good trainer and a good lad.",
      "\"Fred isn't the problem at Manchester United. He's one of the ones that’s been consistent in performance levels.\"",
      "That viewpoint has rather been reinforced by everything that's transpired in the United midfield this season. Selling Fred for to Fenerbahce for a mere £13million looked cheap in the summer and looks even cheaper now.",
      "His would-be replacements in the United engine room have failed to deliver. Sofyan Amrabat joined on an expensive £8.5million loan and has looked a poor fit, while Mason Mount has just struggled to stay fit.",
      "Of course, United have unearthed Kobbie Mainoo from their academy but he's hardly a like-for-like Fred replacement. He's a different profile of midfielder entirely.",
      "Then there's Fred's fellow countryman Casemiro, who looks like he may be running out of road at United after a disappointing second season.",
      "Hindsight is great but it's also futile and the decision to try and move beyond Fred seemed sound in itself.",
      "He's the wrong side of 30 and time was ticking on his contract. Yet it's not like Erik ten Hag is trying to implement more control in his midfield; games are still as chaotic as ever and United usually look short of energy in the middle of the park.",
      "Fenerbahce have seen the best of Fred this season. He's a fan favourite in Turkiye having helped the Istanbul club to victory in 22 of the 24 games he's played. The one defeat was effectively a dead rubber, the second leg of a European tie that Fenerbahce already had wrapped up.",
      "The bottom line is that United could do much worse than to unearth a player similar to Fred in this summer's transfer window. Amrabat's loan will not be extended, Mount needs more time to bed in and Casemiro's future is in doubt.",
      "Mainoo and Fred's crossover period at United was short. They only played with each other for 60 minutes, in a Carabao Cup tie against Charlton last season.",

      "Man United transfer news as attention turns to the EFL for bargain transfers and unexpected wonderkids in search of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's answer to Kylian Mbappe",
      "Of the many soundbites that Sir Jim Ratcliffe has offered up publicly since his stake in Manchester United was confirmed earlier this year, claims of seeking to acquire the next Kylian Mbappe are certainly up there with the most interesting.",
      "Having spent recklessly and largely aimlessly across the past decade without much success, the Red Devils are stepping into a brave new world. Away from even the well-documented marginal gains, United are looking to transform their football operations and the market tactics will certainly be part of that.",
      "A far cry from the long-term attempts by the Glazer family and their structure to sign readymade players, throwing them into a team with a big-name head coach, Ratcliffe promises to be different.",
      "\"What I would rather do is find the next Mbappe, rather than spend a fortune just trying to buy success,\" he told the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast last month. \"It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way?",
      "\"Anybody could figure that one out. But what's much more challenging is to to find the next Mbappe, the next [Jude] Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.\"",
      "With reports suggesting that United are now looking to land Port Vale starlet Baylee Dipepa,Manchester Evening News has taken a look at some of the other prospects that the club could turn to in order to unearth gems for the future. Given that players such as Bellingham, Jarrod Bowen, Ollie Watkins, Jamie Vardy, Harry Maguire, Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze, and Jack Grealish have all come from EFL backgrounds, it's certainly a goldmine to be attacked.",
      "The logical place to start, Dipepa has been linked with a move to Old Trafford. The Sun reports that the 17-year-old is already a player that United are keen to do business with and that they are leading the race for his signature.",
      "Dipepa made his senior breakthrough earlier this season, only turning 17 in January, and has slowly risen to become a regular in Darren Moore's squad despite their struggles in League One. That such trust has been placed in a player only making their Under-17s debut last month is a testament to the talent available.",
      "Dipepa has scored twice for Vale's senior side this season as well as getting two assists from his 21 games. He is certainly someone now being monitored at the top level.",
      "It's hard to be the next Mbappe as a centre-back, but as far as young defenders go, this guy is right up there. Already linked with a move to Chelsea amongst other sides, the 21-year-old has stacks of EFL experience for his age.",
      "Edwards has already racked up 134 appearances for Peterborough and has started every single game this term so far in League One. Posh are challenging to get back to the Championship, where Edwards has already played most of a full season, and his stock only continues to rise.",
      "As an England Under-20 international, the right-footed, right-sided centre-half, Edwards one of the best in the division. It is worth remembering at this stage that John Stones spent time coming through the EFL as a young defender, as did Joe Gomez.",
      "United have spent big to try and solve their problems at the back, including on another EFL graduate in Maguire, and Edwards at this stage of his career would represent an exciting shift for the club. His contract expires in the summer of 2025 and a bargain could be on the cards.",
      "If United fancy trying to get one back on their old rivals Leeds then this is certainly one to be on top of. Gray is hardly an unknown to the world of football at this stage but then again neither were Olise or Eze and they still left for pennies compared to some of the moves United have made.",
      "Gray is sure to attract plenty of attention in the coming years and should Leeds go up then the moment he kicks a ball in the top flight next season his price will rocket, but it's still the type of deal that Ratcliffe can look at. Gray is a Leeds academy prospect capable of playing right-back or midfield and frankly, he's the real deal.",
      "It doesn't quite have the allure of picking up a more unknown talent and taking them to the top, but it would still represent a great acquisition.",
      "This one is slightly different. Clarke was once the wizz-kid that Dipepa, Gray, and Edwards are currently being touted as, but has seen things stagnate. Now 23, the former Leeds youngster has come into his own.",
      "Since moving to Sunderland he has found a lease of life, something Amad can also attest to, and is having comfortably his best season to date. Following up an impressive nine goals and 12 assists for the Black Cats in the Championship last year, Clarke now has 15 goals and four assists this term despite the team dropping off.",
      "Given he's older than most that are deemed ready to step up to the Premier League in a move like this it represents even more of an unsuspecting deal. Tottenham only sold him in July 2022 and he has had several struggles along the way, but for what would be a small price, Clarke is showing he's ready for the step-up.",
      "Another player that has had an up and down time, Dewsbury-Hall has excelled as perhaps the Championship's MVP this year. From an untroubling, unsuspecting deeper option for Leicester in the top flight between 2021 and 2023, dropping down a level has seen him develop significantly.",
      "Dewsbury-Hall now has 11 goals and 13 assists in a Foxes side vying for promotion. Given their financial struggles he will be one of the main assets clubs look at over the summer should they go up or not.",
      "As a versatile midfield option, Dewsbury-Hall may well provide value for money despite being another older option on this list. At 25 he is not a wonderkid but a solid piece of business instead. He is the type of player it wouldn't be surprising to see play in the Premier League next year, stand out for whoever he is representing, and be linked with a quick move up the table.",

      "Jadon Sancho could be given a new lease of life at Manchester United if Sir Jim Ratcliffe appoints Jason Wilcox as director of football",
      "Erik ten Hag could be in for an awkward reunion with Jadon Sancho if Jason Wilcox joins Manchester United.",
      "The Southampton chief has recently emerged as a target for the Reds, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe eager to appoint a director of football at Old Trafford. The Manchester Evening News understands that United have approached the Saints about Wilcox.",
      "It's said that the Reds have offered the Championship club the equivalent of a full year's salary as compensation, even though the 53-year-old only arrived at St Mary's in the summer. For now, it remains to be seen whether Ratcliffe can wrap up a deal for Wilcox, but it's clear why the British billionaire has been so keen to secure his signature.",
      "The Southampton director enjoyed 10 fruitful years at Manchester City and first made a name for himself as the club's under-18s manager in 2013. Three years later, he was promoted to head of academy coaching before becoming academy director in 2017, a position he remained in until January 2023.",
      "Over the years, Wilcox has worked with some brilliant young players who have gone on to become senior internationals. One of those players was Jadon Sancho, who is set to return to United in the summer following the expiration of his loan at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "When Sancho was just 15, he scored twice inside five minutes on his youth-team debut for Manchester City; his coach at the time was Wilcox, who was full of praise for the youngster after the game.",
      "\"For a young kid playing his first Under-18s football match, I thought he was sensational,\" Wilcox said. \"I'm really looking forward to working with him because he's a talented boy who works really hard.\"",
      "With Sancho set to return to Old Trafford at the end of the season, he could be given a new lease of life despite falling out of favour under Ten Hag. Nevertheless, in an exclusive interview with the Mirror in October 2016, Wilcox explained his role at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "He said: \"Our aim is to have a first-team squad packed with players from our Academy. Not only that, it would also be great to get some ­Mancunian blood into the team.\"",
      "He added: \"It gives the boys a real lift when Pep takes in a game or watches a training session because they know he is taking an interest in them. But we also try to harden players to the realities of the game.",
      "\"We take them to play in tournaments abroad – and I tell them that I expect them to go home with the trophy. We want them to be schooled in playing against different cultures, where they might be up against Juventus in front of 6,000 people, and they are being tripped, kicked and pulled by a cynical Italian defender.",
      "\"That’s a big part of their football education. We have to make it hard so that when they do step onto the big stage of the Champions League in front of 60,000 fans, they don’t just have the tactical and technical skills to cope, but also the temperament.\"",

      "Manchester United are monitoring the progress of a promising teenager at Port Vale. Our man on the ground has given us the inside track on him.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping closed tabs on Port Vale's 17-year-old prospect Baylee Dipepa as the Red Devils look to take a more long-term approach to the type of signings they are making under the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era.",
      "The teenager may not be well-known outside the lower-league scene but he is certainly causing a stir in League One right now with the relegation-threatened Valiants.",
      "Bringing United fans up to speed with Dipepa's progress is our very own veteran Port Vale reporter Mike Baggaley, who has profiled everything you need to know about the promising youngster.",
      "Who is he?",
      "Baylee Dipepa, aged 17, has been in the Vale youth system since under-nines level. The striker, from Blythe Bridge in North Staffordshire, has broken into the first team this season, making one league start and another 15 appearances off the bench in the league, up to and including Saturday’s win over Bristol Rovers.",
      "He became the second-youngest scorer in the club’s history when he came off the bench to score at home to Shrewsbury on March 9 with a poacher’s goal from close range after finding space in the area. He followed that with a much more spectacular goal on Saturday when he controlled the ball 35 yards out, turned and beat three players before beating the keeper with a low drive from the edge of the area.",
      "That was his fourth goal in nine days having been called up for England under-17 duty the previous week and scored three in three games at St George’s Park, including two after coming off the bench for his debut against Northern Ireland. What sort of player is he?",
      "A striker. Vale manager, Darren Moore, who was appointed at the start of February, said of Dipepa last month: “Since I have arrived at the club I have looked at him and thought he has all the characteristics of a number nine. He is really young and there are lots of parts of his game that he will develop.”",
      "The youngster, who is around 6ft, showed a turn of pace in his goal against Bristol Rovers but skill, determination and footwork to keep defenders guessing were just as important in the goal. His ability to control the ball, turn and drive up the pitch was also important in helping out the defence on a couple of occasions.",
      "In fact, two Rovers players were booked for bringing him down in the hour he was on the pitch after replacing former Manchester United academy graduate James Wilson who was injured.",
      "What to make of the speculation linking him with Manchester United?",
      "Vale fans are a little sceptical about reports linking their players with moves away. In recent months, the club admitted they were baffled by reports in the national media linking one of Dipepa’s youth team mates to a number of Europe’s top clubs, speculation they said was both out of the blue and unfair on a player still trying to earn a professional contract.",
      "Linking Dipepa to Manchester United is also putting a lot of pressure on a young player still making the transition from youth to first-team football in League One.",
      "That said, it would be surprising if bigger clubs than Vale weren’t watching him because, despite only turning 17 in January, he’s already reached 20 first-team appearances including 16 in the league, and represented his country at under-17 level.",
      "In fact, when Dipepa made his England debut, he was the only player from a League One club in the matchday 18. The rest of the starting XI and bench was made up of 13 players from the Premier League, three from the Championship and one from the MLS.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest Vale fans have been raving about Dipepa for months. In fact, when he made a series of appearances off the bench in league games, there was criticism of the club and the then-director of football David Flitcroft that failing to sign a striker in the January window had meant the club were having to call on a player who has only just turned 17.",
      "But his performance against Bristol Rovers suggests he has quickly adapted to the senior game and learned plenty from his experiences so far, as well as taken plenty of confidence from his flying start to international football with England under-17s. He also comes across as level-headed and, with the support of the club and his family, determined not to let up on the hard work and dedication that has taken him this far.",
      "When he signed his first professional contract with Vale in January, a deal that runs until the summer of 2026, his mum Laura told the club: “I cried, it was emotional and it took me a good few days to get my head around it all! We are proud beyond belief of everything that he has achieved, within the last six months especially, through his hard work and dedication.”",

Impressively, Mantato scored four goals against Blackburn in a 5-2 win for the Under-18s and he was on the scoresheet again last weekend in a friendly for the Under-21s.",
      "United made an academy trip to France over the weekend to give youngsters an overseas experience and behind-closed-doors fixtures at AS Monaco and OGC Nice were arranged. The young Reds won 2-1 against Monaco and Mantato scored a late match-winner to win the friendly, with Amir Ibragimov, another highly-regarded talent, also scoring. Nice won 3-2 in their clash against United on Easter Monday and Mantato scored again in that defeat.",
      "The youngster, who has bundles of pace, has been in prolific form and it's thought his long-term future will be on the right wing due to the attacking quality he can provide. Mantato's superb goalscoring form - six in three games - has impressed clubs and he's continued to go from strength to strength after taking part in first-team training. His dribbling ability is a huge asset and he's been backed to have a bright future at Old Trafford.",
      "It's understood talks are ongoing with United and they're set to enter a crucial stage, with the club hopeful of striking an agreement to persuade the 16-year-old to commit to his future in Manchester after a string of excellent performances for the academy.",
      "A number of rivals in the Premier League remain interested in the exciting Mantato and sources have indicated United would receive a six-figure sum in compensation if he were to switch clubs given they have been responsible for his development to this stage.",
      "Mantato can play at left-back and on the wing, and his style has led to comparisons with Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, who started his career as a defender before moving forward. Mantato joined United's academy aged nine and has represented England in the youth system. He recently made his debut for the Three Lions' Under-16s team.",

His agitation, it seems, was entirely justified as, mere minutes later, his side were 2-0 down and staring down the barrel of their fifth Women's Super League (WSL) defeat of the season.",

      "In fairness, Skinner could hardly have been expected to say anything else. Saturday's 3-1 defeat in east Manchester means his team are now 15 points worse off than the league leaders - a fact that only becomes more sobering when you consider it is their city rivals who currently occupy that top spot.",

That the Reds lost again by the same scoreline at the Etihad is a damning indictment of their ability to step up to the plate when the occasion demands it the most.",
      "Maybe the biggest compliment you could pay City on Saturday afternoon, is that they didn't have to play particularly well to get their noses in front. It was United who shaded the first half-hour of the contest before Jess Park's volley gave the hosts the advantage.",
      "It must be said that any consternation in United's ranks would have been justified, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "\"I actually felt we played well in large parts of the game,\" Skinner said. \"The first goal shouldn't even exist as a goal, she's offside. The difference between smaller and big stadiums is when there are more fans momentum swings quicker. The second and third goal we've got to be better for.\"",
      "Certainly, it's hard to refute the United manager's assertion that the goal changed the game. And, just eight minutes later, Park had made it two, deftly prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box.",
      "On that occasion, Skinner and his players only had themselves to blame. That Park - who has proved herself to be one of the most capable players in the league in recent months - was afforded so much time and space in the penalty area will surely be one of the biggest talking points when the Reds begin their post-match post-mortem at Carrington on Monday morning.",
      "So too will the fact that City were able to carve United open so easily just seconds into the second half, with Park turning provider this time as Shaw finished coolly past a dejected Mary Earps.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. But, as they did against Arsenal and Chelsea, the Reds had left it too late and were left to rue yet another missed opportunity to take their stuttering season off life support.",
      "Of course, there are some mitigating factors for this underwhelming campaign. Any team in world football would struggle to seamlessly replace the considerable talents of Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo, who left the club last summer for Barcelona and Arsenal respectively. Injuries have also played their part, with summer signings Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa both having endured lengthy spells on the sidelines.",
      "But ultimately, United have just simply not been good enough. Fingers will rightly be pointed at the manager but the players must also take accountability ahead of a summer that will be crucial in shaping the club's future.",
      "Certainly, if the rest of the season is to be viewed as an audition for a long-term place in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's United regime, then Skinner and his squad must now hope for a flawless end to the campaign. \"Pressure makes you stronger,\" the Reds boss said. \"This club will rise to the levels we all want. I’m a fighter so I’m going to put myself in a position where I can make this team the best in the land. That’s my personal responsibility.\"",
      "In many ways, Skinner's defiance is admirable and speaks to a manager who has never shied away from the added pressures that come with presiding over a United team. But, no matter how valiantly he is battling to secure his future at the club, it very much feels like he is currently losing the fight.",

      "Jess Park scored a brace in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium",
      "If this is to be viewed as Jess Park's breakthrough season at Manchester City, then it was against Manchester United at the Etihad where she truly came of age.",
      "When big-money summer signing, Jill Roord, ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) back in January, it was hard not to fear that the Blues' title charge might start to veer drastically off course. But Park, who joined City as a winger in 2017, is relishing her newfound responsibility in the no. 10 role and has inspired Gareth Taylor's side to huge wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and now United.",
      "For the lifelong City fan, who grew up aiming to follow in the footsteps of Sergio Aguero, it simply doesn't get much better than this; netting a brace against your arch-rivals to send your club - at least temporarily - top of the Women's Super League (WSL) table. Boyhood City fan Phil Foden did the same for men's side against United earlier in March, winning at the Etihad by the same scoreline - and now it was Park's turn.",
      "It is worth noting that it was only a few short months ago that United took to the pitch at Old Trafford two points better off than their city rivals, hoping to maintain their unbeaten start to their league campaign and truly assert themselves in the title race.",
      "Perhaps that afternoon, which ended with the visitors celebrating in front of the East Stand, was the turning point; the moment where the gulf in quality between the two sides first became apparent and the significant chasm that now separates them in the table first began to forge.",
      "Certainly, the landscape heading into this weekend’s showdown at the Etihad was very different. This time, it was advantage City, with the Blues bidding to end the day three points clear of the indomitable Chelsea ahead of their clash with West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, meanwhile, travelled to east Manchester as the would-be disrupters. A win at the home of their noisy neighbours would not quite abate the simmering frustration sparked by what has been a largely underwhelming season, but stopping City from winning a first WSL title since 2016 would at least go some way to tempering the supporters’ angst.",
      "Indeed, even Blues boss Taylor couldn’t find a way to diminish the magnitude of the contest for his side. “Every game is so important because the margin for error is really tight,\" he said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Any kind of dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. We don't underestimate any game. But I probably have to agree (that this is) one of the biggest derbies.\"",
      "And maybe it was the high stakes that contributed to City's subpar start on Saturday afternoon, with United enjoying the best of the early chances in M11. First it was Nikita Parris who came close, drawing a fine save from Khiara Keating, before Brazil international Geyse drilled an effort just wide of the post.",
      "City, though, are always dangerous, even when they are not at their best. And it was Park who fired the first warning shot, taking aim from 25 yards out and forcing Mary Earps to smother the ball to safety.",
      "United still had their moments, most notably when Lucia Garcia's deflected effort had to be tipped over the crossbar by Keating. But City grew in stature with every passing second and took the lead in the 37th minute when Leila Ouhabi teased the ball into the path of Park, who volleyed brilliantly past Earps.",
      "There may have been some justifiable consternation in the United ranks, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "And so it proved, as - just minutes after Shaw saw her strike correctly ruled out for offside - Park had made it two, prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box. The England international was given a heroes reception as she made her way down the tunnel at half-time, while Taylor turned to give a triumphant fist pump to the crowd.",
      "But the job was not done yet and it quickly became clear City had no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half, with Shaw finding the back of the net mere seconds after the restart. The Jamaican, who finished coolly after a perfectly-weighted through ball from Park, had managed to cement herself as City's top-scorer before the VIPs in the Colin Bell stand had even had the time to finish their half-time pies and return to their padded seats.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. However, while Marc Skinner's side enjoyed the lion's share of possession in the final quarter, City's defensive fortitude won out, ensuring the hosts won the day in front of a 40,086-strong crowd.",
      "\"It's always felt like (this could be our year),\" Taylor said when quizzed on the possibility of his side winning the title this term. \"When we started the season, our first game at West Ham was very good and you start to see things the team.",
      "\"Obviously there's a long way from that point to where we are now and full credit to the players and the group behind the group to get us to this position. It's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of trust. The most important thing now... is not to worry too much about anything else and control what we need to control.\"",
      "On Park, the City boss added: \"The cherry on the cake we've been looking for with Jess has been goals and assists and she gave us that today on a big stage. Her performance was good, with and without the ball she drives really well and gives us a lot of energy and a lot of quality.",
      "\"Jess has stepped into the opportunity really well. When you think about how patient she had to be, she's done really well.\"",
      "Certainly, Park will have been delighted to have seen England manager Sarina Wiegman in the stands to take in her exceptional display. With the European Championships to come next summer, the 22-year-old is surely edging ever closer to a starting spot in the Lionesses team. But, if City can carry this momentum into the final run-in, Park and her teammates might just be celebrating a different trophy in a couple of months' time.",

      "Man United Women's boss Marc Skinner has yet to meet the Ineos chief but hopes his arrival could help propel the club to success",
      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“We’re excited about any of the plans that come. It feels like a real positive movement. Whatever the plans may be, we have to continue to align our positive energy towards that movement. That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",
      "However, they will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to the Chigwell Construction Stadium to take on 10th-place West Ham on Sunday.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a number of issues to resolve at Old Trafford for both the Men's and Women's sides, and Marc Skinner's team must not be left behind",
      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "He joined City in 2012 after spending a few years out of the game post-retirement. After taking over the U18s a year later, he led the side to a league title win and two FA Youth Cups.",
      "Wilcox then assumed the role as academy director in 2017 and oversaw the structuring of staff, development of players and instilling of a professional ethos.",
      "In the three years running up to his departure to Southampton last year, both City's U21s and U18s won three consecutive league titles under his leadership featuring the likes of Oscar Bobb, Rico Lewis and Cole Palmer, who all subsequently broke into the City first team.",

      "Tuesday 2 April 2024 21:02, UK",
      "Ivan Toney would turn Manchester United into Premier League title challengers, Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has claimed.",
      "MacAnthony has been chairman of Peterborough since 2006, including during Toney's two-year stint at the club between 2018 and 2020.",
      "Toney has recently been linked with moves to Arsenal and Chelsea and with his contract up at the end of next season, Brentford could be looking to cash in on the striker.",
      "\"Put him in an Arsenal team, put him in a Liverpool or a Man United team, he scores 30 Premier League goals in a season,\" MacAnthony told Sky Sports.",

      "\"I think there's five clubs in the world who could probably end up buying him and he will improve any of those clubs by a mile. He turns Manchester United into challengers for the Premier League.\"",
      "While MacAnthony has been at the helm, Peterborough United have become renowned for astute scouting with Toney a prime example of their success.",
      "The England striker was sold for a profit to Brentford after making 94 appearances and contributing 49 goals for the Posh.",
      "\"Having scouted players not just for their technical ability but their personality and their growth for 18 years, I think he's not even in his prime even though he's turning 28,\" said MacAnthony.",
      "\"Whoever buys him, £100m will be well spent because he's coming into his prime. You're going to get five or six years of his best.",
      "\"He's scored a goal every other game in the Premier League for Brentford. Put Ivan in an Aston Villa team under Emery and see how many goals he scores in the Premier League. He'd probably be up there for the Golden Boot.\"",
      "Toney's manager Thomas Frank spoke about his forward's future and while he hopes he will remain at the club, his contract situation puts his future in doubt.",
      "\"I would love him to stay forever, but the reality is he has one year left on his contract,\" said Frank.",
      "\"He's been pretty open about playing for a top club in the future, so there's a couple of scenarios. He leaves in the summer, he leaves in the winter, or he stays until the end.",

      "The ex-Peterborough star rewarded Southgate's faith by converting England's opener from the spot to secure his first international goal.",
      "MacAnthony was adamant Toney must be on the plane to Germany for this summer's Euros.",
      "\"Are you kidding me? He's not only one of your best attackers, he's your best defender. You're one nil up late in a game, he's the type of player you bring on who defends from the front because, just on corners alone, he's your best defender,\" he said.",

      "Tuesday 2 April 2024 19:02, UK",
      "Arsenal vs Luton - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Manchester City and Liverpool have the know-how, but Arsenal have the numbers in their favour. Having both the best attack and defence in the league means the Gunners have the best goal difference, which could be crucial come May 19.",
      "Should Arsenal keep their healthy tally over their two title rivals, then all they need at this stage is to better Liverpool and Man City's run-in by one positive result to claim the title.",
      "So while the visit of Luton may represent a game that Arsenal should win, the manner of which they pick up three points will sit in their minds, especially given Liverpool and City both have home games against Sheffield United and Aston Villa - the latter can be leaky at times with a high line.",
      "The omens look good for the Gunners too. Luton have conceded two or more goals in six out of their last eight away games in the league, while Arsenal have won five from five against the newly-promoted sides this term, scoring at least three goals in each of those games.",
      "The goal difference situation means winning ugly may not suffice anymore, it's about how you win. The tense crawling over the line in recent weeks against Brentford, Porto and Man City cannot become a regular occurrence for Arsenal.Sam Blitz",
      "Brentford vs Brighton - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "April signals a month of reckoning for a Brentford side that currently sit just five points clear of the relegation zone with only two wins in their last 18 matches.",
      "The west London side dominated against Manchester United on Saturday, striking the woodwork four times, but struggled to make their chances pay. It is a tale of Brentford's season, perennially unlucky with both injuries and results.",
      "Poor luck can only justify so much and despite the credit Thomas Frank has accrued he will need that luck to turn around in April with crucial games against Luton and Everton on the horizon.",
      "The first test comes from fellow Liverpool managerial candidate Roberto De Zerbi, whose Brighton side will expose whether Brentford's performance was the first sign of a spring rejuvenation or merely a reflection of United's struggles.Laura Howard",
      "Man City vs Aston Villa - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "Perfection is required of Manchester City now. Placed third on both points and goal difference following their scoreless draw against Arsenal on Sunday, all Pep Guardiola's side can do is deliver a faultless run-in and pray.",
      "That is easier said than done. Aston Villa presents the toughest test of the Citizens' mettle from the remaining games having come out on top at Villa Park in December. Leon Bailey made the difference on that occasion as City failed to score.",
      "The defending champions also struggled to convert chances on Sunday, and this time, Villa will be galvanised by the nearing prospect of Champions League qualification. They are also in search of an immaculate run-in of their own with Tottenham breathing down their necks in the race for fourth place.",
      "City so often find a way to turn it on when it matters, but Sunday could indicate that their late season perfection is wavering along with their title hopes.Laura Howard",
      "Liverpool vs Sheffield United - Thursday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "After Manchester City and Arsenal cancelled each other out with a 0-0 draw at the Etihad on Sunday, Liverpool have been put firmly in the Premier League title race driving seat. Guarding against unnecessary slip-ups now seems their greatest challenge.",
      "On the surface, Sheffield United seem an unthreatening foe. Having conceded 11 in their last three games, the fixture appears more of an opportunity to boost goal difference rather than a threat to Liverpool's title hopes.",
      "The league leaders must not rest on their laurels. Having conceded early to Brighton on Sunday, they have shown they are not infallible. As a clash at Old Trafford against Manchester United at the weekend awaits, Liverpool must maintain momentum to ensure there are no slip-ups along the way.",
      "The league leaders' hopes will be boosted by the imminent return of Curtis Jones, while the Blades continue to struggle with an extensive injury list.Laura Howard",
      "Chelsea vs Man Utd - Thursday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "A mid-table battle might not have been how Mason Mount anticipated his Chelsea return to play out, but he will arrive at Stamford Bridge wanting to prove his own decision right.",
      "For all of three minutes on Saturday, Mount appeared to be belatedly living up to his billing as Manchester United's hero. That was until Kristoffer Ajer corked celebrations with a deserved 99th-minute equaliser.",
      "It was another underwhelming United performance in a season which has proved equally underwhelming for the Englishman. Ruled out through injury since November, Mount returned with a cameo in the FA Cup victory over Liverpool touted to kickstart a so far limp season for Erik Ten Hag's side.",
      "While United's boost has not materialised, Mount could be finding his stride. His goal against Brentford was his first of the season and a clash with his former club, who have conceded two in each of their last five matches, presents an opportunity for more.Laura Howard",

      "Jones Knows sprinkles his betting insight and analysis across the midweek Premier League card...",
      "Luck is deserting Luton at the most important time of the season. Rob Edwards saw his squad decimated even further during the 2-1 defeat to Tottenham with three more injuries suffered, including one to key man Alfie Doughty.",
      "He said: \"We finished with every fit member of the senior playing staff, outfield players, on the pitch at the end. I think we've got probably 10 fit players at the moment.\"",
      "This is not ideal when you're about to face Arsenal. Sky Bet have them as 22/1 shots to cause what would be the upset of the season.",
      "I'm always looking for trend-enders to latch onto and Luton's remarkable scoring run surely looks under threat here against this Arsenal defence. It's now 18 Premier League games on the spin Luton have scored in since a 1-0 defeat to Manchester United in November. The Arsenal win to nil at 5/6 with Sky Bet looks a winner in waiting.",
      "It's the football betting guru derby. Owners Tony Bloom and Matthew Benham both made their fortunes beating the betting markets using ahead-of-their-time models and have now built two of the best run football empires in the world.",
      "I want to be with Benham's boys here.",
      "Brentford hit the woodwork four times, saw a goal disallowed for offside and had 31 attempts in their incredible game with Manchester United.",
      "At a club like Brentford, who are so guided by the underlying numbers behind their performances, that game against United will have felt like a 7-0 win. I'm expecting confidence levels and general morale to be bouncing. I'm convinced they're in a false position in 15th place. They are a team to follow in the coming weeks, especially at home.",
      "A repeat of the same levels of intensity and attacking threat will trouble Brighton, who have won just once away from home in their last nine matches - that coming at Sheffield United. They've scored a total of just 19 goals in their last 14 Premier League games and five of those came in that win over the Blades, who had 10 men. They are the joint-fourth lowest scorers in the Premier League for that period, only Burnley, Sheffield United and Everton have scored fewer.",
      "A home win at 7/5 with Sky Bet looks the best bet of the midweek card.",
      "Is it the beginning of the end of Manchester City's period of dominance of English football?",
      "They are now very much second favourites in the Premier League title race at 15/8 behind Liverpool, who thrust themselves into favouritism on Sunday with a win over Brighton. They are the 5/4 jollies now.",
      "City have only scored nine goals in their last seven Premier League games, an average which drops way below the 2.47 goals per game average they racked up across the league last season.",
      "But I'm not overly worried.",
      "The key performance metrics are holding up well when analysing them against the \"normal\" figures we'd expect from a Man City side managed by Pep Guardiola. The overall expected goals figure have City posting a return of 14.44 goals during that period, pointing to an under-performance and perhaps a period of variance going against them. This looks the worst possible time for Villa to be heading there as Guardiola's teams notoriously respond in kind when suffering a negative result like they did against Arsenal.",
      "How do we back City then at a reasonable price? We head for the half-time/full-time market, where Man City/Man City gets us to 4/5 with Sky Bet. In the 75 matches immediately after a game under Guardiola where City have lost, drew with a 'non-big six side' or drawn 0-0, they have scored 70 first half goals. A reaction is expected.",
      "I'm a little confused at why Mohamed Salah is 2/5 with Sky Bet to score anytime and Luis Diaz is 11/8.",
      "I'd have them around the same price on current form but obviously the bookmaker algorithms have spat out the rather chunky price on Diaz.",
      "In a turgid betting heat where a one-sided game looks on the cards, the Diaz anytime price looks one to focus on.",
      "The Colombian has netted seven times in his last 12 starts. In that timeframe he's had, wait for it, 50 shots to an average of 4.1 per 90 minutes with 19 of those hitting the target.",
      "The market is expecting Liverpool to score at least three goals here so it doesn't really add up that Diaz is given a 42 per cent implied probability of scoring at least one of them - my figures have it closer to 55 per cent. It looks a cracking price.",
      "Two very untrustworthy teams.",
      "The performance from Manchester United at Brentford was one which will be hard to forget for everyone associated with the club. They played with the usual mis-shapen structure without the ball as per but they added a lack of work ethic to their output. I'm not sure there's any way back for Erik ten Hag now - even the players played like it for large parts of that game.",
      "The new hierarchy at United are very analytically aware and are recruiting people into positions of authority, like Dan Ashworth, who will want to make big decisions based on data analysis. And I think that leaves Ten Hag very vulnerable over the summer based on their woeful underlying metrics.",
      "Chelsea should win this one. But attacking their corner count is a safer way of getting them in the book.",
      "Brentford's corner line was set at six or more on Saturday vs United - they hammered it, winning 14, which would have been bordering on a 100/1 shot. United's nine-game average of corners conceded now stands at 8.6 per 90 minutes after that Brentford landslide.",
      "I think the Chelsea total corners line is a play with seven or more available at 11/10 with Sky Bet. But we can be greedy. I wouldn't put people off the bigger lines too with 10 or more ripe for a bet at 11/2.",

      "His former club were dominated by relegation-threatened Brentford for the majority of the contest and even when Mason Mount looked to have delivered a smash-and-grab win with an injury-time goal, United blew their chance of an unlikely victory by conceding in the 99th minute.",
      "The result and performance suggests they will have a huge task on their hands to overhaul Tottenham or Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification. They are currently eight points off fifth-placed Tottenham and 11 behind fourth-placed Villa, who have played a game more.",
      "\"I watched Man Utd at Brentford and like everyone else, I couldn't believe what I was watching,\" he said on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought they would put a bit of pressure on Tottenham and Aston Villa on the run-in.",
      "\"It's actually really difficult to play that badly. Usually, whatever team you play against, even if you are a top team, the other team will have five or 10 minutes of play or a period of domination.",
      "\"I can't remember any point in the game where Man Utd did anything well at all.",
      "\"It was a horrible performance.\"",
      "On the race for a Champions League spot, he added: \"[Aston Villa and Tottenham] will drop points but if you look at United's level of performance, you just think that not only will they struggle to get into that fifth or fourth spot, they don't deserve to at this moment in time with what we are seeing.\"",
      "Most concerning for Neville was the drop-off from United after the feelgood factor of their dramatic FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool at Old Trafford before the international break. There was no sign of the intensity that uplifting result may have given them in their performance in west London.",
      "Inconsistency has been a major issue for United throughout the season and Neville highlighted the team's approach out of possession as a big factor.",
      "\"I can't explain that performance. I have no idea where it comes from,\" said Neville. \"It's very worrying that you can go to that level of low.",
      "\"You know you can play badly in football, you know you can have players missing, you know you can miss chances and you know sometimes you don't feel quite right, but that was a dismal, dismal effort in an attempt to play football, in an attempt to work as hard as you possibly can.",
      "\"When Man Utd give the ball away their reaction to giving the ball away is non-existent compared to all the other teams I see. They really are one of the worst teams you can see out of possession in terms of making it difficult for the other team.",
      "\"What we saw from Arsenal at Man City, and you see the levels of defending, compactness and the work ethic of all the front players to be a cohesive unit and defend together, there's none of that at United.",
      "\"I'm not saying the defenders or the midfield players are blameless because they can do a lot better themselves as well, but there's not a unity at all. There's no idea of how to defend and how to play without the ball.",
      "\"It just wasn't very good and there are worrying signs that you can get to that level of low in their performance.",
      "\"You think about where Man Utd were at before the international break, they had one of the most incredible moments [against Liverpool]. They should've been absolutely bouncing into that game at Brentford and yet, we saw what we saw.\"",
      "Man Utd have a tough week ahead, with a trip to Chelsea on Thursday followed by a home Premier League game with Liverpool on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.",
      "However, Neville expects a better effort from United in that reunion with Liverpool.",
      "\"You think about next week and they won't be that bad next week against Liverpool. They can't be that bad,\" he said.",
      "\"But in the game in the FA Cup, Liverpool should have gone and won the game. In the second half they dominated the game.",
      "\"If Liverpool do their jobs next week then Manchester United will be in a lot of trouble.",
      "\"But it will be different. There will be something there, a different feeling and a different spirit.\"",

      "Jamie Redknapp criticised Man Utd's lack of \"desire\" and Erik ten Hag said Brentford \"wanted it more\" after 1-1 draw in Premier League; Bees hit the woodwork four times before Kristoffer Ajer cancelled out Mason Mount's strike in injury time",
      "Sunday 31 March 2024 14:02, UK",
      "Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp gave Man Utd's performance in the dramatic 1-1 draw at Brentford a scathing assessment and questioned the desire of Erik ten Hag's players.",
      "United looked like they had pulled off a stunning smash-and-grab when Mason Mount scored his first goal for the club six minutes into stoppage time. But Kristoffer Ajer deservedly hit back in the 99th minute to make sure the Bees took something from a game they had dominated.",
      "In all, Brentford had 31 shots, their most ever in a Premier League game. They were only two touches in the Man Utd box away from equalling a Premier League record (Man City's 87). And they hit the woodwork four times.",
      "It was a superb performance from Brentford - who were as good as Man Utd were bad.",
      "After United beat Liverpool in the FA Cup before the international break, this was a big drop off when many expected that Old Trafford victory to be a launchpad for the run-in.",
      "\"Before the game, Thomas Frank would have been a bit nervous thinking, 'We are now going to see a different United. We're going to see a United full of confidence after the result against Liverpool'. It was anything but that,\" said Redknapp.",
      "\"They gave up so much possession, there was a lack of energy with the ball, without the ball. They made Brentford look like Real Madrid!",
      "\"The way Man Utd were was so off it, the lack of desire to go into individual battles, letting them play... It was too easy for Brentford. It was like United at times only had nine men on the pitch.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Ten Hag said he felt Brentford's players \"wanted it more\".",
      "\"Maybe we didn't deserve it [the point],\" he said. \"I thought Brentford wanted more in the whole course of the game.",
      "\"In the final third, we were not secure. We were slow. Second balls, defending, we were not good. They were more aggressive. They had more energy and it should be the other way around.\"",
      "Redknapp said that was a poor reflection on the players and Ten Hag.",
      "With speculation about the Dutchman's future rumbling, this was a worrying performance, said the Sky Sports pundit.",
      "\"Ten Hag said they wanted it more. Whenever you hear a manager say that, that's quite damning,\" said Redknapp.",
      "\"He says 'Our way of playing'. I don't know what their way of playing is.",
      "\"I don't know if they play out from the back. They try to do it sometimes and pass it to the keeper and he just lumps it up the pitch. I know they haven't had the back four they'd like [because of injuries] but I don't know what the Man Utd way of playing is.",
      "\"They had so many opportunities today, Brentford. They were better in every single department.",
      "\"There's lots of talk about the [United] manager, will he still be here next year? I think the way the players are playing right now and that kind of performance, they're going to decide.",
      "\"They're the sort of performances that get the manager the sack. There was a lack of effort. If they really like this manager and want to play for him they will do that.",
      "\"I saw so many players strolling around and not looking like they care. They're playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.\"",
      "Redknapp felt United forward Marcus Rashford epitomised that attitude, saying at half-time he looked like he was \"walking around like it's a bit of fun out there\".",
      "\"Rashford is a player with so much talent,\" said Redknapp at full-time. \"He's got everything - he's got an incredible physique, he can run, he can dribble, he can shoot, he got 30 goals last year... I look at the player right now and he looks like he's not enjoying his football.",
      "\"For me it's quite heart-breaking because they've got so much talent. I want to see more.\"",
      "The result leaves United eight points off fifth-placed Tottenham and 11 off fourth-placed Aston Villa, who have played a game more. With just nine matches left for United, their prospects of grabbing a Champions League qualifying spot seem slim.",
      "\"It's so difficult to predict Man Utd because they're so inconsistent,\" said Redknapp. \"You just don't know what you're going to get.",
      "\"So for you to say they can finish above Tottenham and Aston Villa right now, you can't really make a case for them.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag: \"If you are winning you shouldn't give it away. We are a strong side and strong in certain situations and we have to get it over the line. That bit is disappointing.",
      "\"We made certain mistakes. We should act differently in a different occasion. The equaliser was absolutely unnecessary. Maybe we didn't deserve it, I thought Brentford wanted more in the whole course of the game.",
      "\"In the final third, we were not secure. We were slow. Second balls, defending, we were not good. They were more aggressive. They had more energy and it should be the other way around.",
      "\"We have many senior players, we should all stand up and take responsibility for this.",
      "\"We will keep fighting, it could be a good point in the end.\"",
      "Manchester United have another date in west London as they go to Chelsea on Thursday evening, kick-off at 8.15pm. Attention then turns to a heavyweight clash with Liverpool at Old Trafford next Sunday, with kick-off at 3.30pm.",

      "Mason Mount thought he had won it for United in the 96th minute with his first goal for the club against the run of play but Brentford finally scored three minutes later with their 31st shot of the game through Ajer. United were woeful until the final moments.",
      "Brentford will wonder how they did not take any of their myriad of chances before United scored. They struck the frame of the goal four times and were denied by a fine Andre Onana double save. That was just the tip of the iceberg.",
      "Wins for Aston Villa and Tottenham mean United are eight points adrift of fifth after being played off the park by a side just five points above the relegation zone and without a win in their last seven. Brentford somehow, after 31 shots, did not win.",

      "On United's last visit to Brentford they were 4-0 down at half-time and could have easily found themselves in a similar scenario this time around. The fight that earned them a seismic win over Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals was nowhere to be seen.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo produced two sublime moments early on but even he was chasing Brentford as they dominated the opening period. Ivan Toney saw an effort rebound off the inside of a post after Yoane Wissa nutmegged Raphael Varane with his through ball.",
      "The whole stadium thought he had scored but were left frustrated - an emotion that would persist for Brentford. Mathias Jorgensen headed onto the bar from a corner with Man Utd suspect at set pieces. Toney and Wissa also missed chances with their heads.",
      "Man Utd had to cling on for most of the second part of the half and were indebted to the last-ditch defending of Victor Lindelof, with Onana also saving a header from Keane-Lewis Potter. Sloppy passing in the final third left United looking blunt.",
      "\"They have been so bad [in the first half],\" said Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp. \"I cannot believe the lack of effort, spark, desire to win individual battles, to make things happen in that team. I'm watching Marcus Rashford walking around like it's a bit of fun out there.\"",
      "For all of Brentford's pressure, they only had one shot on target at the break. Ten Hag turned to Harry Maguire at half-time, bringing him on for Varane. The change did little to stem the tide of Brentford attacks.",
      "A rare moment of magic from Bruno Fernandes unlocked Brentford against the run of play as he slipped Rasmus Hojlund through on goal. The striker looked certain to score but was kept out by Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken at full stretch.",
      "The longer the game went on it felt inevitable that United would have a moment, but it was not forthcoming. Onana produced two stops in quick succession to keep out Yehor Yarmoliuk and Lewis-Potter with Brentford banging on the door.",
      "Wissa grazed the post with a powerful volley after Lindelof's poor clearance before Toney fired over after a moment of brilliance. It was his shot that ensured United have faced 20 shots in a league game for the 11th time this season.",
      "Substitute Antony came close with a curling effort, creating a sense of anxiety for the hosts. That was quickly dispelled when Toney put the ball in the back of the net a minute later. VAR came to United's rescue, though, with the striker marginally offside.",
      "Brentford's luck seemed to be out when they hit the frame of the goal for a fourth time through substitute Bryan Mbuemo. Errors from Onana and the returning Lisandro Martinez went unpunished and the game seemed destined to end goalless.",
      "Nine minutes were added on although that was extended due to a bang of heads between Diogo Dalot and Neal Muapay which set up this frantic finale.",
      "United, finally, deep in stoppage-time found some rhythm and scored what everyone thought was the winner in the 96th minute with Mount picking up a loose ball before burying it past Flekken. It felt like a goal that could launch his United career.",

      "Reports had linked England boss Gareth Southgate with the manager's job at Man Utd; Erik ten Hag claims he is not interested in those stories; Man Utd travel to Brentford on SNF, live on Sky Sports; kick-off 8pm",
      "Saturday 30 March 2024 21:08, UK",
      "Manchester United head coach Erik Ten Hag has dismissed reports linking England manager Gareth Southgate with his job at Old Trafford, claiming he \"does not care\" about speculation regarding his future at the club.",
      "United are understood not to have made a definitive decision over Ten Hag's future and are planning for next season with him, including potential recruitments and summer tour plans.",
      "But United's ambitious new co-owners Ineos are believed to admire Southgate, who has a good relationship with Sir Dave Brailsford as well as potential incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth.",
      "Ten Hag, however, says he is used to speculation about his job, claiming it is part and parcel of managing a big club.",
      "\"You know when you are working at Manchester United, there will always be noise and rumours around the club, team, manager, players, there will always be issues,\" he said in his press conference ahead of United's Premier League trip to struggling Brentford, live on Sky Sports on Saturday Night Football.",
      "\"You [the media] like it to talk about [speculation], but of course we have different interests, but we are not focusing on that. We are focusing on the process to make the team play better, to improve the way of playing.",
      "\"So yes, I do not care about it.",
      "\"I was trainer at Ajax and it [the pressure] was similar and so when you are working at the top in football, you get used to it - so we do not care, players do not care, I do not care.",
      "\"We are working and co-operating, we know we have to perform and we have to get the right results.\"",
      "Ten Hag, meanwhile, is confident Kobbie Mainoo can deal with the hype following his impressive full England debut.",
      "Just four months on from making his first Premier League start, the 18-year-old put in a man-of-the-match performance in Tuesday's 2-2 draw against Belgium at Wembley.",
      "Mainoo had not even been included in the initial England squad but followed a promising debut off the bench against Brazil by potentially earning a spot at Euro 2024 with his display against Belgium.",
      "That performance has taken the midfielder's stock to new heights but Ten Hag is confident the success will not go to his head.",
      "\"I thought it was very good, but we are not surprised,\" the United boss said. \"We have seen what he is capable of, that he can very quickly adapt to high levels. It looks very natural.",
      "\"We are very happy for him and of course a little bit proud. I would say very proud.",
      "\"It's great for the academy of Manchester United that they bring up a player so young going into the national team. That is a big compliment for the whole club.",
      "\"I think definitely in the first place for himself because he did it.",
      "\"But also for all the ones who worked with him during his time in the academy, so it's very good news for Manchester United.\"",
      "Asked if he has to manage the hype around Mainoo, Ten Hag said: \"Yes, but we have discussed this before and so far he handles it very well.",
      "\"If he crosses the line, yeah, of course I as a manager, we as coaches, will interfere.",
      "\"But so far it's not necessary because he enjoys football, he wants to win, he wants to give his best every day because he want to improve.",
      "\"As I say, he just wants to have fun on the pitch. For him, it's fun to play dominant, to dictate the game and to win the game.\"",
      "Mainoo was conspicuous by his absence from United's training photos on Thursday as Ten Hag's side gear up for the Saturday evening trip to Brentford.",
      "The Red Devils head to the capital looking to kick on after the jaw-dropping 4-3 extra-time win against Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final before the international break.",
      "That win gives United a pep in their step, as does the impending return of centre-back Lisandro Martinez after two months out with a knee injury.",
      "\"Yes, there is a chance [Martinez is involved on Saturday],\" Ten Hag said.",
      "\"We missed him every game because he brings a composure in the team, a calmness in the team.",
      "\"And at the same time, a winning attitude and he can express this very clearly, he can transfer this into the team and that contributes a lot to our levels.\"",
      "Questions remain over the fitness of Harry Maguire, Casemiro and Jonny Evans, among others, while Amad Diallo joins United's long-term absentees on the sidelines for the weekend.",
      "Luke Shaw is among those and faces a race against time to make England's Euro 2024 squad, but Ten Hag expects him back in a United shirt before the end of the campaign.",
      "\"Yes, I expect him back before the end of the season,\" Ten Hag said. \"That is the plan and he's still on schedule on this. He will return to our team.\"",

      "The Radar column explains why there is no panic at Brentford despite their precarious league position and asks what Man Utd could learn from their methods; watch Brentford vs Man Utd live on Sky Sports Premier League from 7.45pm on Saturday; kick-off 8pm",
      "Saturday 30 March 2024 22:12, UK",
      "Lars Friis had just taken a job on Brentford's coaching staff in January 2018 when he was invited to watch an FA Cup third-round clash against Notts County alongside co-directors of football Phil Giles and Rasmus Ankersen at the club's old Griffin Park home.",
      "The tie ended in a 1-0 loss for the hosts, despite there being 40 league places, and two divisions, between the two teams. But, more than the result, which irked the locals, it was the reaction of the two men sitting next to him that stuck in the memory of Friis.",
      "\"I thought I would see a couple of directors of football going bananas,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"But they were totally cool and calm. I was a little bit in shock because normally, losing a game like that against a lower team, you would expect anger or disappointment.\"",
      "Friis expressed his surprise to Giles afterwards. \"Phil just shrugged and said that, playing the way they did and creating the chances they did, they win that game 99 times out of 100. You can do everything right, but sometimes it just comes down to pure luck.\"",
      "Nearly five years later, having left Brentford to pursue challenges elsewhere, Friis saw the same reaction in reverse when invited back by Giles to watch another game, this time a 2-0 win over Premier League rivals West Ham at the London Stadium in December 2022.",
      "\"Again, I sat next to Phil, and again, he was exactly the same.",
      "\"Brentford scored the first goal: no reaction, no cheering, no nothing. They scored the second goal: no reaction, no cheering, no nothing. Win or lose, it's the same. Just cool and calm.",
      "\"I like it because it transmits calmness from the top down. And that is what Brentford are. They always see the facts and stats behind the feeling and emotion of the game.\"",
      "Friis's anecdote came to mind when listening to Giles, Brentford's sole director of football since Ankersen's departure in 2021, outline the importance of data to his role during a panel discussion on the subject at last week's Opta Forum in London.",
      "\"We try to ignore the results and the league table as much as possible,\" he said. Instead, Giles explained, they are guided by the underlying numbers behind their performances.",
      "This data-driven approach has of course been key to Brentford's remarkable rise from League One to the Premier League under owner Matthew Benham. It also helps to explain why there is no hint of panic about their current predicament under Thomas Frank.",
      "Brentford sit only five points above the Premier League drop zone in 15th place having lost five of their last six games and not won since early February. Defeat at home to Manchester United, live on Sky Sports on Saturday, could push them closer to danger.",
      "On the surface, the outlook does not look particularly bright. But the data tells a different story. Although results have dipped this season, Brentford, for the third year in a row, actually sit among the Premier League's top 10 teams in terms of expected goal difference.",
      "The metric, calculated by subtracting a team's expected goals against from their expected goals for, is seen as a key performance indicator. For Brentford, it offers evidence that, overall, they have not been playing nearly as badly as their league position suggests.",
      "Why, then, do they find themselves where they are, some 17 points worse off than at the same stage of the last campaign? This is where the importance of context, another factor highlighted by Giles during his appearance at the Opta Forum, comes into the equation.",
      "Most notable is that they had to navigate the first four months of the campaign without Ivan Toney as he served his betting ban.",
      "The striker, Brentford's highest scorer since their ascent to the Premier League, was crucial in helping them overperform their expected goal total in the previous two years.",
      "But without him for so much of this season, and with injuries to fellow forwards Kevin Schade and Bryan Mbeumo too, Brentford have gone from overperforming to underperforming their expected goals, scoring roughly six goals fewer than they should have, based on the quality of chances they have created.",
      "It is hardly surprising that finishing has been an issue in the context of those absences and, on top of that, there is the small matter of a defensive injury crisis at the other end, with key figures Ben Mee, Ethan Pinnock, Rico Henry and Aaron Hickey among those sidelined.",
      "It is a credit to Frank that Brentford's underlying numbers have held up despite all those challenges. The processes are still working. There is reason to believe the long-term prospects of the team remain bright, even if results do not show it right now.",
      "All of which brings us to Manchester United, a club for whom the opposite appears to be true. Erik ten Hag's side recorded a thrilling FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool before the international break, their eighth victory in their last 10 games in all competitions.",
      "For the most part, though, there has been a sense of wins being achieved in spite of performances rather than because of them.",
      "Remarkably, United have a negative expected goal difference this season, their total putting them between Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest among Premier League clubs and underlining the gap between their performance levels and those of the top three in Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City.",
      "So, what next? The latest reports coming out of Old Trafford suggest Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the club's new part-owner, is planning for Ten Hag to continue in his post next season, even as he implements an exhaustive overhaul of their behind-the-scenes set-up.",
      "But, given the success of their approach, he might wonder what his Brentford counterparts would do in the same position. Ten Hag is riding high after that topsy-turvy win over Liverpool. Strip out the emotion, though, and how much evidence of progress is there?",
      "Ten Hag, like Frank, has of course had to contend with injuries this season. Their absentee list is lengthy. But the underlying data providing comfort to Giles and Brentford in similar circumstances should be a source of concern to Manchester United.",
