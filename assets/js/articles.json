      "Ruben Amorim's desire for proven players in the transfer market already appears to be paying off. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo made a key difference as Manchester United beat Brighton at home for the first time since 2022.",
      "Cunha marked the occasion with his first goal for the club, while Mbeumo scored his fifth goal of the campaign as the Red Devils recorded a third victory on the bounce. It will not surprise many that they have such ability after they scored 35 goals combined in the Premier League last season while at Wolves and Brentford, respectively.",
      "United spent big money on the pair, splashing £200million to transform their forward options by bringing them to Old Trafford alongside Benjamin Sesko. The early indications are that it may just pay off.",

      "Manchester United forward Matheus Cunha was told to 'enjoy it' after scoring his first goal for the Red Devils on the way to victory over Brighton in the Premier League. The Brazilian forward had been anxious to get on the scoresheet ahead of the game and found it difficult to find words after achieving a dream.",
      "United signed Cunha from Wolves this summer as they spent £200million to replenish their frontline in the transfer market, also adding Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo. Cunha's team-mates were already off the mark this season, and the 26-year-old was eager to join them.",
      "Ruben Amorim's attacking star opened the scoring at Old Trafford as his side held off a late Seagulls comeback to secure a 4-2 win at home. It marked the side's third win in a row after beating Liverpool and Sunderland in their previous two games.",
      "It appears Cunha is already forming a bond with his attacking colleagues, who took plenty of joy in him finding the net. It is something the forward is very happy to be part of.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo Jr is certainly on course to follow in his father's footsteps. The 15-year-old has been called up to the Portugal U16 squad as he continues his rise through the international youth ranks, much like his father did.",
      "Despite representing several of Portugal's youth ranks before making his senior debut in 2003, Ronaldo never played for the U16 side. His son now has the honour of doing so in the upcoming Football Federations Cup.",
      "The teenager, who plays in the academy of Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, was one of 22 players called up for the tournament, which is scheduled to take place in Antalya, Turkey, between October 30 and November 4.",
      "Cristiano Jr is still very much in the infancy of what could be a blossoming football career, but he can count on his father not putting undue pressure on him. The 40-year-old previously told former Manchester United colleague Rio Ferdinand: \"Right in this moment, Cristiano wants to be a football player but I don't make big pressure, I make a little. He has pressure already to be the son of Cristiano [senior].\"",
      "Aspects of the relationship between the father and son have been played out in front of the world, including sporting punishments the young Ronaldo has had to endure and the occasion when the silent treatment existed between the pair.",
      "Ronaldo has long showcased the gym workouts and football practice he'd do with his eldest son, and the Al-Nassr superstar does not let up, even when it comes to his own offspring.",
      "A master from the penalty spot, Ronaldo has looked to improve his son's skills from 12 yards and in a social media post from nine years ago, he told a then 5-year-old Ronaldo Jr: \"If you don't score, you have to do 10 push-ups,\" before giving his son three tries to score a penalty.",
      "After missing on his first attempt, he got closer when hitting the post on his second try and succeeded with his last spot-kick, which he buried. Despite scoring, Ronaldo still instructed his son to carry out the push-up punishment with Ronaldo Jr saying: \"But I scored,\" before being told: \"Do them [the push-ups] anyway. Come on, only 10.\"",
      "Among his many remarkable attributes that has seen Ronaldo enter the club of a select few players regarded among the greatest players in football history, his competitiveness is certainly up there.",
      "It was during a conversation with former team-mate and Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand on his UR Cristiano YouTube channel, that he revealed it's a characteristic that has been passed down to Cristiano Jr.",
      "Ronaldo admitted that his son shares his disdain of losing, as he detailed: \"I was in the Red Sea a couple of days ago, and I played paddle every day, me and Cristiano Jr., and we got mad,\" the 40-year-old said.",
      "He added: \"He won't speak with me for like, two days. This is why I'm happy. Even the small one, Mateo, they are at peace (when they are angry), but I like this, it shows they have personality.\"",
      "Cristiano Jr was born a year after his father left Manchester United for Real Madrid, but was able to witness the love the Red Devils fanbase retained for the Portuguese icon upon his return to Old Trafford in 2021.",
      "In what was a fairytale second debut season for Ronaldo, who scored 24 goals in 38 games, his second and final campaign was a disastrous one amid his breakdown in a relationship with then-manager Erik Ten Hag.",
      "Before his contract was terminated in November 2022, Ronaldo was banned from taking part in a match against Chelsea after his tantrum against Tottenham Hotspur. The striker refused to come on as a substitute in the final minutes against Spurs, before storming down the tunnel and out of the stadium before the full-time whistle.",
      "It was during his bombshell interview with Piers Morgan on Talk TV that Ronaldo opened up about how Cristiano Jr reacted upon learning the situation to suspend his father, admitting it left him feeling \"humiliated\".",
      "He told Morgan: \"I remember arriving home and Cristiano see me and say, ‘Daddy do you not go to the game?’ I say, ‘No, because the club punish me with three days’. And then he said, ‘How are they going to punish you if you are the best player in the world and you're not gonna play?’ I said, ‘No I'm not gonna play because I have not been behave’. And he look at me like, ‘My Daddy not behave, what?\"",

The all-time top scorer in football history, who now has 950 goals for club and country, remains determined to reach the 1,000-goal milestone and add to his 34 major trophies.",

He was hailed as one of BVB's marquee signings when he joined in a £25million deal in July.",

Making matters worse are the growing tensions off the pitch between Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl and Bellingham's father, Mark.",

The decision infuriated Mark, who waited in the tunnel after the final whistle to confront members of the club's hierarchy.",

He provides expert coverage on Manchester United and Manchester City, the Premier League as a whole, and the England football team. Jeremy has covered football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as Wimbledon, the golf majors and the Olympics.",
      "Bruno Fernandes put his dreams before dosh when deciding to turn down offers from Saudi Arabia. And it's safe to assume those aspirations stretch past winning three league games on the spin for Manchester United, or being in the top half of the table.",
      "Or having to spend months on end without European football of some description. Let alone the Champions League variety. So a place in the sun, lining up alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, will have been appealing.",
      "But all of the above is what Fernandes chose ahead of some serious Saudi dollars in the summer. And no-one should be more grateful to him for doing so than Ruben Amorim.",
      "Fernandes could have been forgiven for looking around him at the wreckage last season left behind at Old Trafford, and deciding he'd had enough. In recent times, Fernandes has run his blood to water on behalf of United. And got no reward for it whatsoever.",
      "The 31-year-old has given his prime years to United, scoring 100 goals and contributing 84 assists. He's been voted 'Player of the Year' four times out of five.",
      "And believe it or not, things could have been much worse for Amorim, had Fernandes not been around. United might have struggled to raise a pulse under Amorim, but Fernandes has still been the heartbeat of the team.",
      "And it took the Portuguese less than two minutes to remind people of the fact at Old Trafford on Saturday night. When he ghosted into space and met a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, but sent his header wide.",
      "Moments later he was free again and set to pounce, had Matheus Cunha crossed to him, instead of attempting to score from an impossible angle. Fernandes was running the show again. Directing the traffic. Putting colleagues like Amad Diallo and Mbeumo into threatening positions with intelligent passes.",
      "And on his 300th appearance for United, looking determined to celebrate the landmark occasion in style.",
      "Chirping in the ear of referee Anthony Taylor, and those of his team-mates. Not least when Taylor decided to miss the most blatant penalty possible, when Maxim De Cuyper tripped Amad inside the box.",
      "Forget Fernandes being too good to grace the Saudi Pro-League, because at times he looks too good to be stuck in this United side.",
      "When United were considering signing Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon back in 2019, the club's head of recruitment showed a video in a meeting of the midfielder kicking down the dressing room door back in Lisbon, having been sent off in a game against Boavista.",
      "CEO at the time, Ed Woodward, 'loved' the passion of the incident. He thought it was what United needed, and was proved right because Fernandes was one of the best signings he ever made during his time running the club. That passion was on show when he ran over to Cunha to smack his chest in celebration at the Brazilian's opening goal.",
      "Representing United still means a lot to him. Something which can't be said of others to have pulled on the famous red shirt in recent times. But there is no escaping the fact Fernandes remains in danger of being unfulfilled at Old Trafford.",
      "He's spent almost six years there, and has just two domestic cups to his name. He's never had a sniff of winning a Premier League title, or the Champions League. Which is nowhere near good enough for someone of his abilities.",
      "And it's difficult to see this changing.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Fernandes insists he won't discuss a new deal at United until after next summer's World Cup. But United bosses shouldn't give him a choice in the matter.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who watched this win over Brighton, shouldn't be waiting that long.",
      "Just give Fernandes what he wants. He deserves that much.",
      "Because the Saudis won't go away, while United's slim chances of winning something big will be reduced to zero, without Fernandes pushing the buttons.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' release clause could scupper the Portugal star's dreams of playing in Brazil. At the very least, any club from the South American country looking to meet the asking price would need to more than double their transfer record.",
      "Fernandes opted to stay at Old Trafford despite summer interest from Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal, but he will reportedly be allowed to leave for a team outside the Premier League if they are prepared to pay a little under £57million. The current record for Brazil's Serie A is the £22.3m Palmeiras paid Barcelona for Vitor Roque earlier this year.",
      "The Portugal international indicated to journalists this week that he is happy at Old Trafford for now, while hinting he could assess his options once more after the 2026 World Cup. \"I had the conversations with Al-Hilal. Everyone is aware of that. Everyone knows that. There were also other clubs that tried after Al-Hilal, but obviously my answer wouldn't change,\" he said.",
      "He also pointed to Ruben Amorim's desire for him to stay, adding: \"I always said that if the club was like 'Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project', or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "It was back in May that Fernandes spoke about a desire to potentially play in Brazil. \"Whenever I can, I follow it, because I find Brazilian football attractive, electric football, with a lot of quality, joy, very one-on-one,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s pure football. And I think that now, with the coaches that are there, not only the Portuguese, but also Brazilians, are increasingly developing in the tactical part. I don’t really like talking about the distant future, but it’s like I said. It’s attractive football, very interesting.",
      "\"The only thing is that the trips are very long there in Brazil! There are many competitions, many clubs that play Libertadores and Sudamericana, very good competitions. I’m not saying no, because Brazilian football is very attractive, and we never know the future.\"",
      "Even if a team meets Fernandes' clause next summer, there's no guarantee it will lead to a move. He has continued to play a big part under Amorim, albeit often in a deeper role than the one he often occupied last season.",
      "Much can change between now and May, with United chasing a return to European football after last season's lowly finish. They entered this weekend just two points off the Champions League places, but a congested top half means there's still plenty to play for.",

      "Now the veteran ex-Bayern Munich hitman is expected to leave the Spanish giants on a free transfer next summer.",
      "His departure would spark a mad scramble for his signature. United boss Ruben Amorim is a long-time admirer of the veteran striker. And he reckons luring Lewandowski to Old Trafford would have a positive impact on his side and help some of his other players develop.",
      "But Ratcliffe had made it clear United will not repeat mistakes of the past, when it comes to indulging in signing players coming towards the end of their careers.",
      "United have done this with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane, Edinson Cavani and Bastian Schweinsteiger. But all of them proved to be big mistakes, costing United tens of millions in the transfer market and almost as much again in wages.",
      "Despite being 37, Lewandowski is earning a staggering £540,000-a-week at Barca. And the expectation is that, amid their much-publicised financial issues, which has seen the Blaugrana leveraged to the hilt, he will be allowed to depart for a new challenge next summer.",

      "Manchester United's new-look attack clicked into gear to blitz their Brighton hoodoo as Ruben Amorim's men survived a late scare to triumph 4-2 over the Seagulls.",
      "Fresh off a memorable win over Liverpool last week it was the hosts who broke the deadlock in style mid-way through the first half courtesy of Matheus Cunha, who notched his first United goal with a perfectly measured finish from the edge of the box after being teed up by Casemiro.",
      "The Red Devils didn't have to wait too long for a second as Casemiro got in on the act, albeit his strike ended up past Bart Verbruggen via a significant deflection off the unfortunate Yasin Ayari.",
      "United continued to threaten after the break and the excellent Bryan Mbeumo seemed to have killed the game off as a contest after being slipped in by Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Brighton have become a bit of a bogey team for Manchester United in recent years. But Ruben Amorim's men banished that hoodoo in some style at Old Trafford before Brighton's late flurry.",
      "The visitors made a bright start and got their just rewards when Cunha arrowed his maiden Red Devils goal beyond Verbruggen. And though Brighton rallied late, that shouldn't take the gloss off of another big result for United and Amorim, who finally won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time last weekend.",
      "Much has been made of Manchester United's transfer activity in recent years amid claims they've overpaid on some deals, so the decision to drop £200million-plus on a new attack this summer was always likely to be scrutinised pending results.",
      "Thankfully for the Red Devils, their decision to spend big-money on Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo looks better by the week. Mbeumo has been electric and showed flashes of brilliance again here before his two goals. Both he and Benjamin Sesko were already off the mark and Cunha joined them with a fine finish to set United on their way.",
      "As Gary Neville said on commentary, it's too early to pass judgement on Sesko given he's adapting to a new league, although there are encouraging signs and the three of them did look good together after the Slovenia star was benched against Liverpool.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha, however, arrived at Old Trafford with Premier League pedigree - and right now they are living up to their top billing.",
      "After months of speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford, Carlos Baleba did step out at the Theatre of Dreams on Saturday evening, albeit in a Brighton shirt.",
      "Unfortunately for the Seagulls midfielder, he was on the losing side and once again looked a shell of the player who dazzled last season, with the much maligned Casemiro helped United win the midfield battle.",
      "It remains to be seen if United will rekindle their interest in Baleba, who was taken off just before the hour mark.",
      "Manchester United have looked so much better with Senne Lammens in goal but we was unable to prevent Danny Welbeck from bagging a superb consolation for Brighton.",
      "The United academy graduate is now 34 but continues to shine at the top level - so much so that he was even considered as an unlikely transfer target for his former club back in the summer.",
      "Unfortunately for he and Brighton, his super strike counted for nothing in the end.",
      "The nerves were palpable around Old Trafford when seven minutes of second half stoppage were added, which indicates here's still a long way to go before we can say for certain that United have turned a corner. But recent performances, which have matched the upturn in results, show things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Amorim deserves tremendous credit for shifting the momentum at United with the huge levels of scrutiny on him. There may still be some question marks hanging over the United boss, but with more results like this, they will soon become a thing of the past.",

As per The Sun, Greenwood's performances have left Barcelona weighing up a future transfer - and that could be huge news for Manchester United, who are understood to be entitled to 50 per cent of any sell-on fee.",

      "Former Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho scored his first goal for Chelsea against Sunderland on Saturday - and replicated a United celebration which reminded his former club just how much has changed in the last 20 months.",
      "The Argentina star left for Stamford Bridge in a £40million summer move and he isn't the only former starter forced out under Ruben Amorim. After finding the net against the Black Cats, Garnacho celebrated by sitting on the advertising hoarding, with team-mate Pedro Neto joining him. It brought to mind a near-identical celebration during United's victory over West Ham in February 2024, with Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund also involved, in a move which some read as mocking former Hammers star Mohammed Kudus.",
      "At the time, the trio were hailed as the future of United, with Hojlund scoring once and Garnacho twice in the 3-0 win. A defeat at West Ham nearly nine months later saw manager Erik ten Hag sacked, though, and his successor Amorim hasn't viewed the trio in the same way.",
      "Garnacho has completed a permanent exit, while Hojlund is expected to do the same after an initial loan switch to Napoli. Mainoo is still a United player, but has yet to start a league game this season.",
      "It shows just how quickly things can change in football. Not only have the three United players all found themselves in different cities, but Ten Hag has lost not one but two jobs, with his Bayer Leverkusen tenure lasting just 60 days.",
      "Garnacho's United exit was all but sealed by his reaction to being dropped for the Europa League final. The winger publicly criticised Amorim for the selection decision, despite coming off the bench as the Red Devils chased an equaliser in vain.",
      "“Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today - I don’t know,\" he said. \"I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”",

      "“The system isn't the problem. It's the execution of the system because every system has its pros and cons. If you opt for a 3-4-3 formation, you expect certain qualities. You need to create chances and score goals,” Sir Alex Ferguson’s former assistant told CasinoHawks.",
      "“To do that, you need possession, penetration, movement, and all the elements that come with it. You need crosses in the box and numbers in the box. Bruno has been dropped a little deeper, but he lacks defensive discipline, and that will still be exposed. That will still be exposed by other teams, maybe by a different system.",
      "“So, we can discuss it, but we'll come back to the same conclusion. Only when United go on a run of seven to eight wins in a row can you probably start to see that the players have clicked into the system.",
      "“Plenty of other teams play the same system and do it really, really well. No problem at all. But it would be a bit premature for me to say that just because they beat Liverpool.",
      "“Again, Liverpool missed so many chances to basically get a draw. If it were a draw, everyone would have said, ‘Okay, fair result. United defended well, but they didn't create much in the second half, or what they did create, they didn't put it in the back of the net.’ So, I would be a little bit reserved on that one.”",
      "Fernandes has been happy to do what is being asked of him by his manager, with summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha up front, supported by Mason Mount. The 31-year-old will make his 300th appearance for United on Saturday and Amorim has summed him up in the build-up to the game.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"The frustration that he feels is because he wants to help his team-mates a lot,” the United boss said. “Sometimes it's not the best way but he comes from a good place and you don't know that when you are not here. He wants the responsibility all the time.",
      "\"He suffers a lot with the losses. Every time we don't win a game, you can feel it. He takes it personally, as he should as a captain. He is a great leader, a great footballer, so let's see if he's going to reach that mark tomorrow.\"",

      "The Slovenia international made the move in the summer as part of an attacking overhaul by the Red Devils. Sesko was the only out-and-out striker United signed as they splashed £200million on their forward line, also adding Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. They had competition for the striker's signature, with Newcastle even moving for first for the ex-RB Leipzig star.",
      "The £74million signing was also linked to Arsenal for much of the summer. However, the Gunners could not agree a deal so instead turned their attention to Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres.",

When I heard that I can move here and there are big possibilities that I can change clubs, especially to United, I was burning. It’s something that I always wanted to have. It happened and I’m really happy.\"",
      "Sesko was asked if United was the only side he wanted to sign for and replied: \"Yeah. For me, this was a dream to play for a club like this and a stadium like this. It’s something that I always wanted.\"",

Amorim suggested it was a tactical decision as they overcame the Premier League champions. He explained: \"Cunha returning to the team - I think he's one player [who] has one characteristic that can help us to push the team forward.",

      "United host Fabian Hurzeler’s side on the back of two wins, with Ruben Amorim hoping to continue the new-found momentum. The home team will also have one eye on Brighton midfielder Baleba, having failed in an effort to sign him over the summer.",
      "Brighton received interest from United in the Cameroon international, but the move didn’t gather pace, with their sky-high asking price successfully deterring rivals from pursuing him. They quoted a price north of £100million, with the £115m they landed from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo setting the bar high.",
      "But Baleba reportedly remains keen to swap Brighton for United in the future and the opportunity to impress Amorim isn’t lost on him. Hurzeler had to answer questions about his midfielder in the pre-match press conference and likely won’t have been amused to see his Instagram post.",
      "The 21-year-old shared a graphic showing himself and advertising to his followers the match on Saturday at 5.30pm with the caption “Coming to Old Trafford” with a crying laughing emoji. Aware that his words could land him in hot water, he quickly deleted it and re-posted without the sarcastic caption – but not before it was spotted by fans.",
      "Baleba hasn’t been in the best of form this season but he was better in Brighton's 2-1 victory over Newcastle United last weekend to earn praise from his manager.",

      "“There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away. So we’ve had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he’s with us for this season.”",

      "Zinedine Zidane has been out of work for four years but continues to be linked with high-profile manager jobs, including at Manchester United. The French coach won two La Liga titles and oversaw a record three consecutive Champions League triumphs across his two reigns as Real Madrid boss.",
      "The 53-year-old decided to leave Los Blancos in 2021 after ending the season trophyless, but his managerial achievements have not been forgotten. Zidane was linked with the United job ahead of the Red Devils appointing Ruben Amorim last year, and he has once again been the subject of speculation this season.",
      "United have continued to falter under Amorim, but the Portuguese coach will hope that last weekend’s win over Liverpool can prove to be a turning point. Meanwhile, Zidane remains available and has previously addressed the idea of becoming United boss in the past.",
      "In 2022, when asked if he would consider taking a Premier League job, Zidane told L'Equipe: \"Never say never. Especially when you are a coach today. If I go back to a club, it is to win. I say this with all modesty.",
      "\"That's why I can't just go anywhere. For other reasons, too. Certain conditions make things more difficult. When someone says to me, 'Do you want to go to Manchester [United]?' I understand English but I don't fully master it.",
      "\"I know there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work differently. To win, many elements come into play. It's a global context. I know what I need to win.",
      "\"Of course, I might not always win, but I know that you need to have this, this and this. And I want to do everything on my side to optimise my chances of victory.\"",
      "Whether Zidane now feels his understanding of English is strong enough to succeed in the Premier League remains to be seen. However, he drew attention by attending a Real Betis training session last year.",
      "Zidane was reportedly in attendance to watch his son Elyaz in first-team training, but there were suggestions that the former Real Madrid boss was preparing for a return to work. Despite the continual links to United, Zidane could soon be in line to land his dream job.",
      "The World Cup winner recently reiterated his desire to manage France in the future. The opportunity may soon come his way as Zidane’s former teammate Didier Deschamps has confirmed that he intends to step down as manager after the 2026 World Cup, ending what will be 14 years in charge of Les Bleus.",
      "\"I will definitely return,\" Zidane said during an appearance at Festival dello Sport in Trento earlier this month. “In terms of the future, I don’t know. My feeling is that I want to be able to coach the national team in the future, even though I don’t mean right now. I would like to one day, but we’ll see.”",
      "However, Zidane is less certain about the possibility of managing Juventus, where he spent five years of his playing career. “I don't know. It hasn't happened before, I've made other choices,\" he said. \"Juve will always remain in my heart, it gave me a lot from the beginning when I went there. As for the future, I don't know.\"",

      "David Beckham has admitted to breaking an unwritten football rule before sacking ex-Manchester United team-mate Phil Neville. Beckham, a co-owner of Inter Miami, appointed the younger Neville brother as head coach of the MLS side in January 2021.",
      "He led the Herons to the MLS playoffs in 2022, before the team’s fortunes nosedived, leading to his sacking by Beckham in 2023 after 10 defeats in 15 games. Beckham has now revealed that he and fellow club owners had concerns about Neville’s tactics before pulling the trigger.",
      "While owners getting involved in team affairs is a big no-no in English football, Beckham had no qualms about telling the head coach his approach wasn’t working. Speaking to Gary Neville as part of a Salford City documentary series, Beckham addressed Phil’s time in Florida. He said ruefully: “Phil played five at the back in Miami, for six months.”",
      "A laughing Neville asked: “Did he play one up or two up? Beckham replied, rubbing his forehead: “One up! Five at the back and one up.”",
      "Neville then probed: “Did you tell him?” Beckham said: “Yeah, every day. We didn’t really have the philosophy of not telling the coach.”",
      "Beckham has said sacking Phil was one of the hardest things he’s had to do. Speaking to another former United colleague, Rio Ferdinand, he confessed: “Phil has been in management for a long time, and he knows what happens in management.",
      "“When I first bought in Phil to manage the team in Miami, I knew what he was going to do. I knew he was going to steady the ship. I knew that he was going to bring the work ethic that I’d seen over the years.",
      "“Everything had to be perfect with Phil. He brought everyone together and he changed that club overnight. The work that Phil did, it was incredible.",
      "“But Phil knew and he said, ‘If I’m not getting the results, I know what’s going to happen.’ And we’re close enough to have that conversation.",
      "“When he first came in, I said, ‘Phil, I don’t want this to affect our friendship.’ He said, ‘I get it, it won’t, when the time’s right, if it’s right, we’ll both know.’ And we had a very sensible conversation but I will never underestimate what he did for the club.",
      "“I think it was one of the most difficult things I’d had to do, even though me and Phil had spoke about it when he first came. I knew that if it came to this moment, it was going to be difficult, no matter what time it happened and when it happened.”",

      "Manchester United claimed their third win on the bounce after beating Brighton 4-2 on Saturday.",
      "Looking to follow up back-to-back Premier League victories against Sunderland and Liverpool either side of the international break, the Reds dispatched the Seagulls at Old Trafford, despite a late scare.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side stormed into a two-goal lead in the first half through Matheus Cunha's first United goal and Casemiro's deflected strike, before Bryan Mbeumo put the Reds 3-0 up in the second period.",
      "Brighton fought back late on with Danny Welbeck and Charalampos Kostoulas giving United something to be concerned about. However, Mbeumo scored United's fourth in stoppage-time to wrap up the win.",
      "While the immediate focus is on United's recent up-turn in form and next Saturday's trip to Nottingham Forest, there is still transfer talk bubbling in the air with the January transfer window around the corner.",
      "BILD have claimed that Bayern Munich didn't make a move for Bruno Fernandes because of his £300,000 per-week wage packet and the club's stacked attacking midfield department.",
      "Fernandes' current salary is said to be an 'obstacle' for Bayern, while Vincent Kompany's side have an abundance of options in the No.10 role including Jamal Musiala and Serge Gnabry.",
      "According to The Mirror, West Ham are leading the race to sign Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee during the January transfer window.",
      "Zirkzee has three-and-a-half years left on his United contract but has been left frustrated with his lack of game time this season. Indeed, he has played just 82 minutes in the Premier League.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ended the club's pursuit in Barcelona forward Robert Lewandowski, despite Ruben Amorim's eagerness to bring him to Old Trafford next summer, as per GOAL.",
      "Lewandowski, 37, is out of contract at Barca in June 2026 and there is talk that he could move to the Premier League, with United among those that have been linked. However, Ratcliffe doesn't want to sign the Poland international, who has scored four times in nine matches this season.",

      "\"We'll back him from the Stretford End, he'll turn the Reds around,\" was aired from the Stretford End following Manchester United's second goal against Brighton.",
      "It felt like Amorim had a mountain to climb after defeats to Grimsby Town and Manchester City, but wins bring positivity and Amorim has now overseen three on the bounce in the league. Liverpool had to be the turning point and United built on that performance against Brighton despite a nervy ending.",
      "The last time United won three league games in a row was in February 2024. Erik ten Hag was on the ropes shortly after that run, but Amorim has managed to get up from the canvas.",
      "Brighton had won six of their past seven league fixtures against United. The Seagulls were also trying to become the first Premier League club to win four in a row at Old Trafford. The unwanted records stacked up last season, but Brighton didn't leave Manchester with a slice of history this weekend.",
      "There was a rousing rendition of 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' before kick-off. \"We've seen it all, we've won the lot,\" echoed around the ground once the game kicked off. Amorim was quickly down on his haunches to scan from pitch level.",
      "United considered Carlos Baleba in the summer transfer window, but Brighton valued the midfielder in excess of £100million and had planned to keep him at the Amex Stadium for at least another season.",
      "Baleba has made an unconvincing start to the campaign. Fabian Hurzeler has suggested his form has dipped due to the noise around his future, but he started the midfielder at Old Trafford.",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox were present in the directors’ box. They have the power to sanction a move for Baleba, who would have seen the game as a transfer audition.",
      "Baleba's first notable involvement was a tame shot from the edge of the box in the first half. He dragged his shot wide, the Stretford End sarcastically cheered and Brighton's analysts shook their heads.",
      "Amorim was shaking his head shortly afterwards when Anthony Taylor failed to award a penalty when Amad was brought down to the ground. Amorim vented to the fourth official, which is not often seen.",
      "United used that refereeing decision to spur them on - and Cunha opened the scoring moments later. He finished brilliantly into the bottom right corner after a spell of sustained pressure and was mobbed by his teammates. The Brazilian's first goal since signing from Wolves was worth the wait.",
      "The atmosphere cranked up another notch following Cunha's goal and his international colleague, Casemiro, extended the advantage with a heavily deflected effort.",
      "United academy graduate Danny Welbeck will celebrate his 35th birthday next month, but he is not slowing down with age and returned to Old Trafford as one of the most in-form strikers in the country.",
      "Welbeck had scored four goals in his last three games, however, he came up against one of the most in-form defenders in the league. Matthijs de Ligt is enjoying a superb campaign and was solid again.",
      "There were huge cheers for De Ligt when he made an exceptional recovery challenge at the beginning of the second half. The matchgoing supporters are aware of his importance this season.",
      "There were even bigger cheers when Bryan Mbeumo scored his first. Mbeumo has been a brilliant addition and has needed no time to settle after signing from Brentford. The Cameroon international is a goal machine and netted again during added time to notch his fifth of the campaign.",
      "United's recruitment hit rate has been shocking in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but Mbeumo and Cunha had Premier League experience on their CV and are both players with United DNA.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made his 300th appearance for the club against Brighton and dictated play from the deeper role again. Fernandes wanted United to sign personalities in the summer - and they have. Amorim overhauled the attack in a single window, and the investment was worth every penny.",
      "United never make it easy for themselves, though. Amorim will not be pleased with Brighton's late surge, and their two late goals are a stark reminder that there is still plenty more work to do.",
      "But Amorim has finally put United on the right track.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Ruben Amorim praised Matheus Cunha and Casemiro after Manchester United's win against Brighton.",

      "Mbeumo wrapped up three points with a second goal in the 97th minute. Bruno Fernandes intelligently left a pass from Ayden Heaven and Mbeumo fired into the roof of the net to seal the victory.",
      "Amorim was asked about Cunha and said: \"I think everyone felt against Liverpool he feels more confident if the game is harder. He feels more comfortable and wants the responsibility.",
      "\"I really like the way he defends today. He was not jumping all the time. He was not jumping and returning to position without the right pace. Today he defends really well and when he has the ball I have no concerns. He was struggling about not scoring goals, he can try to hide.",
      "\"But I understand. He was really happy. But not just with Matheus, everyone understood really well how to beat a very good game.\"",
      "Amorim also praised Casemiro, saying: \"I think he gives a lot of experience, he is an example for everyone. In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer].",
      "\"But he fought and worked and now he is back in the national team. He is so important to us. He ran a lot, today he had to fight and press, and then return. I'm really pleased with him.",
      "\"And the other guys need to look at Casemiro. To understand that football can change really fast. You just need to work for me. If I think you are the best one to play a game, then you will.\"",
      "Amorim was asked how important the victory was and said: \"It was really important, also the performance, we had to play different games in different moments of the game.",
      "\"And I think the players understood really well what to do in every moment. We had to suffer a bit at the end, it wouldn’t be Manchester United without a bit of suffering, but we deserved the win against a very good team, a team that is hard to press against high, but we did really well.",
      "\"I think they [the players] are more confident, the best game we did this season was against Arsenal. But then when you are confident, you have a different spirit, that helps you to win games. That's what I'm feeling now. We're a little bit more free. Last week we are a bit more luck because of that.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"I have that feeling [that Brighton is a bigger win than Liverpool], I think it was a more complete performance. You can say whatever you want to say against Liverpool, but Liverpool did not deserve to win that game. Today we did everything. We had the ball and created chances.",
      "\"We defend high, we defend low and when it's more complete, it's not a statement, but I feel more complete as a manager. So today, I liked it more today than the last weekend.\"",
      "Amorim discussed his tactical approach, adding: \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression]. When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "The United boss also clarified Luke Shaw was substituted after suffering from a virus during the week. \"Luke is fine. He had the virus during the week. He struggled a little bit in the first half but he's fine,\" he said.",

United were cruising early in the second half as Mbeumo's first goal of the game put them 3-0 up after Matheus Cunha and Casemiro had scored in the first half. However, a Danny Welbeck free-kick and a late Charalampos Kostoulas goal set up a nervy finish to the game.",

      "After Dorgu was handed a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor, VAR looked at the incident again and deemed that the caution didn't need upgrading. While United fans were relieved that the ex-Lecce man didn't get sent off, they were infuriated as the free-kick took place more than five yards ahead of where the foul was committed.",
      "As seen in video and photo footage of the incident, Dorgu fouled Minteh when the Brighton forward was around 28 yards from goal. However, Welbeck took the eventual free-kick less than 23 yards away from the posts.",

      "The 15-year-old has earned his place in the national setup, achieving something his legendary father never managed - representing Portugal at U16 level. Whilst Ronaldo Sr featured for various Portuguese youth teams before his senior debut in 2003, he bypassed the U16 stage entirely.",
      "His son will now have the opportunity to represent his country in the upcoming Football Federations Cup in Antalya, Turkey, scheduled between October 30 and November 4.",
      "The youngster, who is currently plying his trade at Al-Nassr's academy in the Saudi Pro League, was amongst 22 players selected for the tournament. Although Cristiano Jr is still in the early stages of what could become a promising football career, his father remains careful not to apply excessive pressure.",
      "The 40-year-old previously explained to former Manchester United team-mate Rio Ferdinand: \"Right in this moment, Cristiano wants to be a football player but I don't make big pressure, I make a little. He has pressure already to be the son of Cristiano [senior].\"",
      "Elements of their father-son dynamic have been witnessed publicly, including disciplinary measures the younger Ronaldo has faced and moments when communication between them broke down.",
      "Ronaldo has frequently shared glimpses of the gym sessions and football training he conducts with his eldest son, and the Al-Nassr icon maintains his exacting standards even when it comes to his own children.",
      "A penalty specialist himself, Ronaldo has sought to enhance his son's abilities from the spot, and in a social media clip from nine years ago, he challenged a then 5-year-old Ronaldo Jr: \"If you don't score, you have to do 10 push-ups,\" before offering his son three attempts to convert a penalty.",
      "Following a miss on his initial effort, he came closer by striking the post on his second go and managed to find the net with his final spot-kick, which he slotted home. Despite finding the target, Ronaldo still demanded his son complete the push-up forfeit, with Ronaldo Jr protesting: \"But I scored,\" before being instructed: \"Do them [the push-ups] anyway. Come on, only 10.\"",
      "Amongst his numerous extraordinary qualities that have elevated Ronaldo into the exclusive group of players considered amongst football's all-time greats, his competitive spirit certainly ranks highly.",
      "During a discussion with former teammate and Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand on his UR Cristiano YouTube channel, he disclosed it's a trait that has been inherited by Cristiano Jr.",
      "Ronaldo confessed that his son mirrors his hatred of defeat, as he explained: \"I was in the Red Sea a couple of days ago, and I played paddle every day, me and Cristiano Jr., and we got mad,\" the 40-year-old revealed. He added: \"He won't speak with me for like, two days. This is why I'm happy. Even the small one, Mateo, they are at peace (when they are angry), but I like this, it shows they have personality.\"",
      "Cristiano Jr was born a year after his father departed Manchester United for Real Madrid, but was able to witness the affection the Red Devils supporters maintained for the Portuguese legend upon his return to Old Trafford in 2021.",
      "What began as a storybook second debut campaign for Ronaldo, who netted 24 goals in 38 appearances, his second and final season proved catastrophic following his deteriorating relationship with then-boss Erik Ten Hag.",
      "Prior to his contract being terminated in November 2022, Ronaldo was excluded from the squad to face Chelsea following his outburst during the Tottenham Hotspur match. The forward declined to enter as a substitute in the closing stages against Spurs, before marching down the tunnel and leaving the ground prior to the final whistle.",
      "During his explosive interview with Piers Morgan on Talk TV, Ronaldo revealed how Cristiano Jr responded upon discovering the circumstances surrounding his father's suspension, confessing it left him feeling \"humiliated\".",
      "He recounted to Morgan: \"I remember arriving home and Cristiano see me and say, 'Daddy do you not go to the game?' I say, 'No, because the club punish me with three days'. And then he said, 'How are they going to punish you if you are the best player in the world and you're not gonna play?' I said, 'No I'm not gonna play because I have not been behave'. And he look at me like, 'My Daddy not behave, what?\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has reacted to Manchester United's 4-2 win over Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday evening. The Reds' victory over Fabian Hurzeler's team was their third consecutive win, following wins over Liverpool last weekend and Sunderland before the October international break.",
      "United began strongly as they took a 2-0 lead through a curler from Matheus Cunha and a deflected effort by Casemiro. The match seemed all but won when Bryan Mbeumo scored his first goal of the game, beating Bart Verbruggen at his near post.",
      "However, Brighton weren't ready to throw in the towel just yet. After Patrick Dorgu narrowly escaped a red card, Danny Welbeck came back to haunt his former club by scoring from the resulting free kick.",
      "The Old Trafford atmosphere turned tense when Charalampos Kostoulas headed in at the near post from a corner. But it was Ayden Heaven's precise through ball to Mbeumo that sealed the deal, with the Cameroonian firing home and celebrating in front of the Stretford End.",
      "And Sesko has shown his true colours by choosing to focus on the team and their mentality after grabbing his first assist for United.",
      "\"Great team win, great mentality!\" he said in a post on Instagram, alongside several pictures of him in action on Saturday.",
      "\"Happy for my first assist in Red! We keep going!\"",
      "Amorim was asked how important the victory was and said: \"It was really important, also the performance, we had to play different games in different moments of the game.",
      "\"And I think the players understood really well what to do in every moment. We had to suffer a bit at the end, it wouldn’t be Manchester United without a bit of suffering, but we deserved the win against a very good team, a team that is hard to press against high, but we did really well.",
      "\"I think they [the players] are more confident, the best game we did this season was against Arsenal. But then when you are confident, you have a different spirit, that helps you to win games. That's what I'm feeling now. We're a little bit more free. Last week we are a bit more luck because of that.\"",
      "He added: \"I have that feeling [that Brighton is a bigger win than Liverpool], I think it was a more complete performance. You can say whatever you want to say against Liverpool, but Liverpool did not deserve to win that game. Today we did everything. We had the ball and created chances.",
      "\"We defend high, we defend low and when it's more complete, it's not a statement, but I feel more complete as a manager. So today, I liked it more today than the last weekend.\"",

      "\"I can sing, but not well,\" laughed Bruno Fernandes when he recalled his initiation after signing for Manchester United. \"We had a lot of Latin people, so I went for a Spanish song because I knew they would sing with me.\"",
      "Fernandes was signed from Sporting Lisbon for an initial £46.6million in January 2020. United felt they had sealed a bargain, but nobody could have imagined the impact he would make in Manchester.",
      "Fernandes has scored 100 goals, contributed 84 assists, won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year four times and he is set to make his 300th appearance against Brighton this weekend.",
      "The 31-year-old has given his prime years to United. Fernandes was prolific in his first season for the club and never looked back. \"I don't know why I did it, some people get more difficulties to do it,\" said Fernandes about his electric start to life at United five years ago.",
      "\"It's a huge club, huge league, the difference between this league and any other one in the world is massive, not in terms of quality, but also the intensity, the way the football is played, everything is very different.",
      "\"I don't know, I was just hungry enough to do everything, because for me, I've said this many times, the first chance was the last one, so I had to make it. There was nothing else in my head other than making it in the Premier League, because it was my dream to play for this club for many years.\"",
      "That dream almost came to an end in the summer when Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal made a huge financial offer to sign United's captain. Fernandes puffed his cheeks as he conceded their offer was \"very good\".",
      "He explained: \"I spoke with Cristiano [Ronaldo] about the situation, about Saudi and everything. I wouldn’t say what he told me, but we spoke about it. Obviously, he now has a manager who also spoke with me at the time (Jorge Jesus). He was at Al-Hilal three years ago.",
      "\"The first thing he said to me, ‘Are you too expensive for the club?’. I said, ‘There is no expensive players for that club!’. But I told him the same, I wasn’t eager to move, to go to Saudi Arabia, because I wanted to stay at the club. And he’s a manager I have a big relationship with.",
      "\"He was the one who trusted me to go to Sporting and to play in the biggest stages. But Cristiano told me, he had his opinion on what I should do. It was important for me.",
      "\"Obviously, with all the experience he has and everything, it was important for me to hear what he thought. But obviously, the decision will always come to me and to the club.\"",
      "Fernandes laughed as he agreed that the opinion of someone even closer to him, his wife, Ana Pinho, mattered more than Ronaldo's thoughts.",
      "\"It was very important because it was obviously the first question when I spoke to her,\" he said.",
      "\"I said, look, we have this offer from Saudi. This is because I've never spoke about this is an offer from me. We always speak in the big family. We always say we have an offer from Saudi because obviously wherever I have to go, they have to come. They can choose not, but I'd prefer them to come.",
      "\"And obviously, the first thing she said was, 'Have you achieved everything you wanted to achieve at the club?'. Because she knows I haven't. And when I talk about I haven't fulfilled my dreams at the club, it comes a lot from what she said to me. But if I don't try it, that's for sure I won't make it.\"",
      "Fernandes was asked whether the door to Saudi Arabia was now closed. He responded: \"I don’t know. At the moment, no one spoke with me about anything. As I said last time, I will even say to you, if someone told me, like, ‘In the summer, look, we’ll come again.’ No one told that to me. I don’t think they [Al-Hilal] were very happy for me to reject the offer, obviously. I accept that.\"",
      "He outlined that he was happy at United and would not entertain discussions about his future until after the World Cup. \"We're very happy to be here,\" he said about his family life.",
      "Fernandes arrived to speak with Manchester-based correspondents shortly before 9am on Friday morning, and there was a spring in his step after winning against Liverpool.",
      "\"It was good, obviously, very positive,\" he said about this week's training sessions. \"Ten years to now, we didn't have a good result there, not a good result, but a win, so it was very positive.\"",
      "Fernandes captained United to their first win at Anfield since 2016. He was given the armband two years ago and is seen as the ultimate standard-setter in the dressing room. Fernandes even watched the first team train in the rain when he was given additional time off last week.",
      "He already knows the names of academy players when they are promoted to senior training, and offered to pay for staff to attend the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "The Portugal international is a modern club legend. \"I just try to do things in a way that I can help the team and help the club to be closer to succeeding,\" he reflected.",
      "\"I haven't been much able to give the success that this club wants and deserves, and also the success that I wanted in my head to get when I signed for United, because when I came to the club that was my aim. I knew I was coming for a big club that played for big targets.",
      "\"And that's why I wanted this challenge. I've been lucky enough to do well, but as I always say, I haven't done well enough because I haven't achieved what I want.",
      "\"Every season I come back, I always have the belief that we can achieve something because you can have a very bad season, then you come back, you start the pre-season, you see the mood, because obviously the pre-season the mood is always very soft and very happy.",
      "\"There are tough training sessions and everything. But you always start to see certain things, like this season we might achieve what we want, but obviously, we know there is much more behind that.",
      "\"Everyone knows my aim is to win the Premier League and the Champions League with the club. If I'm going to do it or not, I'm not going to be able to tell you.",
      "\"Because if I were able to tell you, I would be very happy at this moment that I know that I'm going to win in some moment in these three years, [that] I'm going to win either the Premier League or the Champions League, but I can't tell that. If that's my aim and also the aim for the club, as they say, that's the truth.\"",
      "United's victory against Newcastle in the 2023 Carabao Cup final provided Fernandes with his first trophy at the club, but he considers the FA Cup triumph against Manchester City as an even sweeter success.",
      "When asked which trophy meant more, Fernandes said: \"The Carabao Cup is very special because it's the first one, but I think the FA Cup, not because it was against City, but because it's much bigger in England for the fans, for the football, it's the first domestic cup in the world.",
      "\"So it's a big pleasure for us. I had my brother living here before I came, so I knew already about history, about going to Wembley and all these things. I had the chance to go to Wembley in the semi-final against Chelsea, where we lost, but obviously with the empty stadium.",
      "\"I didn't feel the exact mood of the Wembley day. It was very special, obviously, because I know how much it means to the FA Cup, for the fans, for the club and for the country also.\"",
      "Fernandes has been fixated on winning the Premier League. United have gone through ups and downs since his arrival, and he advised decision-makers in the summer to sign players with personalities.",
      "He explained: \"Every time I spoke with anyone who was talking with me, they were asking we need to sign good players and everything else. We need to sign big characters, not good players because at this club, being good players sometimes is not enough because of the pressure, because of the attention we get and everything.",
      "\"I think we brought in players [in the summer] that are very aware of the dimension of the club. You spoke about [Matheus] Cunha. Cunha has that good arrogance to do the good things and the right things, so that's something good.",
      "\"Bryan [Mbeumo], also the same. He's not afraid to take the ball, to do his play, to do his things. We brought two players who were aware of the Premier League. And then we brought a very young goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] and a centre-forward [Benjamin Sesko], and they hit the ground running.",
      "\"Obviously, we know that Ben will be judged by scoring goals or not. But a part of that, he's been doing great, whatever he's being asked to do. He's got his goals already, and I think now it's going to come more and more because he's more than capable of scoring goals.\"",
      "Fernandes continued: \"Senne came probably with the intention of being the number one. He had to wait for his moment. The moment came and he was ready for that. So this is what this club is about. You come, the moment will be there straightaway and you have to take it.",
      "\"I think these four players were very good in taking that opportunity of ‘I want to be the one that is playing every week’. When we speak about Cunha, the thing of having the arrogance to say ‘give me the ball, I want to play, I want to make things’.",
      "\"With time, sometimes it won't be good for people because I've been through that. He always wants the ball, he's always doing this, he's always doing that. But for us, on the inside, we want this Cunha. We want you to take the risks, to shoot, to take people on, to create.",
      "\"Bryan, the same. Bryan, just get your shots on. Sometimes I get upset with him in training because he's like, one touch more, one touch more and everything. I say, ‘Bryan, you don't need that. You can one touch and shoot because you're more than able to do that. You did that against us when you were at Brentford!",
      "\"You just have to make it for us now. The shirts have changed, but you're the same player so we need that from you. Ben is very eager to learn and that's very good from someone that has done very well in the Bundesliga and everything, came with the biggest, probably like the price tag and everything.",
      "\"But in his mind, he's like, 'I want to learn, I want to become better'. Then on the weekends, he transforms himself into a different person on the pitch. He's someone that is like, ‘I know what I have to do. I want to score goals. I'm going to get into the box, I'm going to get into duels. I'm going to win my headers’. And that's very important for us.\"",
      "It was typical of Fernandes that he spent time praising United's new arrivals during an interview organised to mark his 300th appearance for the club - that is the type of person he is.",
      "Fernandes also demonstrated his humour when he was asked about Ruben Amorim jokingly telling Sir Jim Ratcliffe to 'f*** off'. \"I don't know about that,\" he said. \"I haven't said that to Sir Jim yet!",
      "\"When he comes along to the training ground, we always see him. We talk a little bit with him, but he doesn't get much involved in technical things with us. Obviously, I don't think we'll be able to do that as we're not able to do the work he does. But we have a good connection with him.",
      "\"Every player, I think, every time he comes, he tries to see everyone, talk to everyone. More or less, that's it. Obviously, he has Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] who are more close to us to get the message through back and forwards. I think that's the normal relationship in a football club.\"",
      "Fernandes' contract expires in the summer of 2027, and there is an option for an extension. \"Yes,\" he answered about whether his time at United has been successful. \"Because when I came to the club, as you said, it was a dream. So to fulfil that dream is success. To be playing football is success.",
      "\"I wanted to play football, but I never dreamed... Not dream, I dreamed, but I was never very sure that I would reach the level I reached. I just wanted to play football.",
      "\"I didn't have a level on my head of how high I wanted to be. I just wanted to be happy doing what I do, because there's not much I can do apart from football. So I would say yes. Obviously, I wouldn't have every trophy in the cabinet that I wanted, but it would still be a success for me.\"",
      "Fernandes admitted he could explore a career in coaching when he eventually retires, but he still has more to give for United. \"I have to run much more than I do anything else,\" he said about maintaining his level.",
      "\"In football nowadays, you have to be able to run. At the high level now, there's so much difference to when I started playing, I had players who played with me that could run 6-7km a game and would be top still.",
      "\"Nowadays, if you run less than 9-10km, I would say you're really down on your numbers already. Obviously, I'm lucky enough to be very able of running and to deal with the demands of the manager, of the league and everything. I can't tell how long I will be able of doing it, but I've never had problems with this side of the game.",
      "\"But obviously, it's not just that. The competition when it comes to the club, I want to have the best competitions to play in my position. For example, as the manager said, I don't think Kobbie [Mainoo] is a competition at the same time, because I think Kobbie is very capable of doing what I can do in a different way.",
      "\"Because obviously, if you look at the numbers, Bruno is more capable of scoring goals, probably Kobbie is more capable of taking on people. We're different as players, but we still can give very good things to the team in a different way. So, I like the competition and the fact of having Kobbie that is very young, but very capable of playing high-level football, because he makes me improve, he makes me be a better player.\"",
      "Fernandes was pictured with a 300th appearance shirt at Carrington shortly after the interview. \"I framed all the shirts from the first game of every club I played,\" he explained.",
      "\"And then I have the special ones, like if I win a cup or win a trophy. For example, with the club, the first time I was captain, we played with the black and white kit in PSG away.",
      "\"So I've kept that one and the armband too. So it's small things, but it's what I'm going to keep from the future. For the future, when I look back, obviously you can go on YouTube and stuff like that, but I would like to keep my own memorable stuff for my kids in the future to look at.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher must burst with pride when he watches his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, play in the academy.",
      "The 41-year-old was in attendance at Oakwell Stadium and had a perfect view of Jack's goal.",
      "Chido Obi brilliantly won the ball from Vimal Yoganathan just outside the Barnsley penalty area, and Jack Fletcher pounced to finish into the right corner thanks to a slight deflection.",
      "Fletcher scored an instinctive volley from 35 yards that dipped under the crossbar when he last played at Oakwell Stadium in 2024. His deflected goal may not have been as impressive, but they all count.",
      "Manchester United signed the Fletcher twins for £1.25million from Manchester City in the summer of 2023. The pair opted to move to United and are now pushing towards being involved with the first team.",
      "United use the EFL trophy to give 'elite young players' the platform to perform in a more pressured environment which prepares them for the first team.",
      "Travis Binnion named an Under-21 team that included players on the cusp of the first team against Barnsley, with Chido Obi, Shea Lacey, Tyler Fredricson and Diego Leon all starting.",
      "Leon made his international debut for Paraguay during the international break. He said it was an \"unforgettable night\" but he was back down to earth starting in South Yorkshire a week later.",
      "In August, there was a sense of frustration among academy staff that Leon had exclusively worked with the first team when he could have benefited from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The 18-year-old is still very raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer window arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "The Paraguay international struggled for the U21s against Liverpool and looked better against Barnsley, although he still has lots to learn, which was highlighted when he attempted to make an adventurous run through the middle of the pitch, only to be dispossessed in a dangerous area.",
      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",
      "The U21 boss cut a frustrated figure again just before the interval when Barnsley were awarded a penalty after a foul from Dan Armer. Veteran striker David McGoldrick made no mistake from the spot.",
      "Stephen Torpey sat alongside Jason Wilcox. The pair recently sat together at Old Trafford following Torpey's appointment as head of the academy (succeeding Nick Cox).",
      "Torpey and Wilcox returned to the warmth during half-time while Darren Fletcher passed on tactical feedback to an analyst. Fletcher is the Under-18 manager, but had clearly spotted something.",
      "It didn't take long for Barnsley to take the lead when play resumed. McGoldrick, 37, rolled back the years when finishing beyond Will Murdock again, although Obi produced an immediate response at the other end.",
      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",
      "However, former Ipswich Town, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest striker McGoldrick wasn't done there and netted his hat-trick. Then Jack Fletcher was shown a red card in a bizarre incident with the referee.",
      "It seemed Fletcher received his marching orders for dissent. Perhaps a strange decision, but his father might argue that there is a lesson to learn: you must control emotions on a football pitch.",
      "Barnsley smelt blood after the sending off and scored another two goals to claim a 5-2 victory. Wilcox had seen enough with seven minutes remaining, but Torpey remained in the stands to see the game out.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "However, Ferdinand’s recent success with his YouTube channel and podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents, which includes the ex-England international interviewing top current and former players, has led Ronaldo to joke that he has to be more careful about what he says in front of him.",
      "Ferdinand said while laughing in an interview with The Times: “It’s funny because Cristiano [Ronaldo] calls me a journalist now. He messaged me saying, ‘Now I can’t say too much in the United WhatsApp group, Rio’s in there. Rio the journalist!’”",
      "Ferdinand recently sat down for bombshell discussions with former England team-mates Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen on the platform. Prior to that, he interviewed past and present United stars like Wayne Rooney, Harry Maguire, Nemanja Vidic and Evra, several of whom are in the aforementioned group chat.",
      "The 46-year-old once provided an insight into what the icons speak about, saying they use it to critique the current team and joke around as they did in the dressing room. He even joked that Evra “regularly leaves” because he “gets bullied in there”.",
      "Evra himself said: “We are lucky, the United group, we still have a WhatsApp group. Every morning we just laugh with each other. We have still got that.",
      "“It is most of the players from 2008 when we won the Champions League. It is really active. Every two minutes.",
      "“Rio created it. We just keep connected and have a laugh. It was not just a team, it was like a family.”",
      "The likes of Dimitar Berbatov, Edwin van der Sar and Nani are also involved, while former captain Vidic left after growing frustrated with the number of text notifications he was receiving.",
      "“Vida [Vidic] came in for ten minutes then left,” Ferdinand said. “How long did you come in for? One day maybe? He didn't like the notifications, the messages coming through - a hundred messages.”",
      "“It's a metaphor for the dressing room so you should come back,” Berbatov told Vidic. “Change with time, you need to speak. (Laughing) In a way it's like me progressing and you regressing.”",

      "Wayne Rooney finds himself unable to attend his son Kai's matches for Manchester United's academy due to the overwhelming attention his celebrity status attracts. The 15-year-old is the eldest of four boys shared by Rooney and his wife Coleen, alongside younger brothers Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, who plays as a striker much like his iconic father, became part of the Red Devils' academy setup in 2016, treading the same path as Rooney Sr, who marks his 40th birthday today. Whilst the youngster still has considerable ground to cover on his route to professional football, he's considered a promising prospect within the Old Trafford ranks.",
      "Sadly for the former England skipper, he must observe his son's performances from afar after the emerging talent requested his father stay away from matches due to the overwhelming media circus that follows him.",
      "This heartbreaking situation came to light during Coleen's stint on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old claimed second place in the hit reality programme behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, and it was whilst in the jungle that she revealed the difficult choice her son had made.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Whilst he might not be present on the sidelines during Kai's matches, he continues to play a significant part in his footballing development. Rooney has previously acknowledged that he generally leaves the coaching duties to the club's coaching staff, but ensures he offers guidance to his sons during practice sessions at home.",
      "During last month's instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he told Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Considering Kai's position as the offspring of one of England's most celebrated players, Rooney commended his psychological resilience in handling the additional scrutiny and expectations that accompany being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim caught staff off guard when he smashed a TV monitor the last time Manchester United met Brighton.",
      "Back in January, the Red Devils lost 3-1 to the Seagulls, a defeat that infamously led Amorim to brand his team \"maybe the worst in the history\" of the club. Following that match, an enraged Amorim tore into his squad inside the dressing room, blasting them for an uninspired and lethargic display.",
      "Amid the outburst, he reportedly shattered a screen used for tactical briefings. It was an unprecedented moment for the 40-year-old, who is usually known for keeping his post-match comments concise and controlled, regardless of the result.",
      "Normally, Amorim prefers to analyse games with his team the next day, once tempers have cooled, hence the surprise inside Old Trafford at his actions. The incident seemed to spark an immediate reaction, as United went on to win four of their next five fixtures across all competitions.",
      "Nevertheless, the campaign still ended in disappointment. Amorim's men finished 15th in the Premier League - the lowest placement in club history - and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "As they prepare for Saturday's meeting with Brighton, United's first since Amorim's TV-smashing episode, the mood inside the camp feels completely transformed. Last weekend's 2-1 triumph over Liverpool, clinched by a late Harry Maguire header, has temporarily lifted the mood around Old Trafford.",
      "It marked United's second straight Premier League win - Amorim's first time securing consecutive league victories. Another success against Brighton would make it three in a row for the first time since February 2024.",
      "That, however, will be no easy task given United's recent poor record against the south-coast side. They have lost six of their last eight clashes with Brighton, while Fabian Hurzeler's team completed a league double over them last season.",
      "Amorim will be eager to reverse that trend - not only to gain a bit of revenge, but also to preserve the rare sense of momentum growing at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite the improved results and better performances, Amorim's future is far from concrete. The former Sporting CP boss must find consistency if he hopes to keep his job, and he cannot afford to let this resurgence fade.",
      "Securing a result against Brighton is therefore crucial and could be the key difference between building lasting confidence or sending United spiralling back into another stretch of instability and doubt.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Ruben Amorim has made no secret of his disappointment in the players who failed his predecessor, Erik ten Hag.",
      "It's nearly a year since Ten Hag was given his marching orders by Manchester United after a dismal start to the 2024/25 season. The Dutchman couldn't capitalise on the potential shown by winning both domestic cups, joining the lengthy list of managers to be ditched since Sir Alex Ferguson's glorious tenure ended in 2013.",
      "It was evident that Ten Hag had a strained relationship with several of his players, including some he had recruited himself. In the final stages of his reign, it came to light that the ex-Ajax boss felt particularly let down by three senior players: Marcus Rashford, Casemiro and Antony. He had previously coached the latter in the Netherlands before signing him for over £80million.",
      "Ten Hag believed the trio could have done more to secure the results that would have prolonged his time at Old Trafford. He was succeeded by Amorim, who has encountered similar challenges in extracting top performances from some of United's high-profile players.",
      "After taking the reins in November last year, he quickly fell out with Rashford, dropping him from his squad and then sanctioning his loan move to Aston Villa. Rashford secured another loan, to Barcelona, in the summer and is keen to make it permanent, cutting ties with his boyhood club once and for all.",
      "Antony was swiftly moved on after failing to make an impression on Amorim. After a loan spell at Real Betis during the second half of last season, the head coach approved his transfer to the La Liga side for around £22m, despite this resulting in a significant loss of £60m.",
      "Amorim was also open to parting ways with Casemiro, both in January and over the summer, but United were unable to offload the high-earning Brazilian.",
      "A £15m fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). With no club willing to stump up that kind of cash for a player in his 30s, he ended up staying put.",
      "Rather than merely seeing out the final season of his contract, Casemiro has proven to be one of Amorim's more dependable players this season, given the responsibility of protecting the back four and disrupting play.",
      "As he looks to build on the momentum of finally securing consecutive league victories, Amorim will need players like Casemiro to maintain their form. However, as Rashford, Antony and others have discovered, Amorim isn't afraid to sideline any player who refuses to buy into his methods.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

I suspect most Liverpool fans were casting very envious glances at Kelleher tonight. Mama is not helped by everyone passing to his right foot when he’s left footed. But that makes sense because this group looked tonight like they’d never met one another. Just 11 guys pulled together for a match last minute.",
      "A lot of criticism will deservedly be levelled at Slot. Mo, Kerkez and others were all poor but he chose the team and, astoundingly, chose to leave Mo on the pitch when he made his subs. He also somehow saw that joke first half and waited until 60 minutes and 3-1 down to make changes.",

      "Yet again, for the 427th time this season, Liverpool scored long after the indicated allotted level of injury time and, I think we can all agree, the amount of Fergie time being afforded to them is simply unprecedented. The ref was too embarrassed to even come out for the second half, and so we got another numerically illiterate official in his place. Who then provided the first instance, in my memory anyway (somebody fact-check that for me), of a team being awarded a corner because the GK held onto the ball too long (more than 8 seconds).",
      "The ref is supposed to provide a visual countdown with his fingers for the last 5 seconds. Watch it back, the GK gets rid around 7/8 seconds and the players complain he wasn’t given proper visual warning by the ref. Bear in mind Brentford did a lot more time wasting against United and weren’t punished in the same manner.

Either all stoppages are clear and transparent, with a specific clock for stoppages that all can see, or the current team of officials should be sent back to primary school to learn how to count and how to tell the time. (There is a third option of not allowing Liverpool any injury time unless they have a narrow lead, but we’ll hold that one back for now to see how things shake out).",
      "The irony of course is that the back-pass rule was basically invented due to Liverpool wasting time, passing the ball between CBs and GK once they had any sort of a lead (somebody fact-check that for me please).

      "Manchester United are being linked with midfielder after midfielder, making it increasingly unclear what type of player Ruben Amorim actually wants to sign.",
      "Sporting CP’s Morten Hjulmand is a player Man Utd have reportedly been tracking for some time, and his name has been thrown in the mix once again by Portuguese outlet Record (via Sport Witness).",
      "The report claims that Man Utd and Man City are both interested in signing Hjulmand, with a ‘January transfer battle’ on the cards.",
      "His form has unsurprisingly ‘caught the attention’ of the Manchester giants and they are ‘following him closely’ ahead of the winter window.",
      "Both clubs have links to Sporting through United boss Amorim and City’s director of football Hugo Viana, which means they both know the 26-year-old well — and that it’s a very easy transfer rumour to make up.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas said there was interest in the summer and that Hjulmand turned down offers to ‘triple his salary’, but the report claims that January could present him with ‘headaches’ as City and United ‘promise’ to move for the midfielder.",
      "Hjulmand will reportedly pick up a loyalty bonus if he stays at Sporting until the end of the season, and the Portuguese club are adamant they won’t negotiate below his €80m (£69.8m) release clause.",
      "On Friday, we covered a story from Fichajes linking Athletic Club’s Oihan Sancet, and another from talkSPORT linking six other midfielders with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Surprisingly, Hjulmand’s name wasn’t mentioned by the latter, which claimed Man Utd are open to signing two midfielders in 2026 — with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Chelsea’s Andrey Santos, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller all appreciated.",
      "Hjulmand, a long-time target, becomes the eighth player added to Amorim’s midfield shortlist.",
      "The quantity of midfield targets proves that Man Utd are serious about strengthening in that area — but the quality and variety is confusing.",
      "The fact that Man Utd are reportedly considering signing two midfielders is a caveat, but the different profiles being linked with the Red Devils either shows they don’t know what they want — or that those reporting are just guessing. Or both. Definitely both.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has the ability to drop deep and dictate the tempo, but he’s wasted in those areas. United need him further up the pitch because he’s the most reliable goalscorer and creator Amorim has in his squad.",
      "What he doesn’t have are the defensive capabilities. He’s nothing like a prime Casemiro — the kind Amorim wishes he had — and he’s not a Patrick Vieira type who bombs up and down the pitch, winning tackles and making interceptions.",
      "With Fernandes an undisputed starter in Amorim’s midfield two, it’s clear the Portuguese boss needs a much more industrious player alongside him. Literally, if Casemiro were five years younger…",
      "There will be no unearthing of hidden gems like United almost managed with Moises Caicedo. Unknown quantities like Baleba and Santos — or under-the-radar Premier League and Championship ballers like Anderson and Wharton — are now commanding fees in a completely different stratosphere to what their current clubs paid.",
      "Stiller and Santos are similar in that they can play as a No.6, 8, or 10, but their best role isn’t what United need to become more defensively stable and get the best out of Fernandes.",
      "Gallagher is similar, but everyone knows what you’ll get from him: energy. The guy has an unparalleled engine and is a manager’s dream. But is he someone with the ability to dictate tempo and provide the defensive output required for Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system? Probably not.",
      "Baleba, Wharton and Anderson are all Premier League-proven and the right profile for Man Utd. Brighton midfielder Baleba is the perfect signing for me, Clive.",
      "Hjulmand is similar but lacks Premier League experience. He might be the most attractive signing of all eight players, but there’s no way United should be paying £70m.",
      "And then Sancet barely deserves a mention. He’s an attacking midfielder — and the source is, well, sh**.",
      "We all know Baleba will be the guy United sign at the end of the season. He’s going to cost around £100m, though. And knowing Man Utd, they won’t hesitate to pay it."

      "Last weekend, Man Utd earned their most important win to date under Amorim as they deserved earned a rare win at Anfield, beating Liverpool 2-1 thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire.",
      "Amorim masterminded a great plan to get the better of Liverpool as he went for a direct approach and Slot had no answer for it as his side suffered their fourth straight loss in all competitions.",
      "Slot did not take this too well as the Liverpool head coach made a petty comment about Man Utd’s style after his team’s damaging 2-1 defeat.",
      "Slot said: “It is always difficult to play against a team that defends in a low block and mainly plays the long ball.”",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Slot has since added that these comments were meant as a “compliment” rather than a dig. He added: “We faced a team that had their game plan very well in order.",
      "“There was a bit of a debate over what I said after the game, but it was meant to be a compliment… so, they had a low block and played a lot of long balls. I was asked why it was difficult, and that was the reason.”",
      "Now, Amorim has insisted that he doesn’t care “what Slot is saying” as only he should “evaluate” his team.",
      "“I don’t care what Slot is saying,” Amorim admitted to reporters.",
      "“I can watch the game and say we can do better, and we need to do better in the future, but sometimes you need to adapt to the game.",
      "“So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team.”",
      "Man Utd’s four marquee summer signings, Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo, have impressed in recent matches and were key to the victory against Liverpool.",
      "Lammens looks to be a clear upgrade on former No.1 Andre Onana, and Amorim has revealed why he has been “surprised” by the young goalkeeper.",
      "“I think a little bit because it’s hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he’s not a young kid but he’s still young,” Amorim responded when asked whether he has been taken aback by Lammens’ start at Man Utd.",
      "“He coped really well with the pressure, he’s really composed, he’s defending really well. The importance of playing with both feet to kick the ball is so important nowadays, especially when you have to play against Liverpool in a more direct style.",
      "“I’m a little bit surprised, but I was expecting a talented guy. But yes, a little bit surprised.”",

      "Marcus Rashford has sent a message to Man Utd that he wants to stay at Barcelona once his loan spell comes to an end in the summer.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Rashford is “sending very clear messages” about his future as Barcelona consider triggering the option in the loan deal from Man Utd.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Rashford is doing great at Barcelona. Rashford is sending very clear messages.",
      "“His desire to be a Barcelona player is there since January 2025. Almost one year ago, in the January window, it was not possible to make the deal happen because Barcelona didn’t have the space to register and sign Rashford because Ansu Fati didn’t want to leave the club in January.",
      "“Then in the summer, Ansu Fati accepted the possibility to leave Barcelona, went to Monaco, Barcelona had the space to sign Rashford and they completed the transfer on a loan deal with a €30 million buy option clause.",
      "“Now, Rashford is performing in a fantastic way, already reaching 10 goal contributions between goals and assists, doing very well also in the Champions League, can play as a striker, can play as a winger. You can feel how comfortable Rashford is at Barcelona.",
      "“As I’ve been telling you for weeks, the feeling internally at Barca is that Rashford really perfectly fits the structure they have on the tactical point of view at Barcelona. They’re very happy with all the relationships Rashford has with his teammates as well.”",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Marcus Rashford got another couple of goals and an assist for Barcelona on Tuesday, and for some that serves as proof he was “lazy” at Man Utd. He can’t win.",
      "Marcus Rashford scored his second Champions League brace of the season against Olympiacos. The Man Utd loanee is loving life at Barcelona.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only."

      "READ: Who are the top scorers of 2025? Gyokeres up to third but miles behind top two",

      "Arsenal and Manchester City-linked forward Rodrygo is the natural choice to be sold, but the prospect of his Brazil and Madrid teammate moving to the Premier League is tantalising.",
      "Vinicius is one of the biggest superstars in football right now and a move to the Premier League wouldn’t just be magnificant for the team he’s joining, but the league as a whole.",
      "Man City are the most realistic option for him, given his wage demands and quality, but he is the perfect signing for a Man Utd side desperate to get back to the top of the football tree.",

      "Man Utd boss Amorim is eager to add a new midfielder after missing out on Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer, and talkSPORT has linked the club with six players, while the less reliable Fichajes says Athletic Bilbao’s Oihan Sancet is also a target.",
      "The Red Devils tried to sign Baleba in August but were put off by Brighton’s £100m valuation. The groundwork has been laid down, though, and they could revisit the Cameroonian in January or at the end of the campaign.",
      "The report from talkSPORT says the Premier League giants want two new midfielders next year as Amorim seeks ‘more pace and athleticism’ in the engine room.",
      "Two midfield additions would be made possible by Bruno Fernandes’ departure next summer, with clubs in Saudi Arabia interested and Man Utd valuing him at around £100m.",
      "Casemiro, meanwhile, is out of contract at the end of 2025/26 and not viewed as a long-term option in midfield. There is a club option to extend his deal for a further year, and even considering his resurgence under Amorim, that wouldn’t be a wise financial decision as the Brazilian earns around £300,000 a week.",
      "Amorim ‘values him highly’ but as everyone is aware, he is severely lacking the ‘pace and athleticism’ required.",
      "With that in mind, coupled with Fernandes and Casemiro’s uncertain futures, several midfielders are being linked with a transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Carlos Baleba – As we are all well aware, Man Utd really like Baleba. Unfortunately for them, Brighton have ‘ruled out’ a winter sale, per talkSPORT. He is the club’s top midfield target and should be one of the sagas of next summer.",
      "Elliot Anderson – Are we looking at the perfect Man Utd signing? Anderson has been outstanding in the Premier League this season, leading the division for passes completed (569), progressive passes (71) and ball recoveries (64). He also ranks third for fouls won (19). He covers the ground required to fit Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has the ability to be the link between defence and midfield, and midfield and attack. talkSPORT says no talks have taken place and Anderson is keen to stay at Nottingham Forest.

      "Conor Gallagher – Another name being relentlessly linked in recent weeks, Gallagher is another perfect fit for a system that requires energy and an all-round game in midfield.  The report adds that Man Utd tried to sign him on loan in the summer, but Atletico would only sanction a permanent sale. He would cost at least £35m and is ‘open to a return to England’.",

It would be fair to quickly disregard Sancet as a midfield target for two reasons: the source and the fact that he’s much more suited to playing behind the striker in Amorim’s front three.

      "Another big ol’ weekend of football on the horizon, and one now dominated by each and every one of us just desperately hoping and praying that Brentford do as they’ve been asked and keep the ball on the ground against poor little Liverpool.",
      "Please, guys, we beg of you. None of those beastly long throws. Liverpool do not like it when the ball is in the air, and the rest of us should definitely respect that.",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United will have to overcome a recent bogey team if they want to take their first ever chance under Ruben Amorim to go on an actual decent little run, Eberechi Eze faces his old club, and Thomas Frank has to find some answers to Spurs’ suddenly soporific attack.",
      "Oh, and there’s quite a big game over in Spain as well. Might be worth a look.",
      "",
      "‘The biggest exception for me was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them — in the last four or five games we’ve played we were not able to press the opponent, because the ball wasn’t on the ground. It was through the air.’",
      "We love absolutely everything about the speed and totality with which Slot has responded to coming under pressure for the very first time as Liverpool manager by dusting off the ol’ Wenger and Klopp playbook and, having considered all the possibilities, come to the conclusion that it is the fault of other teams playing football wrong.",
      "We’d love it even if it were all true. The fact it’s also just absolute mad bollocks only makes it even more delicious.",
      "What we do know, though, is that Liverpool are going to face an aerial bombardment from Brentford this weekend and if they don’t cope with it then it’s all going to look very silly indeed thanks to the manager’s decision to come out and say they don’t like it.",
      "Liverpool are set to face a night of the long throws and, while that was always going to be the case, it now leaves them with no way to save face if they don’t come up with a solution.",
      "Because nobody is going to be interested in further complaints from Liverpool or their manager about opposition tactics.",
      "This was actually a weekend where picking a standout game was actually quite tricky. There’s lots of interesting games, lots of potential, but no clear and obvious blockbuster. So personally, we’re actually quite big fans of Slot’s tactics for making it so much easier for us.",
      "We’ve even resisted the overwhelming temptation to say that Liverpool’s season is at risk of being up in the air but, fair warning, we will absolutely not be able to do so should they come any kind of a cropper at the Gtech.",
      "",
      "Well now. That astonishing ball-in-the-air victory at Anfield has given United the chance to do something they haven’t managed to do at all even once in 11 months under Ruben Amorim: go on a little bit of a run.",
      "They’ve got some okay fixtures coming up over the weeks ahead, but that of course brings its own dangers. Lose at home to Brighton this weekend and all the air goes straight out of the balloon. United go straight back to crisis jail, they do not pass Go, Sir Jim does not collect £200.",
      "And the big problem here is that losing at home to Brighton is precisely the sort of thing Banter Era Manchester United do. Both generally and very, very specifically in this case. Brighton have won on each of their last three Premier League trips to Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost eight times to Brighton in their 16 league meetings, and the trend is one way: in the last four seasons, United have lost six out of eight games against the Seagulls.",
      "It all adds up to the worst possible fixture at the worst possible time in many ways. A fixture that sits precisely in the crisis-restoring sweet-spot of being one United will now be expected to win but recent history suggests they probably won’t.",
      "There’s more to consider here, though, because another thing that’s undeniably true this season is that Brighton only trouble themselves with beating the best. Their three Premier League wins this season have all come against sides who finished in the top five last season.",
      "So if United do lose to them, it’s not a crisis at all but actually proves United are big and good again. Which also means that maybe United shouldn’t win and go on that little run we mentioned earlier, because beating Brighton this season is clear and incontestable evidence that you are no good.",
      "It’s possible we’re overthinking this.",
      "",
      "A fascinating potential battle as Eze faces his former club at the Emirates. The player who got his move from Selhurst Park goes up against Marc Guehi, who very much did not.",
      "It’s a key match-up in a key game, with Palace suffering the most minor of wobbles via defeat at Everton and last-gasp draw against Bournemouth while it already feels like this is a pivotal stage of the season for Arsenal, for whom Palace represent one of the toughest challenges in a run of games that really do offer a captivating chance to open up a significant lead at the top of the table given the far harder challenges that simultaneously face the less convincing Liverpools and Citys of this world.",
      "Eze’s affection for Crystal Palace is deep and obvious, and it’s highly possible that if he were to score this weekend we might see the most muted celebration in Premier League history. Which, in a further twist, are actually the celebrations the Celebration Police should be investigating.",
      "",
      "Nothing is ruined yet, but there has been a sense all season that performances weren’t quite keeping pace with results in Frank’s early games as Spurs manager and now those two lines do seem to be converging.",
      "Spurs were cravenly limp in defeat against Aston Villa last weekend, extending their own dismal home form to a now scarcely creditable three wins in 18 league games while also giving Villa’s also-honking away form a timely boost.",
      "The midweek trip to Monaco produced more of the same, with the only difference being the performance of Guglielmo Vicario. Among the guilty against Villa, he was a hero in the Champions League and almost single-handedly allowed Spurs to burgle a point they absolutely did not deserve.",
      "Spurs have started to look horribly short of attacking ideas, with Plans A, B and C all seeming to amount to not much more than ‘Get the ball to Mohammed Kudus and await him performing a madness’.",
      "He’s been brilliant, and it should absolutely be a prominent element of the Tottenham playbook. But not the only one.",
      "There is a lack of cohesion about Spurs at the moment; this is a new team figuring things out under a new manager and right now it still looks like a bunch of talented individuals rather than a team.",
      "Injuries haven’t helped, for sure. Any one of Dejan Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke or James Maddison would shift the current uncertain and one-note efforts of the non-Kuduses Frank has at his disposal.",
      "But those players have been out for some time and will be out a while longer yet. Neither team nor manager can afford to wait in the hope their returns provide the spark Spurs currently lack.",
      "At least a first trip to the Hill Dickinson Stadium offers a rare chance for Spurs themselves to benefit from the enticing welcome of a stunning new stadium, given the extent to which it seems still to inspire visitors to Spurs’ own spectacular digs.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite the season so far for Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, who remain unbeaten in the Championship and have won their last five league games by a combined aggregate of 16-1.",
      "Mid-table Watford are the visitors to Frank Lampard’s Coventry City in one of this weekend’s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, which gives Frank Lampard’s Coventry City a chance to put some significant scoreboard pressure on their rivals with a victory that would add to the growing sense that we really could see Frank Lampard and his team, Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, in the Premier League next season.",
      "",
      "You can’t ask for much more than a lovely bit of Clasico action, but if you were greedy and decided you did want to ask for more than that, then you’d ask for a Clasico where top spot in La Liga is up for grabs.",
      "Your gluttony sickens and appals us, but you have got your wish. Real Madrid take a two-point lead into this one, so there’s far more than just the standard-issue bragging rights on the line here.",
      "If you still insist on a bit more spice, then how about the fact this game takes place a year to the day after Barcelona won 4-0 at the Bernabeu to lay down an early title marker as well as establishing a dominance that would see them record three further all-competition wins over their old rivals before the season was through?",
      "Memorable wins they were, too, with that 4-0 actually the lowest scoring of the lot. There was a wild Spanish Super Cup clash that ended 5-2 in 10-man Barca’s favour, before more red cards and drama in a 3-2 extra-time Copa Del Rey win and the very best saved for last in the return La Liga fixture, one in which Real Madrid led 2-0 within 15 minutes, but trailed 4-2 by half-time and would eventually lose 4-3 despite Kylian Mbappe completing his hat-trick.",
      "It’s unlikely to be dull, is what we’re saying here.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank feels there is a “very good comparison” between Xavi Simons and Florian Wirtz, with the Spurs and Liverpool new boys struggling – and the stats show ...",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams.",
      "A Tottenham insider has stated it’s “madness” two players have been snubbed by Thomas Frank, after he made an important squad decision recently.",
      "Insider Florian Plettenberg has confirmed that Tottenham are among the teams ‘closely monitoring’ a Brentford forward who scored 14 goals when being managed by now-Spurs boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Former Premier League boss Sam Allardyce has revealed the one “concern” he has about Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season.",
      "Tottenham are reportedly keen on signing a former Real Madrid defender, with Thomas Frank leading the push after his solid start to the season."

      "After achieving their first back-to-back wins under Amorim last weekend, things are looking up for the first time in a long time on the pitch.",
      "Man Utd have still taken just 40 from 35 Premier League matches since Amorim became Red Devils boss but a 2-1 win over defending champions Liverpool marks a step in the right direction.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last season with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund – who scored just seven league goals between them – coming in for a lot of criticism.",
      "Hojlund was sent on loan to Napoli, who are likely to make it into a permanent deal next summer, while Zirkzee has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all arriving at Man Utd in the transfer market.",

      "Amorim has agreed to sanction the winter transfer as Zirkzee ‘will not be part of his long term plans’ after barely playing the forward this term.",
      "The Daily Mirror adds: ‘Zirkzee has fallen down the pecking order, and knows he has to leave United in a bid to revive his flagging career. It’s understood United bosses will listen to offers for Zirkzee in the January transfer window.",
      "‘While another option is for Zirkzee to join another club on-loan for the rest of the season, with a view to making the move permanent. Zirkzee is concerned his lack of first team action will ruin his hopes of going to the World Cup with the Netherlands.’",
      "A reliable account on X first broke the news of West Ham’s interest in Zirkzee with the Hammers making ‘contact’.",
      "The account wrote on Wednesday: ‘Exclusive. @WestHam make move for Joshua Zirkzee. Contact has been made between the clubs. #mufc.’",
      "Before they also revealed on Thursday that Everton were also looking to do a deal, the account added: ‘Exclusive. @Everton along with @WestHam have made enquires for Joshua Zirkzee. This information has been verified from our sources. #mufc.’",

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has commented on a potential Manchester United takeover and has shut down speculation regarding an “approach” to David Beckham.",
      "There has been a lot of change at Man Utd over the past couple of years.",
      "At the start of 2024, the Glazer family sold a 27% stake of the Premier League giants to INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in turn took control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "This deal was worth around £1.25bn and Ratcliffe has since made a further investment to increase his share to around 29%, though he has been heavily criticised over his decisions since joining the club.",
      "Ratcliffe inherited a mess and decided to sanction a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books, though some have argued that certain changes were needless, as there have been mass redundancies, reduced payments to club legends and ticket prices have been hiked.",
      "This means that the British billionaire has quickly become a villain at Man Utd, so recent reports surrounding a potential takeover have been met with positivity.",
      "It has been claimed that an UAE-based consortium are plotting a full takeover of Man Utd and have made ‘approaches’ to several club legends, including David Beckham, over their potential involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh has claimed that a deal is ‘advanced’.",
      "However, Jacobs, who has regularly reported on the Man Utd takeover saga over the past couple of years, has pointed out that Al-Sheikh’s comments were “misleading”, while Beckham is unlikely to be involved.",
      "“So I think now, as is quite widely reported, the interest in buying Manchester United comes predominantly from the UAE,” Jacobs said on the United Stand podcast.",
      "READ: Do Manchester United have the quality to offset ‘the new Ji-sung Park’?",
      "“The group haven’t made any offer to the Glazers. They haven’t even engaged in talks. So it can be simultaneously true that Manchester United are quite in the dark, and yet, there is a consortium out there that is building, and Turki Al-Sheikh tweet got everyone excited.",
      "“The word advanced was misleading. And although the consortium are maybe getting advanced in terms of where their money’s from and what it entails, it’s not advanced between a bidder, and Manchester United, in fact, quite the opposite.",
      "“The Glazers are still waiting to see whether anything actually materialises, and we still don’t know whether they would sell imminently, ie, within the next two years or less.",
      "“But within the UAE, what this consortium, as they build, have done is gone to ex Manchester United legends, including, as I revealed, Eric Cantona are as a possible ambassador, not at investor. We’ve heard David Beckham mentioned as well.”",
      "On the fabricated Beckham reports, he continued: “I have great respect for other journalists, so I’m not here to shout down anyone’s reporting.",
      "“You may recall when I first broke this on talks, but I said a series of ex-Manchester United legends have been approached.",
      "“But I have my doubts about David Beckham, because when Sheik Jassim approached David Beckham, and when Qatar 2022 approached David Beckham, he was willing to do stuff, but only after Qatar won, and only after, and he didn’t Sheikh Jassim won.",
      "“So I’d be surprised if David Beckham considered putting his name or his endorsement to any potential bidder for Manchester United until the point came where they were actually in the club, and then he may be open to some kind of involvement.",
      "Whereas there are other Manchester United legends that would be prepared to endorse a consortium even if it didn’t develop, even if it was just a publicity stunt, even if they never held any talks with the Glazers. So that’s kind of where we’re at the moment. Let’s see whether or not it develops.”",
      "Jacobs later pointed out that Ratcliffe “is not that fearful” about losing power as the takeover situation is “relatively quiet”.",
      "“I think the lines of communication are open enough that Ratcliffe, in agreeing to this sale, including the drag clause, is not that fearful that the Glazers are going to go in the next year or two, definitively in 100%,” Jacobs continued.",
      "“But let’s see if there’s a pathway to a strategic investor, or let’s see whether a consortium just blows the valuation of the Dragon claws out the water, in which case we may have to reconsider the position of all parties.",
      "“But right now, it’s relatively quiet on the takeover front, even though Turki Al-Sheikh got everybody very excited.”",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly left some staff feeling ‘bemused’ as an ‘outburst’ has gone ‘down like a lead balloon’.",
      "The Glazer family are “not really rushing in to sell” Man Utd following claims of a potential bid from a UAE-based consortium, according to reports.",
      "A UAE-based consortium, who are hoping to buy Man Utd, have approached David Beckham over a potential role in the deal, according to reports.",
      "A 38th player has been capped for England while at a foreign club despite having ‘just completely forgot about’ the national team after seven years out.",
      "According to reports, a UAE consortium have had a ‘formal takeover approach rejected’ by Manchester United in the ‘last 24 hours’.",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports."

      "Ji-sung Park is one of the great unsung heroes in Premier League history, but do Manchester United currently have the attacking quality to offset the limited goal contributions of his Old Trafford regen?",
      "After joining United from PSV Eindhoven for just £4m in 2005, Park made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was frequently leaned upon by Sir Alex Ferguson in the toughest fixtures as a reliable 7/10 player in a squad brimming with star talent which would frequently be snubbed in favour of the South Korean.",
      "Park won eight major titles with United, including four Premier Leagues and the Champions League, and Ferguson believes they would have won another had he used the midfielder to man-mark Lionel Messi in the 2011 final.",
      "“That’s where I lost the final against Barcelona at Wembley,” Ferguson said. “I should have changed at half-time and put Ji-Sung Park on Messi. That was a mistake.”",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov were just some of the highly-skilled forwards to have shared the pitch with Park, whose standout attribute was his extraordinary ability to get around the pitch and snap into challenges to win the ball back for United. He was a pressing demon before it became so in vogue.",
      "And the weight of numbers of those he was playing with offset Park’s relatively meagre contributions – he got 19 goals and 23 assists in 154 Premier League appearances across his seven seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha – promising though their starts to life at United have been – offer nothing like the same goals/assists buffer as Ronaldo, Rooney et al. Which begs the question, can Ruben Amorim afford to include the new Ji-sung Park in his starting XI?",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Gary Neville said: “Do you know what I think about [Mason] Mount? He reminds me, say, Darren Anderton or Adam Lallana, Ji-Sung Park, maybe a little bit.",
      "“Players who do that sort of ugly bit well, but they also connect and glue things with, like, he starts the press.”",
      "But Roy Keane doesn’t think Mount is worthy of a place in Amorim’s starting XI, pointing out his poor record in what he believes is his baffling selection.",
      "He said: “That’s a head-scratcher, I think. He’s doing well to get in the starting United team, Mount.",
      "“A lot of managers have loved him over the years, he was the main man with England for a while, Chelsea of course and now obviously the manager wants to put him in.",
      "“But you go back to stats as an attacking player. At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "Mount has scored one goal this season but has managed just two further Premier League goals since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, and remarkably, is yet to provide an assist in his 37 games in the top flight for the Red Devils.",
      "Park’s inclusion could be seen as something of a luxury afforded to Ferguson, made possible by the goal contribution machines he was playing with.",
      "But it’s impossible to know whether those more creative and deadly players would have racked up those numbers without Park scrapping for possession alongside them.",

      "If we use Opta’s xPts model, United would be sitting sixth when it comes to underlying numbers, which would be in line with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s target for the season.",
      "That puts them fifth in our list of the five Premier League clubs whose football suggests they should have more points.",
      "For comparison, Arsenal are exactly where they should be in first place – they clearly are the Premier League’s best side – and Liverpool are in line with their underlying numbers in fourth.",
      "The only other clubs in the ‘correct’ position are Everton and West Ham.",
      "",
      "According to football analytics expert McKay Johns:",
      "In a basic approach, xPts is calculated by simulating each shot in a match.",
      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",
      "So basically, it’s running the game through algorithms and working out the average of how many points should have been garnered from each match according to the xG created and the xG conceded.",
      "As Johns says: ‘The stat does well at giving us a decent idea of how many points a team should get on average, especially over a season.’",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – underperforming by three places",
      "Opta have Manchester United pegged as the sixth best team in the Premier League on underlying numbers. Only Crystal Palace are creating better-quality chances, though the flipside is that only West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Burnley are allowing better-quality chances. They are a curious team.",
      "Of the top 10 players underperforming on their xG in the Premier League this season, three are from Manchester United: Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo and Matheus Cunha, who is yet to get off the mark for the Reds since his transfer from Wolves.",
      "",
      "4) Wolves – underperforming by five places",
      "",
      "3) Crystal Palace – underperforming by six places",
      "We suggested in our manager rankings that perhaps Palace should be doing even better, and the numbers indicate that they are a more rounded side than high-flying Bournemouth. They have the highest xG in the Premier League – and it’s not even close. But then things like this happen…",

      "",
      "2) Leeds United – underperforming by nine places",
      "In terms of xG, they have battered Bournemouth, Tottenham and Burnley in their last three games and emerged with just one point. They are massively missing a ruthless finisher: Brendan Aaronson, Lucas Nmecha, Jack Harrison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin are not that man. Imagine this Leeds side with an Antoine Semenyo or a Thiago…",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United – underperforming by nine places",
      "Defensively brilliant but they have a real problem converting chances (in the Premier League at least), with the weekend defeat to Brighton a case in point. Jacob Murphy and Anthony Gordon are yet to get off the mark in the top flight; there’s only so much Nick Woltemade can do.",

      "There is no control from his midfield where, at Brentford, Dominic Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones, two No 8s, were sat behind Florian Wirtz. They are without the nous to receive the ball from the defence and play forward. Alexis Mac Allister is the answer to that.",

      "Against Fulham after the equaliser that left the game at 1-1, it was Bruno who grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck and shook off any feelings of fatigue from the Champions League in midweek to get his team the points. He broke up play, launched counter attacks and completely shifted the momentum of the game with his tenacity. And when his team needed someone bursting into the box to slam home a rebound, he made that run and got his reward with the winning goal.",

      "Despite showing promise in various phases in the defeat at Newcastle, Fulham were blunt in the key moments. To rack up 47 final third entries and 25 touches in the opposition box at St James' Park is a really healthy number but they simply didn't do enough with their territory.",
      "It's now four defeats on the spin and if the goals don't flow soon, pressure is going to mount. That will test the mental resilience of a squad whose recent seasons have delivered stability, rather than battling survival. This is a season that could easily evolve into a tension-ridden relegation fight rather than a comfortable mid-table campaign.Lewis Jones",
      "Carlos Baleba's form is a concern for Brighton. He has been substituted in all nine of his starts this season, departing just before the hour mark in the Seagulls' chaotic defeat to Manchester United. It has been worse. Three times he has been hooked at the break.",
      "After an improving showing against Newcastle, this was a return to the error-strewn efforts prior to that. Baleba switches off out of possession and looks far too loose in it. He was strongly linked with a move in the summer and does not seem to have settled.",
      "\"It is for the experienced players to get around him, ground him, have a couple of honest conversations because he is going to be a world-class midfield player.\" Still only 21 years old, that is most likely true given the potential that Baleba had shown previously.",
      "But this is an alarming dip in form from him now and the demands of the Premier League wait for no man. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler is trying to play his star midfielder back into form but he cannot wait indefinitely. It is on Baleba to do more.Adam Bate",

      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",

      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",

      "Following a third consecutive victory, Gary Neville believes Manchester United have the pieces in place for a top-six finish. Ruben Amorim has come through his month of reckoning but there are still question marks over Benjamin Sesko after Brighton win...",
      "Saturday 25 October 2025 22:19, UK",
      "Gary Neville has declared this to be Ruben Amorim's best week in the job after Manchester United made it three wins in a row in the Premier League with a 4-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday and believes the template is there for a top-six finish.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club and Bryan Mbeumo added two goals to his total in the second half as United built on their win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",
      "\"If you can keep that back five compact and among them there's some decent defenders, half-decent defenders, that back five can just stay solid and the midfield in front, let them two up front go and do what they do.",
      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"You don't quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet. He's not got up to speed in the pace of it, of how quickly they're playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed.",
      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",
      "\"That's the big job over the next couple of weeks.\"",

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 17:38, UK",
      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
      "It is a mantra that is serving Hurzeler and Brighton well.",
