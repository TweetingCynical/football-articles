      "Cole Palmer grew up idolising Lionel Messi, Wayne Rooney and Eden Hazard. And now Palmer wants to raise his own game after fulfilling his boyhood ambition of getting the No10 shirt with Chelsea.",
      "Palmer, who has worn 20 since arriving at Stamford Bridge two years ago, has yet to ask Mykhailo Mudryk about taking his squad number as the Ukraine winger is facing a four year ban after allegedly failing a drugs test.",
      "But Palmer could not hide his delight at being the main man. “I wore no10 all my life growing up and I just like the number, so yes,” said Palmer. “It’s just an iconic number.",
      "“Messi, the big one, Rooney and players like that. I have seen him [Hazard] a few times at the training ground. He asked me for one of my shirts for his sons, so yes. Idolised him? To see him was nice, we had a conversation, so yes.\"",
      "“I have not spoken to Misha yet but I will when the time is right. It is not really my place to get involved with him at the minute. I will speak to him.”",
      "England star Palmer, 23, is used to taking centre stage as it is his face all over the Club World Cup posters promoting Chelsea’s games as the Blues prepare to face Brazilian giants Flamengo on at Philadelpphia’ Lincoln Financial Field on Friday.",
      "It has been a rapid rise to fame for Palmer after his whirlwind two years at Chelsea which have propelled Palmer to one of the Premier League’s biggest stars.",
      "Palmer said: “It has been quick in terms of how fast it has happened but it is a nice feeling and if I keep performing and keep doing stuff hopefully it will get better and bigger.",
      "“I am just a normal kid so when people do stuff like that I think… ‘why me?’ Obviously in restaurants I get recognised. At the start, it was a bit wow, but now I get used to it. I have not even walked around Philly yet. No, I feel like America is different, they don’t really watch football so it is a bit different.”",
      "Who will win the Club World Cup? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "Palmer is honest in conversation and even admitted after the Europa Conference League final that he provided two assists in the second half - which turned the game around as Chelsea beat Real Betis - because he was bored of playing sideways.",
      "But Palmer was quick to clear up that was not intended as a dig at Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca but, having scored for England in last year’s Euros final, he does relish the big occasions which is why he wants to enjoy the Club World Cup.",
      "He added: “We had a joke about it. My comments weren't towards the manager or anything. I felt like in the game, I was maybe being a bit safe. So that's where the comment came from.",
      "“I feel like I've wanted to play in big occasions from a young age, even in the finals we played when I was younger. I always seem to do something in big games, and since I've come into the first team, it's just continued.”",

      "Sporting CP striker Conrad Harder has offered his thoughts on fellow frontman Viktor Gyokeres’ ongoing transfer saga. Gyokeres, 27, has attracted plenty of attention following his prolific two-year spell in Portugal.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United are each interested in the ex-Coventry City star, who has scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting. And Gyokeres’ future has taken another recent twist after he reportedly rejected the chance to have clear-the-air talks with Sporting. It is claimed that the tension initially stemmed from the club demanding a higher fee than expected after promising to sell him this summer.",
      "It remains to be seen where Gyokeres will be playing his football next season, as Arsenal have also had their attention on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, while United is not seen to be the preferred option for Gyokeres, despite Old Trafford being where his former manager at Sporting, Ruben Amorim, now resides.",
      "However, despite the transfer drama surrounding Gyokeres, it clearly does not concern his Sporting team-mate Harder, who is in fact relishing the chance to take his place next term.",
      "\"Gyokeres? I'm not interested in any news,” Harder told Sport TV, as per Portuguese outlet A Bola. “I am focusing on myself. I want to play. We'll see what happens.",
      "“It's important for me to have minutes now. I was on the bench for a year, and I need to play. I think I'm ready, and we'll see. It will be good to have minutes.",
      "“We will never forget what Viktor did at Sporting. Never! But I hope that the team and I can live up to the challenge. I'll do my best. I think I'm ready.",
      "“I'm not ready to be the new Viktor; he's 27 years old, I'm 20... But I'm prepared to do what I'm best at. And we'll see what I can bring to the team. I want to stay at Sporting.”",
      "Harder spoke after scoring a brace for Denmark in their draw with Finland at the Under-21 Euros on Wednesday. The young forward will hope to keep his place for Denmark’s quarter-final clash with France as he also seeks to prove he can fill the potential void left by Gyokeres at Sporting.",
      "\"I can use this tournament to gain some form. I haven't played that much in the last four or five months, so having game minutes is incredible,” Harder explained. “I think I've already proven to many people that I'm ready to play, but I want to prove a little more that I'm ready to play.”",
      "Harder was forced to be back-up to Gyokeres after arriving from Nordsjaelland last summer, but he made the most of his limited time on the pitch. He ended the season with 13 goals and 10 assists in all competitions, despite only making 21 starts, as Sporting won the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres, who is currently on holiday in Saint Tropez, recently dismissed the noise around his future. Posting on his Instagram story, the striker wrote: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has spoken openly about Gyokeres’ situation. Varandas defended the club’s position and explained that Sporting are yet to receive an offer for their talisman.",
      "“One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me,” Varandas said, as per Portuguese outlet Record. \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",
      "“This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season. During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him.",
      "\"When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.\"",

      "Viktor Gyokeres' agent does not have a ‘signed letter’ from Sporting CP allowing him to leave for a fee less than his release clause, reports in Portugal claim. Gyokeres’ sensational form over the past two seasons has seen Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United both heavily linked with the Swede this summer.",
      "And it has emerged that Gyokeres prefers a move to north London under Mikel Arteta over being reunited with his former boss, Ruben Amorim, at Old Trafford.",
      "But it appears his dream move to Arsenal has hit a stumbling block due to the fee demanded by the Portuguese champions being too high. Reports had stated that the 27-year-old striker would be allowed to leave Sporting for a fee below his £84m release clause.",
      "His agent, Hassan Cetinkaya, claimed he reached a gentleman’s agreement with the club last summer which meant they would accept any offer in the region of £60m (€70m consisting of €60m plus €10m in bonuses), even saying that he had a signed letter to prove it.",
      "However, Sporting’s club president Frederico Varandas has accused Gyokeres' team of trying to 'blackmail' the Portuguese giants into allowing their talisman to leave. The club are therefore holding out for a significantly higher fee which has stalled his potential exit.",
      "And on Wednesday, during a conversation between Luís Aguilar, Marco Caneira and Pedro Henriques on the Jogo Aberto podcast, it was claimed that there was indeed no written document signed by Sporting bosses that obliges the club to accept a lower offer.",
      "Former Sporting defender Caneira said: “Sporting are calm, the agent’s main problem is the contract he has with the player, which is coming to an end.”",
      "Co-host and former Benfica star Henriques added: “Gyokeres’ agent’s strategy only creates chaos and discomfort.”",
      "Meanwhile, Portuguese publication A Bola reports that Cetinkaya’s bold claim actually refers to a clause that allows him to receive 10% of any external offer over £51.3m (€60m), which Sporting rejects.",
      "It also states that the clause isn’t in letter form but in the contract the Sweden international signed in the summer of 2023, following his move from Coventry City.",
      "If that clause is triggered, Sporting will then demand the full £84m release clause in order to let him go – something that is unlikely to sit well with the forward.",
      "Gyokeres has reportedly already threatened to go on strike after vowing to 'speak at the right time.'",
      "According to A Bola, he is 'very upset' with Sporting's current stance and has made his feelings clear to the club's hierarchy.",
      "Arsenal have not put all their eggs in one basket, as a result of the issues surrounding Gyokeres' exit from Sporting. Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig is also being hunted, and the Gunners are looking to see which deal will offer the best value for money.",
      "United, meanwhile, have so far struggled to follow up their signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, as Tottenham's interest in Bryan Mbuemo has seen that move stall.",

      "Marcus Rashford's future at Manchester United remains uncertain for 2025/26 as the summer transfer window reopens. The forward fell out of favour in the Red Devils starting XI when Ruben Amorim arrived at Old Trafford in November after the dismissal of Erik ten Hag.",
      "And as a result, he was sent out on loan to Aston Villa for the second half of the season, writing on Instagram at the time: \"I would like to thank Manchester United and Aston Villa for making this loan deal happen. I was lucky to have a few clubs approach me but Aston Villa was an easy decision - I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions.",
      "\"I just want to play football and am excited to get started. I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best for the rest of the season.\"",
      "While Rashford impressed at Villa Park under the tutelage of Unai Emery - scoring four goals and providing six assists in 17 games - it seems unlikely at present that the club will exercise their £40million option to buy him permanently. As a result, Rashford is set to return to Old Trafford, although it is unlikely that he will work his way back into the team under Amorim.",
      "As he is under contract until 2028, the price will ultimately have to be right for Rashford to be given permission to leave the Red Devils. With an interesting summer transfer window in full effect, here's the latest on Rashford's situation - including all of the teams that he has been linked with a move to ahead of 2025/26...",
      "While Villa hold a £40m option to buy Rashford after his loan spell, they do not hold first refusal on him should another club come and match that offer. Meanwhile, with Rashford looking to find his way back into the England squad under Thomas Tuchel, he will hope to play Champions League football in 2025/26 - something he will not be able to do with the Villains, and as a result, he may choose to give other elite clubs priority.",
      "Meanwhile at the end of the season, Rashford took to Instagram to write a heart-felt message which came across as more of a farewell than an 'I'll see you again soon.' He wrote: \"Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me.",
      "\"It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from 1st minute on the pitch. Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",
      "While it has been reported that Rashford is currently holding out hope for a move to Barcelona, the likelihood of a transfer coming to fruition seems to be getting slimmer by the day. The English international has already reportedly announced that he's willing to take a pay cut from his current £350,000-per-week deal to play for the Catalan giants, however, it appears as though Barca have had their heads turned by other players elsewhere.",
      "It is understood that Barcelona's sporting director, Deco, recently made his way to meet with Athletic Club's Nico Williams after holding talks with the left-winger's agent. It is said that the 22-year-old Spaniard is keen on joining the La Liga giants this summer, and Barca could utilise a relatively cheap £48.1m release clause to secure the star.",
      "With five goals and five assists this season, Williams has proven himself at the highest level of Spanish football - but Barcelona have been warned that they will have to sell players to get a deal over the line due to financial stipulations. La Liga president Javier Tebas recently said of the club: \"They don’t yet meet the requirements to sign freely, they can’t sign yet under the 1:1 rule. If they want Nico, they will have to sell and adjust their accounts a lot.\"",
      "Elsewhere, it is said that Barcelona are also interested in acquiring the services of Liverpool sensation Luis Diaz, who scored 13 goals and provided seven assists this season to excel in the Premier League. However, with a valuation of around £59m at present according to Transfermarkt, a deal may come as a little too rich for Deco's liking.",
      "With regards to Rashford, it is reported that Barcelona would be looking to secure a loan with an option to buy, but if United are only looking for an immediate permanent transfer, he may need to reassess his options.",
      "While Newcastle United are currently content with Alexander Isak up top, it is reported that the Magpies are willing to table an offer to save Rashford from his current tribulations in the north west, as Eddie Howe sees him as the perfect player to rotate with the £160m Swedish star.",
      "Newcastle are reportedly prepared to shell out as much as £40m to secure Rashford this summer, but it is understood that he is likely to reject any advances from the Tyneside-based team as he continues to hold out for a move to Barca. Given that Newcastle managed a fifth-place finish in the Premier League this season, the side will once again compete in the Champions League in 2025/26 - something that may help turn the head of Rashford ever so slightly.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "Manchester United's plan to win the Premier League title by 2028 has been ridiculed by former striker Teddy Sheringham – who branded it “pie in the sky”.",
      "Sheringham also claimed United boss Ruben Amorim will be sacked if he makes a poor start to the new campaign, after ending last season in 15th place – their lowest-ever Premier League finish. Despite that shambolic season, United chief executive Omar Berrada has doubled down on his belief they will lift the Premier League trophy by 2028.",
      "Berrada launched Project 150, the aim of which is for United to win a 21st league title by 2028, the year the club celebrates its 150th anniversary. But after 18 league defeats last season and the failure to secure European football for only the second time in 35 years, Sheringham accused Berrada of living in dreamland with his title claim.",
      "“Omar Berrada’s comments are dreamlike,” said Sheringham. “In football clubs, you’ve got to have small steps to get to places. If you see those small steps and are encouraged and moving in the right direction, that’s when you start looking positively at the future.",
      "“But when people come out with quotes like that, it can be pie in the sky when you’ve got to give the manager time to get things right. For United, the results must improve. It can’t go on like this. The way the talk is – 'it’s alright, we’re gearing for next year, everything is ok for next season'.",
      "“But I think they’re a long way off being anything like the United of old and the pressure will be on Amorim, without a doubt. If he starts the season like the end of last season, there's only one way things will go.”",
      "Sheringham, who scored in United's dramatic 2-1 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999, to clinch the Treble, also said every player should be up for sale – apart from skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“Any player that’s underachieving at United would be surplus to requirements,” said Sheringham. \"And there’s not a lot of players at United who are playing at the top of their form, other than Fernandes.",
      "“So I would think that any offers that come in for anyone playing for United would be very welcome, to be able to get players out and to get others in. Sometimes players fall off a cliff, but I can’t see him [Fernandes] doing that, he’s still got the appetite to go out and do better and lead by example.",
      "“But if Fergie had an offer of £100million for one of his 31-year-old players, going on 32, for the business end of the football club, you’d have to think about things like that.”",
      "Sheringham also said he has sympathy for United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who managed just 10 goals last season, claiming the service provided by his team-mates is simply not good enough.",
      "“We’ve been speaking about Højilund for a good couple of years now,” said Sheringham. “First and foremost, I still think he’s a decent striker, I just think he’s been starved of service at United.",
      "“The way they play, they play with two out and out wingers, no real support apart from Fernandes getting forward. It’s all about the service for centre-forwards and he’s had none. I struggle to think about any striker that you could put in there, that would suffer from the same service and still score goals.",
      "\"You’d have to be some player like Didier Drogba, who did things on his own at times, to score goals. Being a young man as Høljund is and coming into a new country and into the Premier League, trying to understand it, I think he’s had a tough ride.”",

If you look at his style of play, it’s a perfect match with how David Moyes likes to play. While his numbers haven't been great this season, Moyes loves hard workers and that's something you can never complain about in regards to Hojlund.",
      "\"It's not very often David Moyes has had a 20-30 goals-per-season striker. He’s had strikers who run in behind and create space to bring others into play, so, if he's available, Hojlund could be a tempting option for Everton to sign on loan.\"",

      "In the end, the allure of trophies is what swayed Harry Kane to Bayern Munich in the summer of 2023. Throughout his time at Tottenham, Kane was renowned as one the continent's top strikers and was on the radar of every top European club.",
      "In 2021, Kane did everything he could to try and force a move to Manchester City, including publicly stating his desire to leave Spurs during a round of golf with Gary Neville. However, he waited two more years before Bayern forked out £100m to bring him to Bavaria from North London.",
      "While Bayern won the race, Manchester United had been working on a move for the England captain for some time. When Erik ten Hag first took up the reins at United, it was exclusively revealed by the Mirror that he wanted Kane to be one of his first transfer signings. However, it was not the right time for Kane, as he was determined to become Spurs' record goalscorer.",
      "Moreover, if the England skipper was to leave, it would have been for a club that was immediately ready to challenge for the big trophies and not one that was building or in transition.",
      "After overtaking Sir Jimmy Greaves' Spurs tally the following February, United thought they had the perfect opportunity to sign Kane. Spurs finished outside the top four, during a campaign which saw Antonio Conte be sacked by the club, while United had just won the League Cup, reached the FA Cup final and finished third.",
      "Kane had also publicly said that he wanted to overtake Alan Shearer's record of scoring 260 Premier League goals, seemingly ruling out a move abroad. With City enjoying Erling Haaland's services and Liverpool signing Cody Gakpo at the time, a move to United appeared to be the only realistic Premier League move.",
      "It was a more promising situation than 12 months before when Kane was reluctant to move to Old Trafford after United's struggles under Ole Gunnar-Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. The Red Devils finished sixth with their worst points tally for 32 years and had also endured their fifth consecutive campaign without a trophy.",
      "Kane's motivation to leave Tottenham was driven by his desire to win a major trophy. At the time, the North Londoners were seemingly in a better position to win a title than United.",
      "The England frontman had decided that he would only leave Tottenham for a side that's ready to compete for big trophies immediately and not one that was in transition. Kane was impressive in his final campaign at Spurs, but their 8th placed finish meant the writing was on the wall in regard to his future.",
      "Initially, it was reported that Kane's representatives had a \"secret meeting\" with Paris Saint-Germain, who were interested in a move. PSG transfer chief Luis Campos held an \"informal conversation\" over Kane's future, according to Foot Mercato.",
      "At the time, PSG were embarking on a fresh approach to transfers and were in the process of moving Lionel Messi and Neymar on, so they could build a younger and fresher team. A move to the French capital did not suffice and with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy being reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival, Bayern Munich were in the right place at the right time.",
      "When the rumours about a move to Germany were ongoing, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy urged Kane to move to Bayern and plunder as many goals and trophies as possible. In his column for Daily Mail, Murphy said: \"If Bayern Munich come calling this summer, he should go. It would be hugely sad if a player of his quality finished [his career] without winning a trophy. It's something he himself would regret after retirement.\"",
      "He added: \"Going abroad might cost him Alan Shearer's Premier League goals record but, in the grand scheme of things, that shouldn't put him off. In five years, we could be talking about Harry Kane, Champions League winner with multiple Bundesliga titles and cup medals.",
      "\"I'm sure Kane will get other offers. Manchester United have been mentioned, but he hasn't got time to be part of a team that is building. If he was going to leave, it would be primarily to win trophies from the get-go, which would make Bayern his best option.\"",
      "Kane would go on to snub any other interest from United to secure his £100m move to Bayern. After a disappointing first season saw Bayern fail to win a trophy for the first time in a decade, Kane won the Bundesliga under Vincent Kompany, helping himself to 38 goals and 13 assists in 47 matches along the way.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

It looks like he’s turned down Al Hilal… he must be waiting for Man United. I don’t know if Man United are going to come. That’s the problem.\"",
      "Osimhen only has a year left on his deal in Naples which will put his club under pressure to sell as the summer goes on. He has previously been linked with a move to Chelsea, but that never materialised last summer.",

It has already begun following Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival from Wolves, while Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike and Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo remain high on the wishlist.",
      "Yet United have been clear for months that outgoings are a must to fund new arrivals and there is still no clarity on where Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and several others will be playing once the recruitment window closes on September 1. None of those are in head coach Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "Here is the transfer state of play at Old Trafford as things stand.",

He has also axed Sir Alex Ferguson from his ambassadorial role amid the club's perilous financial position.",

      "In a lengthy interview that made the headlines for a comment about his mum being ‘repulsed’ by some of Jude Bellingham’s antics, Thomas Tuchel also spoke about the effect the Club World Cup will have on Manchester City and Chelsea. The tournament in the United States would, he said, result in City and Chelsea being at a ‘huge’ disadvantage in the 2025-26 Premier League campaign.",
      "And the England manager is not the only one to think along those lines. Several times, Enzo Maresca and Pep Guardiola have voiced their major concerns over the physical and mental demands being made on their players.",
      "It might only be the slightest of consolations but perhaps the Premier League fixture schedulers have shown some sympathy for Guardiola and Maresca. Working on the basis that the three promoted teams are ranked 18th, 19th and 20th, the average finishing position from last season of City’s first six opponents next season is 13th (12.8, to be precise).",
      "That figure is 12th (11.67) for Chelsea. Just as significantly, Chelsea do not have to leave London until over a month into the campaign, a home starter against Crystal Palace being followed by a trip to West Ham before a derby with Fulham at Stamford Bridge is followed by a short hop to Brentford.",
      "Of the first six teams faced by both City and Chelsea, only two finished in last season’s Premier League top ten. Arsenal and Manchester United, on the other hand, each have four fixtures against top-ten teams in their opening six matches.",
      "And the average finishing position of their first six opponents last season was eighth (8.17). That represents a decidedly more challenging start for Ruben Amorim and Mikel Arteta - who go up against each other at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the season - than the one faced by Guardiola and Maresca.",
      "In fact, in the context of last season’s form, no team has a harder opening six-game spell than the one in front of United and Arsenal. Normally, this type of imbalance produces two predictable responses.",
      "Firstly, what’s the problem? Everyone has to play everyone twice. The simple answer is that a good start can build momentum while a bad start can undermine confidence. A bad start can cost a manager his job, don’t forget.",
      "A second retort usually involves the old cliche about the Premier League is a competition in which everyone can beat everyone and that there are no easy games in the Premier League. And there is simply no truth in those assertions.",
      "Between them, Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton managed to record only 12 victories from their combined 114 Premier League games last season. Four of those 12 wins came in games against each other.",
      "They had a combined goal difference of minus 153. There ARE easy matches in the Premier League and they normally come against teams promoted from the Championship.",
      "That is why Nottingham Forest fans and manager Nuno Espírito Santo will be satisfied with their schedule as they face two promoted teams in their opening six fixtures. Forest’s start looks as relatively inviting as City’s and Chelsea’s but Maresca and Guardiola will, understandably, remind everyone of their summer workload if it is suggested they have some sort of advantage.",
      "But what is for certain is that the Premier League schedule, by its very nature, cannot be completely fair. And this time, it is Amorim and Arteta who have been dealt the trickiest hands.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Viktor Gyokeres headed into the summer transfer window as a man in demand - but the Sweden star could yet miss out on a dream move to Arsenal after a twist in proceedings.",
      "The Gunners and Manchester United have both been heavily linked with the Sporting Lisbon striker, 27, after watching Gyokeres enjoy another stellar campaign with the Portuguese champions. And it emerged last week that Gyokeres' preference is a move to the Emirates, rather than Old Trafford.",
      "With news breaking in Germany on Wednesday that Arsenal have 'reached an agreement on personal terms' with Sesko, it seems Gyokeres could be the odd man out this summer.",
      "Arsenal's play for Sesko follows reports in Portugal that Real Madrid were offered the former Coventry City man's services. But Los Blancos are in the market for back-up striker, rather than someone who would command a significant first-team role like Gyokeres, and will not be signing him.",
      "It remains to be seen if Gyokeres would reconsider - or be more inclined to negotiate - a move to Manchester United, who have turned their attention to Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike, but are monitoring the possibility of a reunion for Gyokeres and head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils are unable to offer European football, which is thought to be one of the reasons Gyokeres initially favoured a move to Arsenal. But he may eventually end up with little choice, with a number of Gyokeres' supposed preferred options this summer - Liverpool, PSG, Manchester City and Barcelona among them - just not in the market for the Swedish hitman.",
      "And, unfortunately for Gyokeres - and potentially United - there are other elements at play, too: Sporting have refuted claims that the striker is available for less than his release clause, with tensions now at an all-time high.",
      "Record have since claimed that Sporting approached Gyokeres' representatives in a bid to arrange clear the air talks, only for the player and his camp to rebuff them.",
      "Federico Varandas, the Sporting president, has already gone public to take aim at the player's agent and to make it clear that Gyokeres will not be sold on the cheap. He: \"One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "It's a long summer and there are a lot of twists and turns to come. But as it stands, Viktor Gyokeres future is anything but certain - and there is an increasingly more likely scenario where he is left with nowhere to go.",

      "Cox moved to United in 2016 after spells in the academies at Watford and Sheffield United. But he is now set to make the leap to first-team football and would oversee recruitment during an exciting period at Everton.",

      "Having responded to a season that ended on a minus goal difference with four defensive signings last year, Manchester United are redressing the balance this summer after their goal difference became ten times worse.",
      "Matheus Cunha lived up to his number '10' with Wolves last season, tallying 15 Premier League goals. Bryan Mbeumo got five more for Brentford and United are in the market for a new No.9.",
      "Well-placed figures at United spoke about three or four signings before the end of last season. Three of those would go straight into the first team.",
      "A new frontman, Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad and Bruno Fernandes in the same starting XI is an imposing attack. Ruben Amorim will have Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and probably Joshua Zirkzee to call upon as well.",
      "Beyond the three intended attacking additions, the starting XI may otherwise be untouched. United absolutely need an athletic midfielder but they have to get Manuel Ugarte, a considerable investment at £50.75million, up to speed after a patchy first season.",
      "A new signing's maiden campaign can always be couched as one of adaptation. Ugarte was not Erik ten Hag's pick to shore up a porous midfield and United's style under the Dutchman was no different before his eventual defenestration in October.",
      "Ugarte was entrusted by Ruud van Nistelrooy, a fellow fluent Spanish speaker, during his caretaker stint and he started in 28 of his former Sporting coach Amorim's 42 matches in the dugout. Yet Ugarte ended the season behind Casemiro, regarded as a busted flush, in the pecking order and was benched for the Europa League final.",
      "Casemiro's fine form was reserved solely for Europe and he could be redundant in a season comprising only domestic football. Provisionally, Amorim has to reinstall Ugarte with Fernandes as his probable partner in midfield.",
      "Ugarte and Fernandes have started in a midfield two 11 times and United were beaten on only four occasions. Two of those defeats came three days after Europa League knockout ties, a period when United were half-hearted in their weekend fixtures.",
      "Whether United are able to shift Casemiro or not, they require a major reinforcement in the middle third. Mainoo's positioning is largely irrelevant as the alternative is Toby Collyer, whose three starts for the club have come against teams from Scotland, Romania and League One.",
      "United are about to release two over-the-hill centre backs but they do not need another one. United recruited Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven within seven months, Harry Maguire has had his contract extended while Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw could be permanently relocated to centre half.",
      "\"I've enjoyed it,\" Heaven said of his first four months at United. \"It's been tough, the team has really helped me to play my best and I just want to keep going next season.",
      "\"I always try my hardest when I play to impress people and I think I've been doing that. I just want to continue.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez, recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, should return well before the end of the calendar year. The 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson made a decent transition to the first team, albeit in relatively sedate circumstances (and two defeats).",
      "Talking about a lighter workload in relation to Shaw suggests a punchline is imminent. In all seriousness, with a reduced schedule Shaw could possibly hack it as a left winger if he improves his conditioning. United took a relative punt on Patrick Dorgu and it seems inevitable that the left wing will be a position to strengthen next year when Shaw has a year left on his contract (unless a club has taken him off United's hands by then).",
      "Shaw, 30 next month, started five games last season and all of them were at centre back. United lost four and, privately, Amorim must rue picking him in the Europa League final when his form and fitness did not merit that privilege.",
      "United cannot rely on Shaw, who has played in 27 out of 112 matches in the past two seasons. Harry Amass is a sprightlier left winger though there is significant risk in having a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old vying for such a demanding role with Mbeumo pencilled in on the other flank.",
      "Dorgu's first four months were mixed and one assist was a derisory return. It would not have helped that whenever he had the ball and looked up he saw either Rasmus Hojlund or Zirkzee. Dorgu will not be cut any more slack this time next year.",
      "Staff at United speak positively about the Dane's athleticism and his Serie A pedigree. \"It's been tough, challenging,\" Dorgu admitted. \"But I'm happy I played a lot.",
      "\"I think the manager trusts me and I try to help the team, so just happy to be on the pitch and I try to do my best over here.",
      "\"It's a bit different from my old team but I was playing attacking there as well. I just need to adapt to the players and how everyone moves on the pitch.",
      "\"It's obviously different because the fanbase is so massive. A lot of people talk! Everyone is talking about United. It is difficult for young players but I think if you have the right mentality I think everyone can cope with it and it's about performing on the pitch.\"",

He was not as domineering a presence as Paul Pogba during the club's player-power period or indulged as much as Anthony Martial, which made his transgressions under Amorim and Erik ten Hag - after the latter had restored authority to the United manager's role - so disappointing.",
      "After Sir Alex Ferguson did a U-turn and delayed his retirement in 2002, a United player turned to Dwight Yorke, in exile but optimistic ahead of the apparently impending managerial change. \"That's you f*****d, Yorkie.\" Yorke laughed. Rashford knows there is no route back at United with Amorim in charge.",
      "Ten Hag stood up to Cristiano Ronaldo, so Sancho was always going to be small-fry after he publicly accused the Dutchman of lying. Hardly any teammates sympathised with Sancho and urged him to reoncile with Ten Hag. He never did.",
      "Amorim looked bemused when he was incongruously asked in February whether Sancho could have a future at United. \"Jadon Sancho is not my problem.\" He is now.",
      "United need £14.58m to avoid a loss on Sancho under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. It was amusing, for a while, that Chelsea had agreed an obligation to pay up to £25m for Sancho until someone at Stamford Bridge reached for a calculator.",
      "Antony, La Liga-worthy and back in the Brazil squad, has a higher resale value than Sancho but only a handful of clubs would be in the market for the winger and have the financial wherewithal to hit the magic £32.52m mark. Antony has created a market for himself but United may have to tolerate another season-long loan, burnished by a loan fee and an obligation or option to buy.",
      "Of the four forwards in the departures' lounge, Garnacho is the most regrettable. He could not see the wood for the trees in the days leading up to the Europa League final, despite the giveaway that he would be benched when he was named as a substitute five days beforehand at Chelsea. That marked the first time he had been benched for successive games since January.",
      "Garnacho came on at 0-0, defended fecklessly for Marc Cucurella's winner, was rollocked by Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire and still got his hair bleached on the eve of the final. He very deliberately remained on the San Mames pitch, chewing the fat with Sergio Reguilon, as the United team was announced with all of his teammates were in the dressing room.",
      "Most United punters would have started Garnacho against Tottenham. That he didn't does not excuse his post-match petulance. Speaking in his native tongue, he cast doubt on his future.",
      "It felt telling that in the United corporate section for the semi-final at Athletic Bilbao, the only players whose agents were visibly present were Garnacho's and Kobbie Mainoo's. Garnacho's representatives, Enrique de Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro, appear to have been largely useless in advising their client on his social media etiquette. They made everyone aware they were at Chelsea in January when the club considered bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho all but confirmed his bench berth hours before the Europa League final with a passive aggressive post of his FA Cup final goal. He was at it again when United touched down in Manchester after the tempestuous post-season tour. Garnacho uploaded a picture of the Manchester Airport tarmac with the word \"Finally\", accompanied by crying-with-laughter and praying emojis. Whenever he grows up, it will be away from United.",

      "Rashford's working relationship with Solskjaer was not as rosy towards the end and he was particularly dismayed by the handling of his shoulder injury towards the end of the 2020-21 season. Solskjaer also sensed a shift in Rashford's demeanour amid a nationwide love-in over his free school meals campaign.",
      "United could not have foresawn Rashford's form nosediving after a career-best season but there were red flags. An antagonistic story the day after he was benched for the Manchester derby in March 2022, his brother's public dalliance with Paris Saint-Germain and a significant change to his entourage.",

      "In Cunha, United have secured the signature of a specialist No.10 who fits Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation like a glove. He also scored 15 Premier League goals last season.",
      "By signing a player who has already developed a respectable track record for cutting the mustard in England's top tier, United will be hoping he can hit the ground running at the start of next season.",
      "Expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 berth, Cunha will be responsible for creating goals and scoring them. He had a direct hand in 21 goals in 33 league appearances in 2024/25, assisting six in addition to the 15 he netted himself.",
      "Mbeumo, who is being targeted to play as the right-sided No.10, exceeded Cunha's tally by five, helping himself to 20 Premier League goals. Only Liverpool ace Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak of Newcastle United (23) and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (22) got more.",
      "Mbeumo was one of the stars of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, and it is exciting and refreshing to see United in pursuit of one of the division's best players. If he arrives at Old Trafford, he will, just like Cunha, be expected to hit the ground running.",
      "However, neither of them spent last season at a club where the pressure can be comparable with what it is at Old Trafford. That will be a big test of their character.",
      "But with Cunha having made it clear he wanted to join United and no-one else this summer, and Mbeumo prepared to turn down a reunion with Thomas Frank at Tottenham Hotspur in favour of a move to Old Trafford, it says everything you need to know about their hunger to don the famous red shirt.",
      "Securing Mbeumo's signature would send out a real statement of intent. Although he is not the goalscorer United want to fill the No.9 spot, he would be joining them on the back of a 20-goal season, meaning they would expect him to contribute.",
      "United have not had a player score 20 Premier League goals or more in a single campaign since Robin van Persie plundered 26 in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13. A club of United's stature should be able to rely on a 20-goal-a-season man.",
      "Both Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo went close to scoring 20 Premier League goals in a single season in recent years, each falling short by two in 2020/21 and 2021/22 respectively. Marcus Rashford scored 17 league goals when he scored 30 times across all competitions in 2022/23.",
      "If Mbeumo were to join United and get anywhere close to reaching 20 goals next season, he would instantly enter the conversation to be ranked as their best signing post-Ferguson. Just getting into double figures, particularly when he is not an out-and-out centre-forward, would be considered a success for a debut season at Old Trafford.",
      "United need a natural goalscorer this summer to shoulder the attacking burden, but having a player of Mbeumo's quality and capability in front of goal would ease the pressure. The same can be said of Cunha.",
      "With no United player having scored 20 league goals in a campaign for 12 years, Mbeumo would be a significant upgrade on their current attacking options."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Thursday, June 19.",
      "The summer transfer window is in full swing and United supporters are waiting for their club to make their second major signing of pre-season. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is the closest player to joining the Reds with MEN Sport reporting this week that United remain confident about his impending arrival.",
      "A centre-forward will still be needed in the summer and United have been linked to plenty of options. Legendary centre-back Rio Ferdinand has demanded that his old club target Victor Osimhen and he is one of the names linked with Old Trafford.",

      "Man United have reportedly launched a bid in excess of £60m for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Duncan Castles has claimed that United have submitted a better offer after seeing a bid worth £55m plus add-ons rejected. The journalist has claimed that Brentford will do everything they can to get £70m for the forward.",
      "Manchester United could reportedly be set to receive a significant financial boost following confirmation that beIN Media Group has secured exclusive rights to broadcast every Premier League match across 24 countries.",
      "The Qatar-based company will broadcast every Premier League match across 24 countries in the Middle East and North Africa until the end of the 2027/28 season. Discussing how much United will benefit from the deal, our Chief Business of Football Writer Dave Powell told MEN Sport: \"For the Premier League and its shareholders, which are the 20 clubs which hold membership, keeping the positive momentum around broadcast rights is vitally important.",
      "\"Throughout the 2010s the acceleration in the value of broadcast rights domestically and internationally allowed for the Premier League to hand far more money over to its clubs, and that afforded the clubs the opportunity to go out and spend more on transfer fees and wages than other major leagues such as Spain’s La Liga, the German Bundesliga, and Italy’s Serie A.\"",

      "The saga surrounding Gyokeres feels eerily similar to the disaster that unfolded with De Jong in Ten Hag's summer so maybe now is the time to pivot their attention.",
      "It feels like Osimhen has been almost forgotten this summer so maybe United have the chance to swoop in ahead of their rivals.",
      "According to The Athletic, Barcelona have reached personal terms with Athletic Club's Nico Williams and do not see his £50m release clause as a barrier towards getting the deal done.",
      "That news is a hammer blow for Rashford who has been dreaming of a move to Camp Nou as his time at United looks to be at an end.",
      "With Williams on the way to signing, it now looks increasingly unlikely that the La Liga club will move for Rashford as well or, at the very least, he will not be seen as a priority.",
      "According to talkSPORT's Alex Crook, Gyokeres has told family and friends that he is expecting to join Arsenal in the transfer window.",
      "It is claimed that while he has a pre-existing relationship with Amorim, the desire to play in the Champions League is edging him towards north London.",

      "The Guardian understands that the Reds are keeping an eye on West Ham forward Mohammed Kudus this summer.",
      "Kudus arrived at the Hammers in August 2023 and after a good debut campaign endured a difficult second season in East London.",
      "West Ham have inserted a release clause of £85m in Kudus' contract which is perhaps more than United or any of their Premier League rivals would be willing to pay.",
      "While Newcastle have reportedly thrown their hats into the ring for Rashford, it appears the winger is not yet willing to give up on his dream of signing for Barcelona.",
      "According to Marca, Rashford is willing to present himself as the cheaper option to Barca than their other targets Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "In doing so, Rashford is reportedly willing to do things within his control to push through a move to Camp Nou this summer.",
      "The Sun understands that Newcastle have joined the race to sign Marcus Rashford this summer from United.",
      "It is thought Eddie Howe's side are confident they can provide the right platform for Rashford to rebuild his career.",
      "Their offer of Champions League football could also entice him but a move to Barcelona has been at the top of Rashford's wishlist for some time now.",
      "Former Manchester City and Villa centre-back Joleon Lescott believes that the West Midlands club will be able to find a replacement for Emi Martinez should he choose to sign for United this summer.",
      "Speaking to Betway, Lescott explained:",
      "I don’t want to sound disrespectful, but I think they can replace him. I think they have a strong enough team and style, and I think Unai Emery’s proven that. They haven’t missed any player, really, they’ve been able to rotate, add, take away, suffer injuries. Martinez is top, very, very good, but I think if they acquire someone with experience, I think that’s key – the experience of who comes in to play that position, because they’re still relatively young at the back. That experience can add an amount of calm. I think it’s a loss, 100 per cent, but I don’t think it derails them where there’s question marks asked about whether they can achieve similar things to this season.",
      "A new twist in the Emi Martinez saga unfolded last night when it was reported by GiveMeSport that the Aston Villa goalkeeper had offered his services to United this summer.",
      "It is thought that Villa would be reluctant to see the Argentine leave their club but are wary of potentially breaching profit and sustainability rules if they do not sell him.",
      "United would need to pay approximately £40m to sign the ex-Arsenal shot stopper.",
      "One minute they were in for him, the next they are out - now there are claims that the Saudi club are back in the race for Osimhen.",
      "This transfer window hokey cokey can be very confusing but, at the moment, reputable sources understand that Osimhen does not favour a move to the Middle East.",
      "When sent the previous lucrative offer from Al Hilal prior to the Club World Cup, it's believed the striker rejected it because he still holds a desire to play in Europe.",
      "Despite this clear setback towards United's hopes of signing Osimhen, Ferdinand is still pushing to bring the Nigerian to Old Trafford.",
      "On his namesake podcast this week, Ferdinand renewed his calls to bring in the striker",
      "No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen! It looks like he’s turned down Al-Hilal… he must be waiting for Manchester United. I don’t know if Manchester United are going to come. That’s the problem.",
      "Malaysian media outlet Sabah understands that Osimhen is not currently interested in moving to either United or Arsenal this summer but has kept the door open for Chelsea.",
      "It is claimed that Galatasaray and Al Hilal are still frontrunners for his signature having both offered him lucrative salaries.",
      "The Istanbul club are reportedly willing to pay him £12.8m per year with £8.5m available in add-ons while the Saudi Pro League club are believed to be willing to spend £42.6m on his annual salary.",
      "While these offers blow United and Arsenal out of the water, it is believed the Nigerian has remained in talks with Chelsea regarding a potential deal.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and hopefully you managed to get some sleep in the UK as we truly settle into this heatwave.",
      "If you didn't, don't worry as we have plenty of United news to come today to keep you feeling awake and reinvigorated on this Thursday morning.",
      "To kick things off, we shall begin by looking at the latest surrounding this man...",
      "That is everything from us tonight, thank you for joining us.",

      "Manchester United's transfer business is the talk of the fanbase at the moment, with the inventory of goal-scoring profiles available - and good enough - seemingly being shortened.",
      "It's plausible that United will end the summer transfer window with three attacking additions. Ruben Amorim's fluid 3-4-2-1 system is heavy on the three forward players, and last season, United didn't get the right balance.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored 10 goals in all competitions, and Joshua Zirkzee managed less. Alejandro Garnacho's occasional moments of magic came in glimpses. Bruno Fernandes scored 19 goals playing in both defensive and offensive midfielder roles and Amad, when not injured, scored 11 and assisted a further 10.",
      "Work has already started in handing Amorim the tools to get the most out of his forward three. Matheus Cunha, who scored more Premier League goals than any other United player last season, is already at the club after the club triggered his £62.5million release clause.",
      "A player who scored five more goals than Cunha is Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford star appears to be the current priority for United to give Amorim two superb options behind the striker.",
      "It's understood that the 25-year-old wants to move to Old Trafford despite interest from Thomas Frank's Tottenham. A bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons has already been rebuffed, and Omar Berrada has already revealed the club's stance on being speedy in negotiations.",
      "\"We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" he told United We Stand. \"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money.",
      "\"So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "On the face of it, United are taking their time in getting the deal over the line. The lack of European football and the club's worst season in 51 years mean United aren't at the luxury of paying over the odds to sign players.",
      "Once Mbeumo is signed, player sales will be a priority before a new striker is targeted with Viktor Gyokeres on their radar. Right now, United have time to negotiate the proper deal, but there's a deadline for Amorim to get his players in order.",
      "United kick-off their pre-season schedule on July 19 against Leeds United in Sweden, meaning the start date of training is expected at the start of July. Amorim's players will then travel to the United States to participate in the Premier League Summer Series, where they'll face West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Last year, Erik ten Hag and his squad played out a similar schedule, with games against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool all taking place between July 27 and August 3. 12 months ago, United travelled stateside on July 24, three days before their first fixture against Arsenal.",
      "That would point towards United leaving Manchester for their tour on July 23. In an ideal world, United will have their three attacking reinforcements on that plane to the USA to ensure the best preparation for the new season.",
      "Under Ten Hag, only Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee were part of the pre-season squad. Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui both joined three days before the first game of the season, and Manuel Ugarte's arrival came after three games.",
      "Despite not being part of the preparations for the season, Mazraoui, De Ligt and Ugarte all played more minutes than Yoro and Zirkzee.",
      "It ended up costing Ten Hag and United's season. It can't happen this time around. United know they have to get the players in before they jet off to the United States."

      "Manchester United could reportedly be set to receive a significant financial boost following confirmation that beIN Media Group has secured exclusive rights to broadcast every Premier League match across 24 countries.",
      "The Qatar-based company will broadcast every Premier League match across 24 countries in the Middle East and North Africa until the end of the 2027/28 season. As a result, fans will be able to watch all 380 games each season live in both Arabic and English.",
      "In addition to live coverage, fans will have access to comprehensive magazine-style programming, including pre- and post-match shows, daily highlights, and weekly wrap-up programmes.",
      "Paul Molnar, Chief Media Officer of the Premier League, said: \"We are delighted to announce the extension of our longstanding partnership with beIN MEDIA GROUP for a further three seasons in MENA. This renewal reflects our shared commitment to delivering world-class football and providing the best possible, localised viewing experience. We look forward to continuing our close collaboration on a variety of content and promotional initiatives, bringing the Premier League even closer to our passionate fans in this important region.\"",
      "Discussing how much United will benefit from the deal, our Chief Business of Football Writer Dave Powell told MEN Sport: \"For the Premier League and its shareholders, which are the 20 clubs which hold membership, keeping the positive momentum around broadcast rights is vitally important. Throughout the 2010s the acceleration in the value of broadcast rights domestically and internationally allowed for the Premier League to hand far more money over to its clubs, and that afforded the clubs the opportunity to go out and spend more on transfer fees and wages than other major leagues such as Spain’s La Liga, the German Bundesliga, and Italy’s Serie A.",
      "\"The growth has slowed in recent seasons, though, and while the £6.7bn domestic deal, up from £5bn, may have been trumpeted as a major success, it was for four years and not three, and gave away 70 more live games per season. On a per-game basis that is actually a diminution in value. Piracy has been a worry for clubs, with it impacting subscriptions, which in turn impacts the amount of value that broadcasters put on becoming the rights holder. That, allied with the fact the deal struck during the pandemic retained the status quo, a win at the time, means that the growth has not been on the trajectory it was. We are now seeing a plateau in terms of domestic rights.",
      "\"But international rights have proven to be different. The Premier League remains bullish on the prospects of the next few international cycles growing in value, and the rise in the value of the Middle East deal with beIN Sports backs that up. It is up 10% over the next three-year cycle at £550m, and with positive hopes for China’s next deal, as well as the United States, the £12.25bn figure is likely going to increase further.",
      "\"That is important for clubs. At the end of each and every season, ahead of the start of a new campaign, clubs get their share of the lucrative money pot. An equal share of £31.2m from the domestic rights, and £55.7m from the international rights, is added to by facilities fees, which is how many times teams feature on live UK television broadcasts, as well as merit payments that are handed out on a sliding scale based on competitive success. There is also a flat commercial fee that clubs are the beneficiary of.",
      "\"An increase in the international rights points to a positive trend, and that will give club owners greater confidence over future revenue strength. For some time now, club owners have been looking to reduce their reliance on broadcast revenues and raise other revenue pillars such as commercial and matchday. There will be extra millions for Premier League teams as a result of the beIN deal, and while it won’t be sums that change the summer plans, it does point to the continued strength of the league, and that will mean greater investor confidence, which means more money will likely flow into the league, with the lion’s share still to come from the United States.",
      "\"The Premier League remains a premium product for broadcasters and is still the biggest driver of subscribers to their platforms. The Premier League’s clubs rely on a strong broadcast deal at home and abroad to a significant degree. A rise in the Middle East deal will deliver greater confidence, and spending on new talent and payroll will continue to rise.\""

      "Twelve months down the line and United have zero complaints. After missing the first five months of the season, due to an injury picked up in pre-season, Yoro subsequently wrestled his way into Ruben Amorim's plans.",

      "Attacking reinforcements are now the priority for United with Matheus Cunha already being snapped up. However, Lindelof's exit has created minor speculation that a new central defender might be considered as the window goes on.",
      "In spite of that, Branthwaite won't be coming to Old Trafford. The 22-year-old, who was valued between £70million and £80million by Everton, is understood to be in talks to commit his future at Goodison Park.",
      "Everton are facing a squad overhaul this summer, with the likes of Seamus Coleman, Michael Keane, Idrissa Gueye and Dominic Calvert-Lewin all yet to resolve their future. It's said that Moyes wants to protect his defensive trio of Branthwaite, James Tarkowski and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.",
      "Tottenham are said to hold interest in Branthwaite this summer, but no move has been made as of yet. Other centre-backs have been linked with United; including Evan Ndicka, Goncalo Inacio, Aymeric Laporte and Yann Bisseck."

      "After Omar Berrada declared Manchester United would go in search of versatile players this summer, it is easy to understand why Bryan Mbeumo currently sits top of their wish list.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves earlier this month, United have earmarked Brentford star Mbeumo as their next target to go after in this summer's window.",
      "Despite seeing an opening offer worth £55million knocked back a fortnight ago, United are understood to still be in talks with Brentford over a deal. Furthermore, Mbeumo is just as keen to get a deal over the line.",
      "It is thought Brentford are holding out for a fee similar to the one United paid Wolves to sign Cunha (£62.5m), although he was attainable via a release clause. That made the deal relatively straightforward to get done.",
      "Despite interest from Tottenham Hotspur, who recently appointed former Brentford chief Thomas Frank as their new boss, Mbeumo has told confidants that he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer. It is players of his character and mentality United need.",
      "Mbeumo enjoyed a stellar 2024/25 campaign, scoring 20 Premier League goals, meaning his stock is at an all-time high. He would boost United's chances of increasing their attacking output and would offer a sense of the versatility Berrada believes United need.",
      "Mbeumo, if signed, would be able to operate as a right wing-back, a right-sided No.10 and potentially as a striker. He would tick plenty of boxes.",
      "But with United keen to move at speed this summer, in terms of securing incomings and overseeing outgoings, they may have to keep other options in mind if talks over Mbeumo do not progress as quickly as they would like them to.",
      "According to a report by The Guardian, United have expressed interest in West Ham United ace Mohammed Kudus. It is claimed United, Chelsea, Newcastle United and another unnamed Premier League club are keen on his signature.",
      "It has been widely reported in recent weeks the Ghanaian wants to leave West Ham this summer and open a new chapter. Despite links with a move to Saudi Arabia, he is not keen on a move to that part of the world at this stage in his career.",
      "Kudus has an £85m release clause in his Hammers contact that will reportedly become active for Premier League clubs for the first ten days of July. However, the Hammers are keen to cut their cloth this summer and raise funds via player sales, meaning they may be prepared to negotiate a lower selling price.",
      "A £65m fee has been mooted and that would represent a more realistic valuation of the 24-year-old, who was on United's radar back in 2022 when at Ajax. Despite not scoring 20 goals like Mbeumo did in 2024/25, Kudus has a lot of similar characteristics.",
      "Just like the Brentford ace, he is extremely versatile and likes to drift into central positions when tasked with starting out wide. He has pace, power and the ability to make something happen in the blink of an eye.",
      "Although his second season in England was nowhere near as fruitful as his first, which produced 14 goals and nine assists, he is still a player of great quality. Admitting he prefers to play as a No.10, he would be a tailor-made fit for Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Mbeumo ought to remain United's priority target in their search for a right-sided option, but Kudus should be considered as an alternative option if a deal for the former cannot be reached. However, the Reds are unlikely to entertain Kudus' £85m release clause."

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford could be on the verge of missing out on a move to Barcelona this summer after the Catalan club took a step closer to signing another winger.",
      "For the past few weeks and months it has been reported extensively that Rashford sees a transfer to Barcelona as a 'dream' move for him. This week, it was claimed that Rashford was willing to take a salary cut to persuade Barca that he should be signed.",
      "However, the Catalan club were still unsure about United's asking price and were therefore hesitant to make a formal approach. Now, it seems like Rashford is the furthest he has ever been from a move to Camp Nou.",
      "According to The Athletic, Barcelona have reached personal terms with Athletic Club winger Nico Williams and are edging closer to a formal agreement and, eventually, an official announcement. It is claimed that Barcelona do not see Williams' £50m release clause as an issue that would hinder a deal and are ready to pull the trigger on his signing.",
      "The only hold up that could present an issue for Barca is the fact that they are currently making sure they have enough room in their salary budget to allow Williams to sign up. While the Catalan club have managed to save some money on their wage bill after allowing Clement Lenglet to leave for Atletico Madrid after terminating his contract, selling Alex Valle to Como and bringing in £6.6m in from a sell-on clause attached to Jean-Clair Todibo's move from Nice to West Ham, they still need to do more.",
      "Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garcia is currently waiting to be registered after joining this week, and until they clear even more headroom for themselves, Williams is unlikely to be confirmed. Sadly for Rashford, it is expected that Barca will be able to free up their wage bill to bring in Garcia and Williams, but currently there is no indication that there will be enough room spared for the United academy graduate."

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking, followed by the disappointing interim period under Ralf Rangnick, had left the club wallowing in... sixth position. After the 2024/2025 season such a league position would be lauded as a triumph next year but, at the time, it was seen as well below-par with United far off the race for Champions League football.",
      "However, there was hope that things were going to change for the better with the arrival of Erik ten Hag. He had done well with Ajax and was seen as a manager that broke away from the old guard choices which didn't seem to help progress the club.",
      "After being sucked into a Frenkie de Jong transfer saga, that absorbed much of the window, United showed their commitment to backing Ten Hag by investing a cool £86m on Antony. Sadly, this move never worked out for the Reds with the Brazilian soon shifted out of the club on loan when the Dutchman was eventually sacked in October 2024.",
      "A year after Antony made his switch to Old Trafford, the deal that United should have made in 2022 was in turn completed by West Ham as they welcomed Mohammed Kudus to east London. In his first season, while Antony floundered, Kudus soared as he bagged 14 goals and nine assists in all competitions.",
      "At this stage, it was clear that Kudus was a better investment, at that time, and would have cost significantly less at £38m. Fast forward to 2025 and now the Ghanaian has had a difficult season, United are looking at the prospect of signing him, at least according to The Guardian.",
      "Despite his underwhelming 2024/2025 campaign, the Iron are still looking at the potential to snap-up their £85m release clause from an unknowing Premier League club desperate to make their mark. United now have the opportunity to sanction the deal that should have been done in 2022, but it does not mean they should now.",
      "Kudus is way out of their price range now and his returns in the Premier League simply do not justify the current price tag that West Ham are demanding. This is a deal best left in the past and that money needed to activate his release might well be better served elsewhere."

There he was able to make an impact with four goals and six assists in 17 matches, thus reinforcing the message that perhaps his future lies anywhere besides this new dawn at Old Trafford.",
      "Villa had a £40m option to make their loan permanent but did not act on it, meaning it will fall on United to find a different club to sell to if this summer is going to produce the definitive parting of ways.",
      "Sporting director Deco has even told Catalan radio station RAC1 last month: \"We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players.\"",
      "It just so turns out as that situation has developed, it is one of those 'other players' that the La Liga side may progress towards signing instead of the United forward. Athletic Bilbao prospect and Spanish international Nico Williams appears to have emerged as their new top target, personally vying for the move.",
      "In a new update from Marca, Rashford is apparently not going to give up on his dream move to Barca whilst there is still a fighting chance.",
      "They say he is eager to become Barca player at the end of this saga and claim he is willing to supplement the fact that his price tag would likely be smaller than Williams' by making 'sacrifices', including those financially.",
      "That appears to a be a hint towards the England attacker slashing his wage demands in order to appear a more attractive option over the Bilbao and Liverpool options.",
      "Rashford, 27, earns £325,000-a-week at United and his salary has so far prevented him from leaving the club having previously outlined his desire for a \"new challenge\".",
      "As the saga over his future goes on, Rashford has already shown his commitment to being in the best possible shape ahead of the 2025/26 season, even if it is uncertain which club he will be playing for.",
      "He shared his training regime to his Instagram followers, showing that between Monday, June 9 and this coming Sunday, June 22, he will have had only three days off where he has not worked out in some capacity. Nine days were dedicated to gym sessions and on the pitch while two further days will be focused solely in the gym.",

      "However, landing the statement striker they are in such desperate need of is not going to be an easy or straightforward task.",
      "United are also dependent on player sales to raise cash to fund new additions. If they sign Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m, they will then be reliant on departures to strengthen other areas of the squad.",
      "There is an obvious need for a midfielder and a goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana, but recruiting an established No.9 has to take priority. United scored just 44 league goals last season and have finished the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Having been without Zirkzee, despite him turning out not to be a No.9, on last summer's tour, and Rasmus Hojlund arriving after the tour the previous year, United can ill-afford to go another pre-season campaign without a recognised No.9 in their ranks.",
      "Amorim would love to be able to take his new starting striker to the US with him and give him the opportunity to get used to his new teammates, learn the system and attempt to settle himself in before the competitive action starts against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "But for that ambition to become a reality, United are going to have to identify their top target to spearhead their attack and step up their efforts in the market to fund his arrival. Neither are impossible tasks, but the countdown is most definitely on."

The following week, Unai Emery insisted at Old Trafford that Martinez would not be playing his last game for Villa against United.",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Liverpool\nApparently, Liverpool were looking to offer Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa to Napoli in exchange for the Nigeria striker. Which actually makes sense. We know Napoli like Nunez, who would either be a huge hit or a massive flop in Naples – there’s no middle ground. That could still happen, but more likely now as a stand-alone deal. If Liverpool are going big for a striker, it could be this fella.",

      "",
      "18) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nApparently, Napoli have £45million to spend on a left winger, with Grealish and Alejandro Garnacho in the frame. City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "15) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’. But they don’t want to pay for him – yet. Of course United want a permanent sale but the chances are the best they might get is a loan with an obligation.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Rodrigo Muniz – Fulham to Leeds\nLeeds have gone hard for Muniz – but not hard enough. Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse. One Leeds would be daft to make.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",

      "",
      "9) 🔼 Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for £30m.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United but then Frank’s appointment gave Spurs renewed hope. United remained confident of getting their man, but decisive action appears scarce. They were expected to make a second offer to Brentford a week ago, but we know not how much or if it was ever submitted.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. There was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Everyone reckons it’s done. So why the wait? Zubimendi is in the middle of three-week FIFA-mandated holiday, while reports suggest both clubs would prefer for the deal to go through the books in July.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nThis seemed to be done, but now we are told that Liverpool and Bournemouth ‘remain in talks’. Given the Cherries have signed a replacement, we presume it’s the very fine details being discussed and Kerkez will be heading to Anfield imminently.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",

      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s essentially no chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",

      "",
      "17) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "15) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "14) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nSee Marco Silva.",
      "",
      "13) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "12) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "10) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "Dunno, so it’s into mid-table Maresca must slot. He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of this list but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "What you may notice we’ve cleverly avoided here is any attempt at predicting what we actually think Man United will actually do next season in terms of being good/bad/indifferent. And that’s because we genuinely have not one clue. Could be anything, couldn’t they?",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, but again, that doesn’t really matter for our purposes. Arteta’s is a quirky situation where the range of possible outcomes is such that he sits uncommonly prominently in this list but would be even closer to the top of any possible manager of the year list.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "5) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games, Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo. There’s also the added early-season headache of those Conference League qualifiers, too, which none of our other European entrants have to worry themselves with.",
      "",
      "4) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack. As with Arteta – perhaps even more so – what we’re doing here isn’t quite as straightforward as ‘do you think this manager will do well or what’.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "1) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have been dealt a major blow as head coach Mikel Arteta is ‘set’ to lose a key member of his staff in a ‘record’ deal.",

      "He explained: “He’s one of the few strikers in the game who looks like a real, out-and-out No. 9. He’s tall, he’s quick, and he’s strong for a big man. He’s really good technically and he scores goals. Lots of them.",
      "“With his age, you’d think the ceiling would be pretty high in terms of improvement. He’s got good pedigree in the Bundesliga and he did the business when he was given an opportunity in the Champions League, so those are good signs for Arsenal.",

      "The Manchester City manager had lied equally absurdly a month or so before, stating that “because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season”.",
      "Haaland arrived in a £200m package soon after and is now within five places of Aguero on the club’s all-time top scorer list after just three seasons. Although it somehow remains unclear whether Manchester City are better without a Proper Striker or not.",

      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",
      "Yet Van Nistelrooy left with just one Premier League title, an FA Cup and a League Cup, matched with the solitary Golden Boot he managed to snatch away from arch-nemesis Thierry Henry.",

      "8) Freddie Ljungberg\nArsene Wenger felt compelled to make an exception for Ljungberg, a player he had never seen in person before sanctioning his purchase from Halmstad in 1998.",
      "“I saw Freddie Ljungberg giving a hell of a lot of problems to Martin Keown while watching him on television as he played for Sweden against England. I decided to buy him then,” the legendary Arsenal manager once said of a Euro 2000 qualifier in which Keown categorically did not feature.",
      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",
      "",
      "5) Ashley Cole\nBy the time Cole left Chelsea for Roma after winning seven trophies in eight years, the pawn in the controversial move which saw him swap a fading force for one just establishing itself was retiring from the game completely.",
      "Arsenal wanted £25m for their starting left-back at the start of summer 2006; they eventually relented and settled for £5m plus William Gallas.",
      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off. They certainly benefited from a situation of their own making with Cole, whose bridges back to Arsenal had been summarily torched, but still.",

      "4) David de Gea\nIt might not be entirely accurate but it does feel as though De Gea single-handedly prevented Manchester United from enduring as catastrophic a season as their most recent on multiple occasions over a 12-year tenure.",
      "He was the original Bruno Fernandes, a tangibly better player than most if not all his teammates yet bizarrely keen to sacrifice the best years of his career to a failing institution. Once that fax machine faltered in 2015 it seemed as though De Gea just accepted his fate as a Manchester United lifer.",
      "The club never was going to show that same loyalty as soon as the Spaniard became dispensable and their handling of his exit was amateurish. But there was a time – after a rough initiation period – when Manchester United almost accidentally possessed the finest keeper in the world.",
      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",

      "If Blackburn had filed their paperwork properly and Dalglish not taken a sunny July weekend off in 1993, the first Premier League crown under Ferguson might have been marked by no Manchester United incomings whatsoever. But it opened the door to a record-breaking hijack which shaped the club’s future and heralded a glittering and often contemptuous spell.",
      "Keane won a dozen trophies and two Player of the Year awards at Old Trafford, committing to history one of the most iconic individual performances the sport has seen, inspiring the introduction of the prawn sandwich brigade to the game’s lexicon and forlornly challenging the ego of Rio Ferdinand.",

      "​​Mykhailo Mudryk could face a doping ban of up to four years after he was charged by the FA but he is not the first footballer to be hit with a stint on the sidelines.",
      "While it may be hard to imagine if you ever saw Mudryk play for Chelsea, the Ukrainian was in fact using the performance-enhancing drug meldonium, which helps with the body’s cardiac functions.",
      "The Ukrainian first pinged the FA’s anti-doping tests in December before his second sample also came back positive and while he waits to see how long he could be out of action for, we’ve taken a look through the annals of football history to find which other players have been caught doping…",
      "",
      "Kicking us off is former Ajax, Barcelona, Milan, Juventus and Inter midfielder turned unlikely Barnet manager Edgar Davids.",
      "Football’s most famous glasses-wearer was plying his trade in Turin for Juve in the 2000/01 season but was hit with an extended period on the sidelines after failing a drugs test.",
      "Davids, along with Lazio defender Fernando Couto, tested positive for the steroid nandrolone, and the Dutchman was initially given a five-month ban. Davids appealed the decision, maintaining his innocence, and his suspension was reduced to four months.",
      "Davids was the eighth player in Serie A to test positive in that season alone.",
      "2001 was not a great year for the Dutch FA as not only did Davids fail a drugs test, Jaap Stam did too.",
      "In an almost carbon copy of Davids’ case, Stam was playing in Serie A and was also found guilty of taking nandrolone.",
      "The former Manchester United defender was at Lazio and was perhaps lucky to avoid a longer ban after the Italian Olympic Committee suggested an eight-month absence, a recommendation rejected by the Italian FA.",
      "",
      "The off-field life of Kolo Toure can sometimes feel like it was written by a misfiring AI but when he was not pretending to be a used car salesman so he could pull women, the Ivorian was getting into trouble with doping control.",
      "In May 2011 and while at Manchester City, Toure was banned for six months after testing positive for an unspecified substance.",
      "How did he come into contact with the outlawed drug? Simple, he took some of his wife’s diet pills.",
      "That reasoning satisfied the FA commission chairman, who ruled that Toure did not intend to enhance his performance, meaning he received a more lenient ban.",
      "The back-dated six-month suspension began in March as Toure became the first Premier League player since 2004 to be caught doping.",
      "Given Adrian Mutu had already been at five clubs by the age of 24, Chelsea should perhaps have wondered if signing the Romanian was a good idea.",
      "The answer to that became an emphatic ‘no’ in September 2004 when he tested positive for cocaine.",
      "But despite being given a seven-month ban by the FA, his biggest punishment actually came from the club as Chelsea took Mutu to court, arguing he had broken the terms of his contract.",
      "A committee ruled in Chelsea’s favour and after three years of courtroom back and forth, the FIFA Dispute Resolution ordered Mutu to pay Chelsea back his transfer fee.",
      "A €17,173,990 bill landed on the Romanian’s doorstep and try as he might to overturn it – including a 2018 appeal to the European Court of Human Rights – Mutu could not get out of it.",
      "One of the most famous doping cases in English football came at the country’s biggest club with controversy surrounding Manchester United.",
      "On the morning of September 23, 2003, a training session had just finished at United’s Carrington headquarters when a representative of UK Sport arrived for a routine drugs test.",
      "Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and John O’Shea were all randomly selected, as was Rio Ferdinand, but the defender was nowhere to be seen.",
      "Ferdinand had already headed home and his excuse for missing it? He forgets things.",
      "‘I knew that forgetting was a pretty lame defence for my actions, but it was the truth,’ Ferdinand wrote in his book. ‘I never remember anything.’",
      "Pictures of him in Manchester city centre buying new bed linen did little to please the testers who had already left by the time Ferdinand made contact with the club.",

      "But it was the length of Guerrero’s ban that proved to be one of the more interesting aspects of the case. Initially, FIFA gave him a 12-month ban but their appeals committee reduced it to six.",
      "In April 2018, Guerrero filed an appeal to CAS to have it reduced further but at the same time, the World Anti-Doping Agency filed their own case, saying it should have been more.",
      "The Swiss body ruled in WADA’s favour, increasing the ban to 14 months, though Guerrero received an incredible slice of leniency when the Swiss Federal Tribunal agreed to temporarily suspend his ban, allowing him to play at the 2018 World Cup.",
      "Following the end of the tournament in Russia, Guerrero’s 14-month ban was re-imposed.",
      "Let’s be honest, Diego Maradona was always going to be on this list, wasn’t he?",
      "For as gifted as he was on the pitch, the Argentine was troubled off it.",
      "It was during his time in Barcelona when he became addicted to cocaine but it was when he moved to Naples that the problem took hold of him.",
      "In 1991, he was banned for 15 months after testing positive, which proved to be an undignified end to his time at Napoli.",
      "After his suspension, he went to Sevilla, staying for just a single year, but there was to be a further drugs scandal in 1994. Off the back of Argentina’s 2-1 World Cup group stage win over Nigeria, Maradona was selected for a drugs test and pinged for five variants of ephedrine, a stimulant banned by FIFA.",
      "As a result, he was given a second ban of 15 months.",
      "Samir Nasri will never want to hear the words ‘Drip Doctor’ again after the 2018 scandal became an internet meme for the ages.",
      "As a gift from his girlfriend, Nasri was signed up to an IV drip procedure through the Drip Doctors company but the former Arsenal player enjoyed the treatment so much he slept with the nurse.",
      "The reason we all know about this is because Nasri’s girlfriend found out, logged into his Twitter and started posting that the ‘whore comes and f**ks the same night’.",
      "After a wrestle to get back into his own Twitter, Nasri insisted he had been hacked and while UEFA were not too concerned about his personal life, they did take note of just what that IV drip included.",
      "A drugs test showed Nastri had an assortment of vitamins, minerals and micronutrients and while that is allowed in small quantities, the Frenchman had been given over 500 millilitres of the stuff.",
      "UEFA initially handed him a six-month ban before it was increased to 18.",
      "One of the most famous cases in recent years came with Paul Pogba who in September 2023 tested positive after a non-endogenous testosterone was found in his sample.",
      "Another sample produced the same result and in February 2024, Pogba received a four-year ban in what looked like a death sentence for his career.",
      "However, the former Manchester United midfielder took his case to CAS who agreed to reduce the ban to 18 months, clearing Pogba to play from March this year.",
      "But, with his Juventus contract being terminated in November, the 2018 World Cup winner has not yet been able to find a new club.",
      "The longest ban to date ever handed out was from the Brazilian Doping Control Authority to Flamengo forward Gabriel Barbosa.",
      "The interesting thing about this particular ban is that Gabriel was not banned for failing a drugs test but instead making it hard to even complete one.",
      "Ahead of a Flamengo game in the Rio De Janeiro state league, officials tried to take a urine sample from the player but were unable. As a result, the case was taken to the Anti-Doping Sports Justice Court, who narrowly voted 5-4 in favour of giving the Brazilian forward a two-year ban.",
      "After the verdict, Gabriel said he planned to appeal to CAS and in April 2024, the Swiss court paused the ban, allowing for a full investigation before it comes into effect.",

      "‘Here’s why the ex-Liverpool star can be quietly pleased with his debut in the Miami heat,’ say The Sun. And we really want to know why, because a 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal is really quite embarrassing for Real Madrid. And we know that he did something close to the square root of f*** all in that 1-1 draw.",
      "‘An attacking threat?’ ask The Sun. Well, he created the sum total of one chance in 64 minutes so we would say not. Football Espana say ‘he struggled to make an impact in attack before being substituted’ and the statistics certainly back that up.",
      "But according to The Sun: ‘It was his initial pass deep in his own half that started the move which ended with Gonzalo Garcia’s 34th-minute opener. The England international pumped his fists into the air when the ball hit the back of the net.’",
      "Ah, the glorious pre-pre-pre-pre-assist. He really is ‘already showing signs of old class’.",
      "The Sun then note that he ‘looked defensively solid’. Which is true if you ignore all the times he failed to track his winger, the time he was outjumped at a corner, the times players drifted past him (he did not make one tackle) and the time he appeared to entirely forget he was a defender. Apart from all that, he ‘looked defensively solid’.",

      "A transfer insider has suggested that the impending signing of Bryan Mbeumo at Manchester United means there’s a “limited” chance their top scorer keeps his role, but he feels he’ll be “immense” elsewhere.",
      "United have already moved to rectify their forward issues this summer. Last season, during their 15th-placed Premier League campaign, they scored 44 goals in 38 games.",
      "They have signed Matheus Cunha to add some firepower, and Bryan Mbeumo could follow, after 20 goals for Brentford last season.",
      "There’s a battle ongoing between United and Tottenham for the forward, but it’s believed Mbeumo wants to join the Red Devils, while a recent report suggested Spurs had ‘cooled’ their interest as they saw the deal to beat the rival side as ‘impossible’.",
      "That signing, and other United decisions, while push Amad Diallo out of his role, according to insider Graeme Bailey.",
      "He told TBRFootball: “Amad probably knows he’s heading towards playing the right wing-back role.",
      "“If you recall, in [Ruben] Amorim’s first game in charge against Ipswich Town, that’s where Amad played. When he says right wing-back role, a wing-back role in a Ruben Amorim system is not the wing-back role that we usually associate with English football.",
      "“I think the Cunha and Mbeumo signings, and [Joshua] Zirkzee still being there, tell us that the chances of Amad playing as an attacking midfielder are quite limited next season.",
      "“We might see Amad play in that right-side role, that’s what [the transfer moves] are telling us. We know Amad is prepared to play there, he’s done it a number of times for Amorim, and let’s not forget the players who played that position for Amorim – [Geovany] Quenda at Sporting and look how good he is. He’s not a dissimilar type of player.",
      "“It tells us that, while he likely won’t play an attacking-midfield role at United, Amad is still very much in Amorim’s thinking. It’s a position, if they do it right, he’ll become an immense threat in, that [right wing-back] role.”",
      "Diallo was United’s joint-top scorer in the Premier League last season, with eight goals alongside eight assists, and a nunber of those came from the attack.",
      "However, he also showed he was capable of starring in the wing-back position. Amad scored a hat-trick against Southampton in a game he started as a wing-back, and there were more goals and assists in other games he played there, too.",
      "Thomas Frank has given the green light for Tottenham to push for the signing of Eberechi Eze while Spurs have dealt Man Utd a blow in the race for Bryan ...",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the striker he “wants” the Red Devils to sign is “waiting” for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are among the three clubs in the race to sign Nottingham Forest standout Callum Hudson-Odoi.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have edged closer to making their next signing as Tottenham Hotspur have ‘cooled’ their interest.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur are ‘growing in confidence’ as they look to sign a Premier League winger also linked with Manchester United."

      "Manchester United have been handed a boost in their bid to sign a replacement for Andre Onana as a £40m star has ‘offered himself’ to the Red Devils in a ‘major twist’.",
      "It was claimed back in April that Onana had been ‘sentenced’ to the Old Trafford exit, with Nice’s Marcin Bułka and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez among a whole host of goalkeepers linked with a move to replace the Cameroonian.",
      "But transfer expert Ben Jacobs told GIVEMESPORT last week that the United bosses hadn’t yet decided whether to source a new stopper or retain Onana as first choice.",
      "The report stated:",
      "‘Onana went on holiday focused on Manchester United as he has not been warned that he is for sale or at risk of losing his regular starting berth, GMS sources understand, but influential figures are assessing the market and will communicate their decision to him after the initial plan was to bring in a replacement for Altay Bayindir ahead of his expected exit.’",
      "A report on Monday then claimed that they have made their minds up, or rather Amorim has made the decision for them – Onana will remain United’s No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Portuguese boss has ‘conveyed to the board his intention to count on him as a key piece in his project’ and ‘does not contemplate any other alternative’.",
      "It’s claimed Amorim ‘trusts’ Onana and still sees him as the ‘ideal profile’ to build from the back thanks to his ‘technical conditions and ability to play with his feet’.",
      "He insists that Onana can ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure and a well-defined idea of the game’, but the United boss may have his head turned now that Villa’s Martinez ‘has offered himself’ to the club.",
      "GIVEMESPORT claim the World Cup winner wants to join the Red Devils and that Villa ‘have refused to rule out reluctantly granting his wish due to fears of breaching the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules’.",
      "Martinez looked as though he was waving goodbye to the Villa fans after victory over Tottenham last month in their final home game of the season and ‘in a major twist, Martinez has made it clear that he is willing to join Manchester United if they make an approach’.",
      "The report claims Villa want £40m for the 32-year-old as they use AC Milan’s £25m valuation of Mike Maignan amid interest from Chelsea in the France international, ‘complicating matters for Manchester United and Martinez’, though it’s thought Villa do need to sanction big sales amid their PSR concerns.",
      "Maignan has just a year left to run on his deal while Martinez is under contract at Villa park until 2029.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘GMS sources have been informed that Manchester United have still not made a final call on whether to sign a new first-choice option between the sticks or if Andre Onana is surplus to requirements, while Atletico Madrid has been pinpointed as another possible destination for Martinez if Jan Oblak leaves.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a decision on his “favourite” option to replace one of his current starters.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their ‘preferred’ replacement for Andre Onana and all parties are open to the transfer.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘initiated talks’ to sign an elite goalkeeper target, after an ‘agreement’ killed the chances of a Barcelona deal.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana."

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "19) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "20) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",

      "“Until now, our sources had not heard too much on Garnacho other than tentative interest. However, we have been hearing more and more noise on this one throughout this week, and fresh info has also just come in on him.",
      "“SPTC sources have heard that Chelsea have been discussing signing Garnacho on a loan to buy deal, just as they did with Jadon Sancho. Of course, both players are Manchester United players, so it would not be a deal that would be unfamiliar to either club and could suit both if the fee is right. I’m not sure if it would be a permanent buy with an option to send him back with a fee, or a straight loan with an option/obligation.",
      "“There is nothing to suggest this is definitely what will happen, but it is something that has been discussed internally at Chelsea should they decide to go for Garnacho.”",

      "Man Utd are also said to be ‘very close’ to their second summer signing, as they are expected to fend off competition from Spurs to sign Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season. Recent reports have suggested that the Brentford forward could cost around £65m this summer.",
      "Ferdinand has explained why he is “happy” with the Cunha signing, while he “knows” Mbeumo “wants” to join Man Utd.",
      "“I’m happy with Cunha, he’s one of the ones I mentioned on my list. I hope it goes well for him,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel, as reported by ManUNews.com.",
      "READ: Arsenal and Man Utd ‘nightmare start’ as Premier League fixture day delivers again",
      "“The problem is that I’ve been happy many times in transfer windows and it’s gone wrong.",
      "“I’m hoping he’s not going to be added to that list. If they get Mbeumo, I’d be very happy.”",
      "When asked why he thinks Mbeumo’s proposed deal is being spoken about as if it’s completed, Ferdinand answered: “Because he wants to come. Mbeumo wants to come, I know it.",
      "“His stats over the last three seasons in the Premier League are up there, by the way. Goals and assists, goal chances, ridiculous.",
      "“Again, another proven Premier League player. This is what I like, played in the Premier League. There ain’t no adjustment business.",
      "“The only thing is there will be adjustment because of the size of the club.",
      "“They don’t have to do that when they go to Arsenal! There ain’t that pressure, the badge ain’t as heavy! It’s heavy, but it’s not as heavy!”",
      "Mbeumo, like Cunha, would be a great signing for the Red Devils, but they are still crying out for a new striker and Ferdinand has called for his former side to land Napoli outcast Victor Osimhen, who has been linked with a swap deal to Liverpool.",
      "After spending the 2024/25 campaign at Galatasaray on loan, Osimhen has reportedly turned down a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal and Ferdinand reckons this is because he fancies a move to Man Utd.",
      "“No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen!” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“It looks like he’s turned down Al-Hilal… he must be waiting for Manchester United.",
      "“I don’t know if Manchester United are going to come. That’s the problem.”",

      "According to reports, Manchester United would sanction Marcus Rashford’s move to FC Barcelona, but they want a player in return.",
      "Rashford‘s future is up in the air after he returned to form during his loan spell at Aston Villa.",
      "The Man Utd forward had limited options in January due to his poor form and huge salary, but Villa took a punt on the England international after selling Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr.",
      "This paid off as Rashford grabbed four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Aston Villa, who are among the clubs interested in signing him permanently this summer.",
      "However, Rashford’s improved form and Aston Villa’s failure to qualify for the Champions League could impact their hopes of signing the Man Utd outcast this summer.",
      "It has also been widely reported that he favours a move to Barcelona as the La Liga champions are his ‘dream’ destination.",
      "READ: Arsenal and Man Utd ‘nightmare start’ as Premier League fixture day delivers again",
      "Barcelona already have Lamine Yamal and Raphinha to choose from, but it has been widely reported that their priority is to sign a new winger as cover, with Rashford, Luis Diaz and Nico Williams among their targets.",
      "In recent days, it’s emerged that they have stepped up their interest in Williams, but a new report in Spain claims this saga is far from over.",
      "While Diaz’s proposed move to Barcelona is ‘ruled out’ due to Liverpool’s refusal to reduce their asking price, Williams’ switch is ‘complicated’ as they need him to ‘take a pay cut’ and push for Athletic Bilbao to accept a ‘split payment’ deal.",
      "This means Rashford remains an option as his ‘exit is inevitable’ and he is the ‘most financially accessible’ option.",
      "However, Man Utd have ‘asked’ for ‘something significant in return’, with centre-back Ronald Araujo ’emerging as an unexpected’ option.",
      "The report claims Barcelona could be open to this deal, but doubts are surrounding Araujo’s interest in Man Utd.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Araujo’s case is complex. Although he recently renewed his contract, he has lost prominence this season. Therefore, Barcelona would not object to his departure if it allows them to strengthen a priority position like the left wing. The €65 million release clause he signed in his renewal is geared toward that end.",
      "‘However, Araújo’s own intentions are an obstacle. The Uruguayan doesn’t want to leave for a team that doesn’t guarantee him a starting spot from day one, especially if that club doesn’t compete in Europe’s elite [competition].’",
      "Everybody but The Sun agrees that Trent Alexander-Arnold was poor on his Real Madrid debut while Marcus Rashford SHOCK emerges.",
      "Newcastle are ‘ready to offer’ the Manchester United star an escape route and are ‘confident of providing him with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’.",
      "Manchester United star Marcus Rashford would reportedly ‘accept a pay cut’ to join a rival Premier League club and there are ‘two’ teams ‘to watch’.",
      "Why send Marcus Rashford on loan when the alternatives aren’t as good? ‘Talent alone doesn’t go to United to die, sense does.’",
      "Manchester United will have to wait for a European giant to spring into action in the ‘latter stages’ of the summer transfer window for a sale, so hopes of it ...",
      "A new FC Barcelona transfer target could reportedly  ‘close the door’ on Marcus Rashford’s proposed move from Manchester United to the La Liga giants."

      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",

      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "\"I think it can be the life of a footballer and you need to accept it.\"",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals in a Brentford side that finished 10th and narrowly missed out on European football.",
      "\"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League,\" he added. \"And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "Brentford's impressive season led to Spurs hiring Frank as their new head coach and Mbeumo expects the Dane to succeed at his new club.",
      "\"He's done so much for me. He literally trusted me from the start,\" Mbeumo said. \"I think he developed the team so well.",
      "\"He developed me as a human and a player as well. So I can only wish him all the best, and I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"I think he knows everything. He's really smart. He knows where he wants to bring the team, how he wants to play. I think he's been fantastic for Brentford.",
      "\"I think he's going to have some time to adapt, obviously. [Champions League] games, more expectations, as you said, but I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"He knows how to talk to people. He knows how to build a group. And that's why we've been playing so well.\"",
      "Brentford's set-piece coach Keith Andrews is one of the main candidates to replace Frank as head coach.",
      "Andrews had been part of Frank's coaching staff since last year and is well-regarded within the club.",
      "Brentford promoted from within last time they required a new head coach, with Frank having been Dean Smith's assistant.",
      "Andrews is one of a handful of names Brentford are seriously considering, but a final decision has not yet been made.",
      "\"It's big shoes to fill,\" Mbeumo said. \"I think, (Frank had) seven years as a head coach. So, obviously it's going to be changing, but let's see.\"",

      "By Sky Germany",
      "Thursday 12 June 2025 22:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, according to Sky Germany.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea are also thought to be interested in the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal.",
      "It is understood United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for Ekitike with Frankfurt demanding around £85m (€100m).",
      "United are in the market for a striker after the arrival of Wolves' Matheus Cunha and the potential signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Chelsea and Liverpool considered among the next landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Read more about Hugo Ekitike's rise",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers."
