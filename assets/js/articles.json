      "A former hooligan recalled risking his life on a brutal away day where he claimed ambushing fans were armed with bricks and Stanley knives. Tony O’Neill was once regarded as Britain’s most notorious football hooligan. Back in the 1970s, he became a key figure in two Manchester United firms, Red Army and later the Casuals, and hewas known as ‘the general’.",
      "But on April 23, 1974, he travelled to Merseyside when he was just 15 to watch a soon to be relegated United take on Everton at Goodison Park. And speaking on his Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel for his ‘Fan Culture' series, he spoke about the chaos that unfolded.",
      "His mum initially forbade him from going but eventually he joined up with The Red Army who made their way to Liverpool.",
      "He said people had been speaking about the game for weeks. Tony remembered: “We knew what we was up against. This was going to be war. And I mean war. We were going to take on the scousers.”",
      "He said hundreds of United fans packed the trains before arriving at Lime Street Station where trouble immediately broke out. Tony said the group stood their ground before being welcomed by bricks once they started to make their way to the football stadium.",
      "“Bricks came flying over at us while we were on the march,” he said. “What a solid march, but a frightening walk if you were on your own or in small groups. But not this gang, this gang was massive and it was solid. There was no moving it.”",
      "He said this was a victory for the firm but the real violence took place after the match where Everton came out 1-0 winners in what was a night game.",
      "“I was depressed because I knew we were going down,” Tony recalled. “But we knew what we had to do. The gates open and we have got to be at the front. We knew the rules going there. This has always been the motto, go out there and whatever happens, happens. Take it to them. Don’t go hiding, don’t be sneaking off, especially in Merseyside.”",
      "Fights broke out outside Goodison Park but disputes between United fans took place where some wanted to get on coaches back to Lime Street and others wanted to march back.",
      "Tony was one of the ones who walked and he said it was “absolutely stupid” and the \"daftest thing you can do in the dark at Merseyside”. “You are going taking your life in your hands,” he added.",
      "Despite knowing he was going to get ambushed, Tony and the now smaller mob reached the end of Stanley Park, and that’s when the real danger commenced.",
      "“That was the nightmare of all nightmares,” he recalled. “They all were Liverpool fans. They just come screaming down the side street, straight into us.",
      "“Oh my God, I just bottled it. What is going on here? This is a nightmare. They had the street and they were running down it straight into us and people just bottled it straight away.",
      "“There is no disgrace in it whatsoever, you were outnumbered, in the dark, you were ambushed. And they caught us. I just legged it straight down.”",
      "He added: “I didn’t look behind me to see what is going on because this is now your life and you also know you are getting robbed, you are getting slashed, you are getting beat up, you are getting done in, there is no mercy here. They were out to get you and they were everywhere. I just kept running and didn’t look back. It is every man for himself.”",
      "Asked to elaborate on Stanley knives being present, he added: “Everyone was up for a fight, that’s what was happening up and down the country. But these took it to a different level and that was what you were fearful of.”",
      "Running for his life, Tony said bricks rained down on him, and at one point his shoe fell off, forcing him to kneel down while his two pals sprinted away.",
      "He described being “so relieved” to get back to Lime Station unharmed, calling it the longest run of his life. “I got away with my life, and I mean got away with my life,” he said.",
      "Speaking about the atmosphere on the train back, he said: “We were all made up. This is the blueprint of how we are going to go to Liverpool or Everton in the future. We knew we could take it to them - it just needed a little more organising.”",
      "Tony, now the author of Red Army General and The Men in Black, then said within 18 months to two years, Manchester United became the main firm in the country. The former hardman now lives a very different life, and in 2017, he started working at Gary Neville’s and Ryan Giggs’ Hotel Football.",
      "He was handpicked by Neville to work security and speaking about his role, he once said: “I’ve stopped going to games. Me and my wife Debbie do the rooftop at Hotel Football on a match day.",
      "“The whole idea is to make it about the supporters’ clubs. The Hotel is a four-star, but the intention of the hotel was to be where the fans could mix.",
      "“The whole idea was to make it accessible, near Old Trafford, for the fans. I get the supporters clubs in. I get the right people in. People love to mix and see proper United fans.”"

      "UEFA will not move the Europa League final from Bilbao despite concerns over the size of the San Mames stadium. The Spanish city won the right to host this year's event way back in 2021.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur will be the two teams to fight it out to lift the trophy. United won this competition in 2017, while the last time Tottenham lifted a European trophy was 1984.",
      "The Red Devils scuppered Athletic Bilbao's hopes of playing a final in their own stadium at the semi-final stage. Ruben Amorim's side won 3-0 in the first leg in Spain, before claiming a 4-1 victory in the second leg at Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "Spurs meanwhile avoided the embarrassment of losing to Norwegian minnows Bodo/Glimt, following up a 3-1 in the first leg with a 2-0 victory in the return fixture on Thursday night.",
      "That set the stage for an all-Premier League final, to be held on 18 May. But given the supporter base of the two clubs, concerns had been raised over whether Bilbao would be big enough to host the final.",
      "According to the Independent, UEFA have rubbished those concerns and there is 'no chance' of the final being moved to an English venue. The San Mames has an official capacity of 53,289.",
      "Demand for tickets from the two finalists' supporters will be far higher than what both teams will be allocated. Both United and Spurs will have an allocation of 15,000 tickets, with a further 11,000 up for general sale and the remainder ringfenced for hospitality and sponsors.",
      "Previous all-English European finals have all been played at their original hosts, including Chelsea's Champions League win over Manchester City in 2021 (Porto), Liverpool's defeat of Spurs in the same competition in 2019 (Madrid) and the Blues' win over Arsenal in the Europa League in 2019 (Baku).",
      "Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou is keen to take on United. He said: \"It's going to upset a lot of people isn't it. The debate's now raging. The latest one is that neither of us will be able to get a trophy if we win, they're just going to take a team photo because we're not worthy.",
      "\"I mean, who cares if we're struggling in the league? If it's so easy to get to a final, then why doesn't everyone who finishes in the top three do it? It's a separate thing. It's got nothing to do with league form. I think both us and Manchester United have earned the right to be there.\"",
      "Amorim meanwhile has insisted anything other than winning the final will be a failure. He said: “I'm stressed already because of the final, because if you don't win it, in the end, it's nothing. So, we are happy to be there. Let's see.",
      "\"I think it's going to be a really good game. A little bit emotional because both teams are struggling a lot in the Premier League and want to win something. Two teams who play in the same league and know each other.",
      "\"It means a lot, not just to us but also for Tottenham. It means a lot, not just for me but also for Ange [Postecoglou], after this season. It's a massive game and I know it's going to be tough for the people in Bilbao because they wanted to play in the final at home.\""

And with the tie hanging in the balance at 3-3 on aggregate, he proved the hero of the tie once more by setting up Abde Ezzalzouli with a squared pass for an extra-time winner.",
      "His team-mates rushed to celebrate with him as jubilant scenes broke out in the away end of the Stadio Artemio Franchi. And Antony couldn’t hide his emotions, bursting into tears on the pitch and in his post-match interview.",
      "The £86million winger said: \"My family knows what we went through to be here. I have cried a lot with my mother, with my wife and with my siblings. Because we went through very tough times. I am living a dream now.\"",
      "Antony was talking about his extremely difficult two-and-a-half years in Manchester, having been bought for an eye-watering sum in the summer of 2022 which put pressure on him from the outset. He was reunited with his former Ajax coach Erik ten Hag at United but failed to deliver for the English giants under the Dutchman and successor Ruben Amorim, resulting in him being brutally mocked and criticised throughout his Red Devils spell.",
      "Antony finally secured a loan exit from his United nightmare in January and has stunned the footballing world by appearing a completely different player in Seville. The Brazil international has eight goals and five assists in 21 games for Betis, having scored just 12 times in his entire United spell.",
      "He has now etched his name into Betis folklore by playing a key role in their advancement to the Conference League final, where they will face Chelsea in Wroclaw, Poland, on Wednesday, May 28.",
      "Antony previously noted one reason for his upturn in form, saying: “Yes, I'm very happy. I found myself. I needed to find myself and be happy. My family needed to be happy too. Every day that passes confirms it was the best decision and as you said, I'm enjoying the city and the club every day.",
      "“It [Seville] reminds me a lot of Brazil: the sun, the food, everything. The people are also very warm and happy; that's important for us who come from Brazil and are used to that. As I've said, I'm very happy.",
      "“It's important to score goals and provide assists but for me what's most important is sleeping peacefully knowing how I'm doing with myself and being well and happy. Seeing my family smiling is also essential for me; I always talk to my family in Brazil and they are also very happy for me.”"

      "After Mason Mount had rubber-stamped Manchester United’s passage to the Europa League final with his first goal of the night, he stood in front of the Stretford End and cupped his ear. Maybe he was making a reference to the talk that he was the sort of expensive signing that symbolises the club’s failings in recent years.",
      "Or maybe, after the frustration brought on by his painful struggles with injury, he just wanted to hear the acclaim that signified a rare positive step in his Old Trafford career. Or maybe he was cheekily asking the crowd to show proper appreciation for the one moment of elite-class skill that turned a fairly mediocre United performance into a glorious procession to the final.",
      "Never mind that Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund .and Mount again would make it a crushing United victory on the night, it was Mount’s sublime turn and finish just under 20 minutes from the end that was the pivotal moment in a game that had been run by Athletic for a good hour or so.",
      "Quite frankly, United were pretty abysmal until Mount struck with an individual effort that was a reminder of why so many top coaches down the years have adored this wonderful footballer. And after that, Athletic went to pieces, as they had done in Bilbao.",
      "But for half an hour, there was not even a suggestion United might add to their three-goal advantage and the Bilbao breakthrough was hardly a surprise. But the mistake that gave the half-chance to Mikel Jauregizar was a surprise, coming, as it did, from Harry Maguire.",
      "The misplaced pass still looked unlikely to be too damaging but Jauregizar struck his effort nicely enough to beat Andre Onana’s delayed take-off. At least it gave United a nudge of urgency and they would have been level just before the break had Alejandro Garnacho not once again shown that he can be a scorer of great goals rather than a great goalscorer.",
      "Occasionally doing the spectacular is great, frequently doing the routine is better. And it should have been a routine finish when Patrick Dorgu put him in the clear but his attempt to send a chip over Julen Agirrezabala went badly awry.",
      "The miss meant a pervading sense of anxiety remained and that is why, just after the hour mark, Ruben Amorim opted for a triple change of personnel - Mount, Luke Shaw and Amad Diallo all entering the fray. The alterations had the desired effect, to say the least.",
      "And after Mount’s brilliance and Casemiro’s quick-thinking finish, Diallo’s directness enabled him to set up Rasmus Hojlund, who, literally, only had to let the assist hit his foot to get on the scoresheet. Three-one and even Hojlund scored.",
      "Whether or not it was worthy of a celebratory selfie is open for debate but the man who should have been posing for photos finished the job in quite remarkable fashion. When a clearance reached Mount just inside the Athletic half he responded with a first-time, left-footed hit that must have travelled a good 50 yards or so.",
      "Both of Mount’s goals were a measure of a talent that, for reasons beyond the player’s control, Old Trafford has yet to enjoy. Here, that talent has made sure United have an endgame of a European final … but for Mount himself, this will, hopefully, be a new beginning."

      "Their Europa League win earned them a place alongside Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs in the competition. All five clubs reached the knockout stage which made England the first ever nation to have five teams in the competition's last 16.."

      "Manchester United will face Tottenham in an all-English Europa League final after staving off a comeback from Athletic Bilbao. The Red Devils went into this semi-final second leg at Old Trafford with a command 3-0 lead, having romped to victory in Spain last Thursday.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were firm favourites to advance but when Harry Maguire played a sloppy pass which was cut out by Bilbao and punished in style by Mikel Jauregizar, United looked far less confident. Their nerves were on show at the start of the second half and it took a triple change from Amorim to turn the tide.",
      "One of those substitutes, Mason Mount, scored the crucial goal to restore the Red Devils' three-goal lead on aggregate, the best moment of his United career to date - and his first goal at Old Trafford. Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund then got in on the act with a goal each, as Amorim & Co. continued their unbeaten run in Europe and sealed a place in the final against Spurs.",
      "Two minutes of stoppage time looked a formality but Mount doubled up with a sensational strike from distance, making it 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "Here are six talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "A team on the verge of a European final and a team desperate for a comeback was always going to have the makings of a cracking atmosphere ahead of kick-off. Manchester United allowed fans to display another tifo like ahead of last month's quarter-final second leg at home to Lyon while fireworks were set off to engulf the stadium in smoke.",
      "With banners unfurled in the Stretford End, Old Trafford looked a picture - and it about the most interesting thing we got until Patrick Dorgu went down in the penalty area after 23 minutes. Dorgu went tumbling over after contact from Andoni Gorosabel and a VAR check took place, but German referee Daniel Siebert wasn't instructed to review his decision of no penalty.",
      "The hero of that Lyon game, Harry Maguire, played the role of villain as Bilbao took the lead on the night and gave themselves an inkling of hope. His sloppy pass was too far in front of Leny Yoro and after Alvaro Djalo's initial shot was blocked, Mikel Jauregizar picked up the ball from more than 20 yards out and unleashed a superb strike which nestled in the top right-hand corner.",
      "Jauregizar's goal sent the away end wild, as the men from the Basque country took the first step towards an unlikely comeback just after half-hour mark. The nerves immediately set in for United fans, who'd been through nearly every emotion possible the last time they were here on a European night.",
      "What would've settled the nerves was a goal and United had plenty of chances in the first half. The best fell to Alejandro Garnacho on the brink of half-time, as Dorgu slid him through on goal and Old Trafford held its breath.",
      "Left of the 'keeper? Right? Through his legs? What would Garnacho do? Instead, he chose the option that no one was anticipating. The United winger tried to dink the ball over Julen Agirrezabala and got it horribly wrong, as the Bilbao goalkeeper was able to watch it drift wide.",
      "Shades of Danny Welbeck against Bayern Munich in 2014. Would the Red Devils suffer the same outcome?",
      "There's no clearer sign of a game going wrong than an angry manager making a triple change. After a woeful start to the second half, Ruben Amorim turned to his substitutes and brought on Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Amad.",
      "The Red Devils boss was visibly unhappy with how his team were failing to keep the ball, as Bilbao grew in confidence with sustained attacks. Amorim's men had ceded full control and needed to turn the tide quickly, as the visitors also made three changes - in much more positive fashion - at the same time.",
      "After Garnacho had emulated Welbeck, Mount found a better finish to copy. Amorim's changes instantly reinvigorated United and one of them proved particularly vital.",
      "Mount, whose United career has had far more lows than highs, swivelled on the ball inside the penalty area and curled the ball with his right foot past the sprawling Agirrezabala. Robbie Savage likened it to Federico Macheda's goal against Aston Villa in 2009, another moment with huge importance.",
      "United weren't done there, though, as Casemiro's glancing finish and a tap-in from Rasmus Hojlund - assisted by another sub, Amad - sealed the victort in style. And Mount wasn't finished even then, as he intercepted a clearance from Agirrezabala and finished from long range.",
      "Will Manchester United beat Tottenham in the Europa League final? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "An all-English affair will take place in Bilbao - coincidentally - on Wednesday, May 21. Tottenham had no concerns about a concerns about a comeback in Norway as they beat Bodo/Glimt 2-0 on the night to seal a 5-1 aggregate win.",
      "United have already lost three times to Spurs this season, so they'll need to come up with something different to beat Ange Postecoglou's team. It should be a tasty full English."

That Covid-impacted final was a hollow experience that served up 120 moribund minutes between United and Villarreal.",

      "\"It’s not just playing Champions League next season, it’s that feeling that we can change things.\"",
      "Champions League qualification was not at the forefront of United fans' minds during their sole triumph in the Europa League. The 2017 final in Stockholm stirred raw emotions, held 48 hours after the barbaric Manchester Arena attack. On a sporting level, United completed the set by lifting a trophy whose silhouette did not previously appear on their honours' board.",
      "Tottenham have won the Uefa Cup twice. They have reached a Champions League final much more recently than United. As easy as some find it to deride Spurs, they are a bigger club than some that will finish in the top five of the Premier League and they boast European pedigree.",
      "United, for such a storied club, should have more European honours than the five they celebrated with their first tifo before the quarter-final tie with Lyon. We enter and exit the Old Trafford media centre via the Munich tunnel, a reminder not just of the tragedy that decimated the club in 1958 but the trailblazer that Sir Matt Busby and his Babes were when they embraced the European Cup competition.",
      "Leaving last night, a young fan asked about the final. It is a fascinating dynamic. Amorim admitted - with a chuckle - he and Ange Postecoglou are both \"struggling\". Spurs have won four and drawn one against United under Postecoglou.",
      "\"But they're bottlers,\" the lad wryly added. One cannot argue with that. Since Spurs beat Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final, they have lost finals in 2009, 2015, 2019 and 2021. 'Spursy' entered the football lexicon some time ago.",
      "Many are banking on United's mettle, disregarding their recent record against Spurs. \"Every game has its history,\" Amorim said. \"We lost the three last games, we can win this one, so if you look at the loss, we are closer to win than to lose.",
      "\"Both teams are going to play all or nothing. The position of the coach is quite similar. I know Ange has one more year (on his contract), it is different, the context, but we are struggling, both of us! I don’t know what is going to happen, it’s a good thing and a bad thing with this team, I never know!\"",
      "Postecoglou is 90 minutes away from making good on his pledge that \"I always win things in my second year\". The final is expected to be his last match in charge of Spurs. Looking from the outside, that inevitability seems to have emboldened him to ensure he leaves on a high Tottenham have not experienced in 17 years.",
      "Objectively, Spurs edge United in most areas. Guglielmo Vicario has been a better goalie than Andre Onana since they stepped foot on these shores from Europe's boot. Pedro Porro and Destiny Udogie trump Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu. Micky van de Ven is one of the Premier League's best centre halves when fit. They have more technically rounded midfielders than United and Dominic Solanke is a more reliable marksman than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "But we come back to Sir Alex Ferguson's most famous team talk: lads, it's Tottenham. United's Europa League record is daunting: 16 games, nine wins, five draws, no defeats and 35 goals scored. In the six knockout ties, United plundered 19 goals while their Premier League goal difference sank towards minus double figures.",
      "United also have greater depth. Athletic Bilbao petered out quicker than the pyrotechnic smoke after Amad, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo were introduced on Thursday night. Spurs are certain to be without Lucas Bergvall and James Maddison in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim should dismiss United's 3-0 humbling by Tottenham in September. Erik ten Hag was still clinging on and United's season was an extension of last season. Nothing was going to change until they changed the manager.",
      "The madcap League Cup tie in December is hardly relevant, either. United had Altay Bayindir, Antony and Christian Eriksen in their starting XI. Bayindir was not even the worst 'keeper on the pitch, with the cumbersome Fraser Forster up the other end.",
      "As for the 1-0 league loss in February, United were so depleted that Victor Lindelof was the bench's babysitter. Eight of the nine substitutes had never played for the club at the time. The only substitution Amorim made, a debut for Chido Obi, was in the 89th minute.",
      "It is a quirk of fate that United could win their second Europa League under a second Portuguese manager. Amorim and Jose Mourinho are the only United managers to reach a European final in their first season.",
      "Mourinho, of course, also managed Spurs and guided them to their last final in 2021. He was sacked six days before Spurs surrendered to City with Ryan Mason in the dugout for his first match in management.",
      "Of all his sackings, Mourinho told his former player John Obi Mikel that \"the most ridiculous one was a club that has an empty trophy room [and] sacks me two days before a final\". After City beat Spurs, Mourinho sent a friend an image of the 'Finalists 2020/21' keyring that Spurs had seriously flogged.",
      "That is football heritage."

      "For Manchester United and Tottenham, this is about the silverware and the shekels. For the winner, there will be the riches and the lustre of a Champions League campaign next season. For the loser, there will be the ignominy of one of the worst seasons in their club's history, and if that is Postecoglou, probably a P45 to boot.",
      "Ruben Amorim won't face that fate if the result doesn't go United's way on May 21 but you can be certain the Portuguese head coach is desperate for a trophy to add credence to his Old Trafford face-lift and significantly boost his budget in what is a key first summer window.",
      "For Postecoglou, it feels like win or bust, and reading his comments after Tottenham silenced the doubters by winning with relative ease in Norway on Thursday, it feels like he is already trying to start the mind games ahead of an all-Premier League showdown.",
      "The Aussie was asked about Amorim's comments that winning the Europa League wouldn't save United's season, but rather than acknowledge Spurs have underperformed in the Premier League, he came out swinging, deliberately misinterpreting those comments as he sought to paint the narrative that this final simply means more to Tottenham.",
      "\"Why do I care what Manchester United think? Ask the Manchester United manager why he says that. I've said all along this is important,\" said Postecoglou.",
      "\"What's happening right now is people are fearing that. That it actually might happen. And let's see if we can tear it down and diminish it somehow by saying it's been a poor season and we don't deserve this or that and comparing us to Manchester United.",
      "\"Maybe if we'd had Manchester United's success I'd have a different view.",
      "\"But I came into this role...I could have been sitting here in fifth position and I guarantee the commentary would have been: 'That's great Ange but this club needs to win something.'",
      "\"Of course it's massive. You have to frame it against what this club has been through over the last 15-20 years, what the supporters have been through. Manchester United have got their own journey. Maybe if they go 15 years without winning something they'll change their own perspective as well.\"",
      "There are several aspects of this answer that make little sense, so it's worth dealing with them in order. For starters, Amorim's comments that winning the Europa League wouldn't save the club's season wasn't a disparaging aside about Europe's secondary competition, it was an admittance that a disastrous Premier League campaign cannot be ignored.",
      "Postecoglou appears determined to do just that, and when his job is on the line, perhaps you can see why. However, there is an argument that the differing views here simply speak to a difference in the standards they expect. Amorim knows that 15th in the Premier League over a 38-game season isn't good enough, regardless of the success that comes in cup competitions.",
      "Postecoglou has been telling critics he always wins a trophy in his second season for most of the year. Although Spurs sit 16th in the Premier League, he appears to believe that would be acceptable as long as he is hoisting the 65cm high trophy in the Basque Country in a couple of weeks. Tottenham fans will probably disagree.",
      "Within his answer, Postecoglou cites the long trophy drought in North London, and he is right that winning the Europa League will be a memorable night for the club and the supporters, but when the ticker tape is cleared away and the parade is finished with, the bare facts will still make for unpalatable reading. It is over a league season where managers are judged, and when a domestic campaign has been as bad as United's and Tottenham's, no amount of silverware can transform it.",
      "It's also not the case that Amorim is downplaying winning the Europa League because United have won 20 league titles and three European Cups. It doesn't reduce the meaning of this trophy. He is saying what he is because he accepts no excuses can be made for a dismal league campaign.",
      "When it comes to kick-off in Bilbao, Tottenham will probably be the neutrals' choice. The idea that people are fearing Spurs winning a trophy suggests their manager is overestimating the strength of feeling for a club that doesn't really stir any strong emotions outside of the London derby bubble.",
      "Nobody is saying United or Tottenham don't deserve to win the Europa League. Both have navigated difficult fixtures and tough moments to reach the final. They would be worthy winners. What Amorim is saying is that even that success won't gloss over what has happened domestically. Postecoglou should probably try the same honest approach."

      "\"Yes, I was consulted,\" Amorim said. \"And again, I already spoke about that. We cannot say nothing after this season.",
      "\"So we need to help the club, because the club wins some money. We are going to connect with our fans around the world and that is important, especially when we lose and we disappoint our supporters during this tough season. So I think it's the least we can do.",
      "\"And we are going to take all the team, young kids also, we'll have the staff there. We have a lot of changes in the staff, so we are trying to build something as a family. I think it's also a good thing.\"",

      "“Many clubs are following Jonathan Tah, including Premier League sides. Still, we shouldn’t overlook the fact that Bayern Munich had an agreement in the pipeline last summer, and now he’s set to become a free agent. It would be easier to bring him in now, and Bayern have made it clear that they need a new centre-back with Eric Dier set to join Monaco this summer. So Bayern Munich will look to try and get him.",
      "“Manchester United, who have been linked with Tah, is always going to be a serious competitor. I think Jonathan Tah would like to have an experience in the Premier League. There aren’t so many clubs searching in this position, so, of course, United is an opportunity.”",
      "Manchester United have entered the race to sign Paris Saint-Germain striker Goncalo Ramos, according to reports.",

      "\"Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system. I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.\"",

      "\"Do you know what I kept thinking during the game,\" he said on The Overlap. \"With the way Man United are playing with a back-five and wing-backs under Ruben Amorim, I was thinking about that right wing-back.",

      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly offered himself to Barcelona through the super agent Pini Zahavi.",
      "Mundo Deportivo claims that Zahavi is now the player's representative, which they describe as a strategic move made over recent days. The intention behind doing so is reputedly because it boosts the chances of a move to the Catalan club this summer.",

      "\"Madders from the first leg,\" Postecoglou said when asked for the latest team news. \"So he's out. He'll miss the rest of this season and disappointing for him. I'm disappointed for him because he's been a real catalyst for us. He'll miss out but that's been the story of our season.",

      "If Greenwood was to move to Anfield, and that would seem highly unlikely at this stage, United would benefit from a sizeable sell-on clause that was inserted into the deal that saw him move permanently to Marseille last summer.",
      "Maybe wing-backs are making a comeback. Ruben Amorim's three-man defence is yet to catch the imagination at Manchester United, but elsewhere, there is evidence that the system is capable of delivering teams that challenge at the very top.",
      "On Tuesday night, Simone Inzaghi's Internazionale reached a second Champions League final in three years after winning perhaps the greatest semi-final the competition has ever seen, beating Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate after two games of the highest quality.",
      "Inzaghi might just be the most under-appreciated coach in Europe, and steering this ageing Inter side to another shot at the European Cup is a remarkable triumph. Matteo Darmian still gets games on a regular basis, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan is a key man in midfield at 36.",

      "\"I think he is going to be a top, top, top player and is going to have a great career here in Manchester,\" Ruben Amorim said of Leny Yoro earlier this year.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made that prediction two days after Yoro had produced arguably his most accomplished performance for the club up to that point in a 3-2 win over Ipswich Town at Old Trafford.",
      "Deployed on the left of the back-three, Yoro made it his personal mission to get himself on the ball as often as he could and help United progress the ball from deep, despite not playing on his natural side.",
      "Following United's switch to a three-at-the-back formation after Amorim's appointment back in November, it was quickly anticipated Yoro would become the Portuguese chief's first-choice option to start at right-sided centre-back and help United progress the ball on that side of the pitch.",
      "Despite having stints in the team in that position, the best of the Frenchman's displays have come as the left-sided centre-back, despite him being right-footed, further highlighted by his top drawer performance against Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford on Thursday night.",
      "Just as he had against Athletic at the San Mames Stadium seven days earlier, Yoro was deployed on the left of the back-three, joining forces in defence with Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof. He was the coolest operator of the trio and his performance was arguably his best yet in a United shirt, helping them reach the Europa League final with a 7-1 aggregate triumph.",
      "As well as winning ten of his 14 duels, producing five clearances, blocking four shots, winning two tackles and making one interception in a superb defensive display, the 19-year-old also produced an excellent performance with the ball, frequently showing a hunger to get United up the pitch and into advanced areas.",
      "He completed 88 per cent of his attempted passes, produced two key passes and got the assist for Mason Mount's superb equaliser. For the goal, he received a square pass from Luke Shaw high up the pitch, dropped his shoulder, advanced into the penalty area and nudged the ball into Mount's feet to turn and shoot.",
      "Both the turn and the finish from Mount were superb, but they would not have been possible without Yoro's willingness to advance into such an attacking position.",
      "In the modern game, centre-backs are constantly encouraged to be strong in possession and take risks to help their team get up the pitch. United strengthened that particular skill in the summer of 2022 by recruiting ball-playing centre-back Lisandro Martinez, who embraced Yoro after the full-time whistle on Thursday evening.",
      "Like Yoro, he has not been without his injury problems since joining United, meaning they have been starved of that ball-playing expertise too often this season. However, Yoro's ever-improving performances are now giving United an extra dimension they can lean on.",
      "And the former Lille man, who joined United last summer for an initial fee of £52.2million, admitted after last month's goalless draw with Manchester City at Old Trafford that Amorim had been encouraging him to carry the ball into advanced positions.",
      "Yoro said: \"We need to control the game. If I can bring the ball forward for the strikers, for the midfielders, it is good for us, so I try to do it.",
      "\"Yes, the coach has asked me to do it, I am ready to do it and I can do it.\"",
      "Yoro completed 89 per cent of his passes against City that afternoon, once again highlighting his composure and confidence with the ball at his feet. Over his last ten starts, his passing accuracy of 88 per cent against Athletic on Thursday night was the lowest accuracy percentage he has recorded in that period, with him completing 93 per cent of his attempted passes five times in his last ten starts.",
      "With the numbers backing up his on-the-eye displays, Yoro's performances are undoubtably getting better with every game he plays. After the start of his United career was delayed until December because of a pre-season injury, he is now rapidly making up for lost time.",
      "His ball-carrying expertise is a massive feather in his cap, making it easy to understand why United had to see off interest from Real Madrid last summer to win the race for his signature.",
      "Backed to become a \"top, top, top player\" by Amorim just over two months ago, the Frenchman's displays mean he that he is well on his way to proving the United boss right."

      "A Union Jack was unfurled in the Stretford End on VE Day. Manchester United are now one victory away from salvaging their season.",
      "Those flags were ubiquitous in Rotterdam for United's second European final in 1991. It was dusted off at an opportune time. United have a ninth European final back in Bilbao.",
      "With United 1-0 down, the Stretford End still broke into a rendition of 'Cause United are going to Bilbao'. They will. The 7-1 aggregate scoreline does Athletic Bilbao a disservice but that is United in Europe this season.",
      "The majority of this performance was more in keeping with United's domestic form than their European pedigree. For most of the night, United lived up to their manager's billing as the worst in living memory.",
      "And still United summoned the gumption to not just avoid defeat but win emphatically. They put four goals past Athletic, aided by three substitutions.",
      "Amad, somehow not starting, was scintillating following his game-changing introduction. Mason Mount sparked the comeback with a first Old Trafford goal and he rounded off the scoring with a strike so supreme that Ruben Amorim finally broke into a smile. The stars in Europe seem to be aligning for United.",
      "In the Europa League, at least, United are just like watching Seville. Their love affair with the Europa League is similar to the seven-time winners who thwarted them in the 2020 semi-finals.",
      "Yet United are 14 unbeaten in the Europa League and still the only undefeated team in Europe. It is 19 goals in six knockout ties. For the second successive round, they tallied seven goals across both legs. In the Premier League, their goal difference is a pitiful -9.",
      "They have also lifted their Spanish hex in knockout competitions. The sequence of eliminations to La Liga opponents has ended at six.",
      "\"Don't go out tonight, unless you're red and white,\" is the refrain from the Stretford End. There was red and white en masse but from the Basque Country.",
      "Athletic brought San Mames to the Old Trafford away end. Their stadium was billed as 'the cathedral of football' last week and on the day a plume of white smoke emanated from the Vatican, they sensed a miracle. They petered out after a game 72 minutes.",
      "Amid the rallying cries from the United followers, there were worried murmurs throughout the evening. United fans fretted over every loss of possession while the Athletic analysts in the press box constantly slumped in their seats at missed opportunities.",
      "The second half started so badly that Amorim was concerned enough to make three substitutions before the hour. That was in responde to United ceding the ball again. Athletic were without their top scorer, Oihan Sancet, again and the Williams brothers Nico and Inaki. The Williams sisters could cause this United side strife.",
      "Those proactive changes ended the threat of an Athletic recovery. Mount's first Old Trafford goal was reminiscent of Federico Macheda's swivel-and-shot at the Stretford End against Aston Villa 15 years earlier. It elicited nearly as loud a roar. That was checkmate.",
      "Mount's second, around 40 yards from goal with the net vacated by goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala, trumped his first. Nearly two years on from Mount's unveiling, the number seven shirt did not weigh as heavily as United racked up seven goals.",
      "Amorim will still be troubled by the first hour. He has to shoulder much of the responsibility for overloading the team with defensive players. That pragmatism in Bilbao was understandable as he played the percentages. In a home return leg, it sent out the wrong message.",
      "That was compounded by the wrong selection: Victor Lindelof. Amad has not started a game in three months but almost certainly will against West Ham on Sunday. Three days is not going to make a great deal of difference.",
      "Amad has to start not just at the weekend but against Chelsea next Friday to build him up for the final. Having been used on the wing at Brentford, he was one of the two playmakers against Athletic and that proximity to the goal was decisive.",
      "That throws up the dilemma of what to do with Alejandro Garnacho, a dogged deputy but not as reliable. His frivolous finish when one-on-one in the first half evoked memories of his impotence in such situations two years ago.",
      "Lindelof played United into trouble twice in the opening stages and his sloppiness became infectious. Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Harry Maguire, all decisive in Bilbao, regressed. Ugarte was such a liability he was removed in the first batch of substitutions in the 62nd minute.",
      "Casemiro, typically, rallied. It was fitting that a player who has reserved his standout form for the knockout stage nodded in the winning goal. Casemiro patted the United crest and was serenaded louder than ever at Old Trafford. He can be assured of another European final start after starting in four for Real Madrid.",
      "If United are often unrecognisable on European nights then their manager isn't. Amorim was furious with some early errors and quickly on his haunches, a signal he is anxious.",
      "Minutes into the second half, Amorim had to advise Andre Onana to float his goal kicks into the Athletic half. Providing pointers for a 29-year-old who is visibly prepared to assume responsibility in matches reflected terribly on the team's game management.",
      "In the stands, the night had some of the ambience and effort of Barcelona 2008. There was another tifo, more pyrotechnics and some fireworks, once more defying any lingering notion that United treat the Premier League and the Europa League equally. 'Take Me Home' will not be belted out with such fervent gusto before kick-off against West Ham.",
      "But it will be in Bilbao."

      "Mason Mount started and finished a spell of four goals in 18 minutes, scoring two outstanding efforts, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund also finding the net in front of the Stretford End.",
      "A result that flattered United means they will face Tottenham in the Europa League final back in Bilbao on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "A game-changer",
      "Amad had been on the pitch barely a minute when he produced United's best moment of what had been a dreadful second half until then. Exchanging passes with Patrick Dorgu, he drove into the area and immediately had Athletic on the back foot.",
      "His introduction, along with that of Luke Shaw and Mount, added some life into a poor United performance. It was Amad that did most of all to bring energy and invention to a sub-par display that had been wracked with nerves.",
      "Every time he got possession he looked to run at the defence and he helped to swing the momentum of the game. Until that point a second Athletic goal had looked far more likely.",
      "It was his run and ability to beat his man that led to the goal. He skinned Yuri Berchiche and although his cross was too high for Mount, the ball was kept alive and the goal came seconds later. He created United's third with a low pass for Hojlund to tap in and as they celebrated Hojlund pointed to Amad in front of the Stretford End. He has to start the final.",
      "Mount's smile",
      "Mount looked calm and composed after scoring a brilliant goal to settle this tie, but as he walked back from the Stretford End a smile as wide as United's 4-1 lead spread across his face and he couldn't resist punching the air.",
      "This was his third United goal but his first at Old Trafford. It was one he will never forget. There were obvious comparisons with Federico Macheda's goal against Aston Villa in 2008/09.",
      "It was a special moment and one richly deserved for a player who has already been through a lot at this club. There remains a feeling that he can really contribute to United, especially under Amorim, and this has been his best week since a £60million move from Chelsea.",
      "A familiar failing",
      "Amorim slapped his arms down to his side when Manuel Ugarte's poor pass out to Dorgu was intercepted by Andoni Gorosabel in the 20th minute at Old Trafford. It summed up a familiar failing for this team.",
      "The head coach has been repeating himself in recent weeks when asking for his team to start games better, but the message isn't getting through. He warned them of the storm likely to hit them in Bilbao but they were sluggish starters and lucky to be level after 20 minutes.",
      "Pre-match at Old Trafford, Amorim again said he hoped his team would deal with the start better. They didn't. Victor Lindelof was sloppy in possession, Ugarte gave the ball away a couple of times and Hojlund let one ball run out of play when he should have kept it in.",
      "United cannot keep making so many sloppy, simple mistakes in the early moments of games and expect to get away with it.",
      "Onana's kicking",
      "Andre Onana dealt well with two passes to him on his right foot in the opening exchanges at Old Trafford, then had a more routine clearance on his left foot and skied it into the air, barely clearing his own penalty area.",
      "Amorim shrugged his shoulders in disappointment at seeing the kick fail to ease the pressure on the United defence and it was another one of those moments that gives a voice to the idea that doubts persist over Onana's ability to maintain his place as the club's No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Onana blazed a free-kick straight out of play early in the second half, firing it in low, flat and hard and giving nobody a chance to get on the end of it. Amorim bellowed 'Andre' to get his attention and made a looping signal with his hand, telling him to float the free-kick in next time. This sort of stuff really shouldn't need explaining.",
      "His distribution was his super-strength at Inter and Ajax, but it's been inconsistent at United and isn't as much of an issue behind a back three anyway. He has steadied the ship after his Lyon nightmare, but the doubts won't go away.",
      "Turning the volume down",
      "With around 15 minutes until kick-off at Old Trafford, PA Alan Keegan turned the volume down so that the United fans could turn the volume up. The final song played before the music was cut was Bonnie Tyler's 'Heartache', which has been reworked by supporters as a song lauding Amorim.",
      "It is a ploy United have used occasionally in recent years and is an attempt to let the atmosphere speak for itself ahead of the biggest games. They don't come much bigger than a European semi-final second leg, even in the Europa League. The Stretford End responded and it was a crackling atmosphere pre-match, leading to the unveiling of another tifo in front of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand.",
      "Amorim had spoken ahead of kick-off about the support his team have had this season, referencing a 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford as an example of how the fans stay with the team.",
      "“For me, it’s more special: they were incredible against Bournemouth at home, Nottingham Forest at home,\" he said. \"The way they support us when we lose 3-0 at home, when we have back-to-back losses at home. These kinds of moments, they show this is a special club. They are special. We want to give something to them. Again, we want to win this also, for them.”"

      "With a full strength squad, Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu are Amorim's first-choices with Noussair Mazraoui, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass used when needed. However, there have been calls for United to go and sign a world-class, specialist wing-back to supplement Amorim's system.",
      "Dumfries, who was linked with a move to Old Trafford last summer - and before that even - is one of the very best wing-backs in European football and showed exactly what he is capable of in the Champions League semi-final. Of Inter's seven goals against Barcelona in the semi-final, he scored two and created three.",

      "Speaking on The Overlap, he said: \"Do you know what I kept thinking during the game? With the way Man United are playing with a back five and wing-backs under Ruben Amorim, I was thinking about that right wing-back.",

However, shortly after Mason Mount equalised with an impressive turn and finish, Prados was forced off the pitch due to injury.",

      "Instead, United have progressed to take on Tottenham Hotspur in an all-English Europa League final in the Basque Country. With the dust settling on the defeat, Athletic Club took to social media to provide an update on Prados and also suggest that the officials made a mistake during the game.",
      "They wrote in Basque and Spanish on Instagram: \"Benat Prados was only able to play ten minutes of the UEFA Europa League semi-final second leg against Manchester United. The Navarre midfielder received a hard tackle, which was not punished by the referee, which caused a bleeding wound on the front of his right leg.",

      "Simon Jordan has branded Gary Neville a “pest” and made a dig about David Beckham’s investment following the Manchester United icons’ Salford City takeover.",
      "Neville, who bought out the stake of former co-owner Peter Lim last year, has been involved with the Ammies since 2014 alongside fellow 'Class of 92' members, with Beckham getting involved five years later. The shares belonging to Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes have now been bought out by a new ownership group, which includes Neville, Beckham, former banker Lord Mervyn Davies and businessman Declan Kelly.",
      "Butt, Giggs, Phil Neville and Scholes all remain involved despite giving up their stakes in the club. Neville and Beckham have set the target of climbing to the Championship within five years, with the ultimate goal of reaching the Premier League.",
      "Reacting to the news, talkSPORT pundit Simon Jordan made a jibe about the pair’s alleged lack of financial involvement. The former Crystal Palace owner believes Neville and Beckham have been driven to action by Wrexham's success. Since being taken over by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, the Dragons have won three straight promotions.",
      "“They've got a window of opportunity because they've seen what Wrexham have done,” added Jordan. “They've seen the value of star power, and that value of star power has given revenues to Wrexham via Ryan Reynolds and the other fella. That's given them the resources to punch their way into the Championship.”",
      "Jordan went on to brand Neville a “pest” although he acknowledged the former England defender’s resourcefulness. He said: \"I find it very difficult to applaud Gary Neville on many things. I think he's a resourceful character.",
      "“If you've taken the task on, it's incumbent upon you - if you have a set of standards and you rate yourself, which most certainly he does - to produce an outcome that's meaningful.”",
      "Jordan added: “I don’t mind Neville, I just think he’s a bit of a pest. I think he has too much to say on other subjects that he’s not well-versed in, and he’s a hypocrite. But in the instance of Salford, it will be interesting… they’ve seen the Wrexham model. They should be saying, ‘Why can’t it be us?’”",
      "Beckham has admitted he is aspiring to lead Salford to the Premier League. He told The Athletic: “We’re definitely not doing it for a laugh and it’s also not for the romantic side of things. Yes, we care about the club but we’re doing it to win.",
      "“We want Salford to be successful and we have had success, but then we want it to go on to the next level. I always dream big so I’m always going to want us to get to the pinnacle of football and be in the Premier League. But there’s a lot of hard work and a lot of investment to be done up until that point.”"

      "Manchester United will meet Tottenham in the final of the Europa League on May 21.",
      "United secured their place in the final with a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night. Ruben Amorim's side kicked off the second leg of their semi-final tie with a 3-0 lead after goals from Bruno Fernandes (two) and Casemiro in Bilbao put them in a commanding position.",
      "The victory on Thursday night at Old Trafford meant the final aggregate score after the two-legged tie was 7-1 to United.",
      "Having seen off the La Liga outfit in the final four, United now know who they will be facing when they travel back to Bilbao for the final in just under two weeks' time.",
      "Spurs held a 3-1 lead going into the second leg of their semi-final with Bodo/Glimt. Goals from Dominic Solanke and Pedro Porro made sure they got the job done in Norway.",
      "United and Tottenham will now meet at the San Mames Stadium on May 21 with the winner being crowned Europa League champions.",
      "Not only will the winners of the final add a piece of silverware to their trophy cabinet, they will also secure that all important place in next season's Champions League.",
      "Despite being handed a potential Champions League lifeline, Amorim has been keen to stress that victory in the Europa League final would not paper over the cracks of what has been a dismal season.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\""

      "Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou has angrily responded to a question on whether winning the Europa League against Manchester United would save their season.",
      "Postecoglou's Spurs will face Ruben Amorim's United in the final of Europe's second-tier competition on Wednesday, May 21 (8pm kick-off) in Bilbao. Victory in Spain will seal a lucrative place in next season's Champions League for the winner.",
      "United saw off Athletic Bilbao 4-1 at Old Trafford in their second-leg fixture, 7-1 on aggregate, and will be seeking their second Europa League trophy win after emerging victorious in 2017 under Jose Mourinho. Tottenham, meanwhile, won 2-0 at Bodo/Glimt in their semi-final second-leg tie after a 3-1 victory in the first leg to put them on the cusp of a first major trophy win since the 2008 League Cup.",
      "But when it was pointed out to Postecoglou that United have acknowledged winning the Europa League would not save a disappointing season overall, the former Celtic boss could not hide his anger. \"Why do I care what Man Utd think?!\" he said in his post-match press conference on Thursday.",
      "\"Why is that relevant to me? OK, so ask the Man United manager why he says that. I've said all along that this is important.\"",
      "On the final, he said: \"It's going to upset a lot of people isn't it! The debate's now raging, the latest one is that neither of us will be able to get a trophy if we win, they're just going to take a team photo because we're not worthy.",
      "\"I mean, who cares if we're struggling in the league? Why is that important? If it's so easy to get to a final, then why doesn't everyone who finishes in the top three do it? It's a separate thing. It's got nothing to do with league form.",
      "\"We understand our league form hasn't been great. We understand the struggles we've had. A lot of them are because of the situation we've been in. But how does that diminish the achievement of getting to a final?",
      "\"Like I said, this club and others have finished in first, second or third in the Premier League, and haven't made finals. Why should that be diminished? I couldn't care less who's struggling and who's not.",
      "\"I think both us and Manchester United have earned the right to be there. I think we've probably beaten teams who will be in the Champions League next year, on our road to getting there. So looking forward to it, should be a great game.\""

      "Garnacho started the second leg of United’s Europa League semi-final against Athletic Club but was hooked on the hour mark with the Red Devils trailing 1-0 on the night, before a brilliant brace from Mason Mount and goals from Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund saw them storm back and claim a 7-1 aggregate win to set up a final with Tottenham.",
      "The 20-year-old has struggled through much of this campaign as he’s struggled to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s system, which sees him play a more central role in a 3-4-3 formation.",
      "He’s been heavily linked with an exit as a result and United are thought to be ready to listen to offers of £65m for the Argentina international, with Chelsea among those most interested in signing him.",
      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Scholes outlined his “fear” if United do sanction his departure from the club.",
      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "“I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.”",

      "“The problem is Ruben Amorim’s system suits No. 10s but he’s better on the wings running at people, he’s probably United’s best player at that.",
      "“I hope he stays. He’s too good to let go. I would never want the club to sell him. But the system is an issue because it doesn’t suit some of the players.”",
      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper. We said before the game he gets in brilliant positions, he is great at running through but a lot of the time he makes the wrong decision.”",

      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",

      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Including four Manchester United players, transfer expert David Ornstein has named 22 players ‘available’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "It promises to be a busy summer, with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all targeting a striker.",
      "Several strikers are being linked with moves to the Premier League, including RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Lille’s Jonathan David, while Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap are expected to join another English club.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",
      "However, they will need to sell players in order to buy, and Ornstein has stated that they have three players they could sell. Christian Eriksen will also be available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract.",
      "In addition to Eriksen, Ornstein mentions that on-loan stars Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are ‘available’.",
      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle and Man United are being strongly linked with the Cameroonian.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nWho will take a chance on Darwin, then? A Liverpool exit seems inevitable.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nOut of favour at Arsenal, who are addicted to signing left-backs under Mikel Arteta, Zinchenko will leave this summer and knowing the Gunners, they’ll get £5m for him and he will go on to be world-class elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nNewcastle tried and failed last summer. They should come back for him in June.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Jorrel Hato (Ajax), Mike Maignan (Milan) and Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nThe rest, I guess. The only surprise out of these four is AC Milan and France goalkeeper Maignan. He is club captain and his country’s long-term No. 1, but he is out of contract next year so the Italian giants could seek a fee this summer.",
      "Tah, meanwhile, is out of contract in 2025 and wanted by a host of clubs. The latest we have on Gittens is that Arsenal want him, and Hato is one of the most promising defenders in the world and wanted by every top club."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side.",

      "Rashford was dropped by Ruben Amorim for the Manchester derby in December and didn’t feature again for the Red Devils before a loan switch to Aston Villa in January.",
      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",
      "Rashford though has told Barcelona that he’s willing to take a significant pay-cut in order to make the move happen.",

      "‘His great goal is to try to play for Barça and his environment has already sent to the Blaugrana leaders that he is willing to lower his salary ostensibly so that the operation can be viable from an economic point of view. Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",
      "Rashford is said to have been keen on enlisting Zahavi to work on the move over his agent and brother, Dwaine Maynard,  because of Zahavi has a ‘good relationship with club president Joan Laporta’.",
      "Zahavi also represents both Hansi Flick and Robert Lewandowksi and has other ‘strong connections to the club’ that Rashford wants to take advantage of.",
      "It’s claimed ‘sources close to the player indicate early-stage talks have already begun ahead of the summer window’, but in what will be a significant blow to Manchester United, ‘a loan deal is seen as the most realistic path’.",
      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “All the players on loan will return, and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",
      "“The talent of Rashford, the talent of Antony, they all have talent. We are really happy because if you put players on loan, you want them to perform. That is good for us.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",

      "The Red Devils are well-placed to make more money on Greenwood as they have a 50% sell-on clause.",
      "It has been widely reported that the forward is attracting interest from other clubs ahead of this summer’s window, with it claimed Liverpool have made him their ‘top target’ to replace Darwin Nunez.",
      "Signing Greenwood would be a major risk for Premier League clubs as he comes with a lot of baggage and a report from TEAMTalk correspondent Fraser Fletcher claims Man Utd’s ‘hopes of a windfall are diminishing’ as a ‘return’ to England ‘has hit trouble’.",
      "TEAMTalk have ‘revealed Greenwood’s chances of moving to the Premier League in the summer transfer window’, with ‘it extremely unlikely that another club in the English top flight would sign him’.",
      "It is noted that ‘several Premier League clubs have privately expressed interest in signing Greenwood’, though ‘they are deterred by the significant public relations risks stemming from his past’.",
      "The report has also revealed the ‘most likely’ outcome for Greenwood this summer with Premier League rivals keen to avoid a ‘PR disaster’.",

      "Fixing Manchester United must appeal to new signings, while Trent Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool decision has reinforced the eternal No 1) on this ranking.",
      "",
      "20) Bournemouth\nBy making their unspoken role as a transfer stepping stone a part of their actual identity, Bournemouth have established themselves as a destination worth considering for any aspiring player.",
      "A self-described “platform club” who have proven capable of not only coaching and developing to an elite standard but also being willing to sell when the time is right is particularly appealing, not least to agents who might project bigger moves down the line.",
      "And there is an undeniable pull to working with Andoni Iraola, who could deliver European football next season and crucially stay for that part of an exciting journey.",
      "",
      "19) RB Leipzig\nIt is a similar situation at Leipzig, whose very purpose as the finishing school of the Red Bull institution is to polish the gems inherited elsewhere from within their multi-club ownership model and move them on to Europe’s elite for ludicrous profit.",
      "“We are confirming it every single summer in every transfer window, we are the perfect club for young players, to help them for a certain time in their career and then to bring them to absolutely top clubs,” said Leipzig managing director of sport Marcel Schafer last year.",
      "There is now also the remote prospect of at least entering the same orbit as that massive sell-out Jurgen Klopp.",
      "",
      "18) Spurs\nThe notion of a Big Six remains contentious for many but it has almost never been the actual best six because that isn’t the point.",
      "The crisis baton is passed and often shared between Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, whose competence levels have rarely converged over the last decade. Yet they remain far and away the richest clubs in the Premier League with the clearest in-built advantages. Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",
      "Their shift towards a focus on signing younger talents and helping them evolve is also enticing, although the managerial situation will need to be clarified soon. With that said, as naive, foolish and prickly as Ange Postecoglou can be, his philosophy has proved compelling to players at a base level.",
      "",

      "But an exception could be made for Gian Piero Gasperini if the one-year option in his deal is triggered and his spell at Atalanta is taken into a tenth year next season. Their rise under his guidance from mid-table fodder to title challengers and even Europa League winners playing some of the most exciting, admirable football on the continent has been stunning.",

      "16) Juventus\nThere is no better place to go in Italy if money is a driving factor, with Juventus claiming the highest wage bill in Serie A. But the Old Lady has shown her age somewhat in these fallow post-Scudetto years, being overtaken by a handful of clubs run more capably.",
      "This remains a team in transition, with uncertainty over their manager, sporting director and a transfer policy still contingent on player churn and loans with various clauses attached.",

      "14) Newcastle United\nThere is an undoubted upward trajectory to Newcastle which could prove impossible to resist for any player who wishes to be part of something meaningful – and financially lucrative.",
      "It is easy and indeed often necessary to challenge the perception of Newcastle as unique in their football-obsessive nature, but also Dan Burn will probably have a trophy outside St James’ Park when all is said and done and he just scored in a Carabao Cup final; imagine how the player who delivers a Premier League title or European glory will be celebrated and commemorated.",
      "Newcastle do not feel far off becoming frequent Champions League qualifiers and an established domestic force, with regular loads of sportswashing capable of reinforcing that position once they finally get there.",
      "",
      "13) Atletico Madrid\nThere’s no shame in Atletico having basically one trump card to play that no other team can boast. Diego Simeone is their ace, their only feasible edge in any transfer race competed on even footing against other Champions League regulars. And he is going nowhere, probably even when Arsenal come calling.",

      "12) Napoli\nThe lure of sitting under the Scott McTominay learning tree cannot be sniffed at but there is a definite elephant in the room when it comes to Napoli’s transfer lure.",
      "Antonio Conte is simultaneously their biggest pull and most prominent red flag for prospective signings. Napoli are on course to win Serie A for the second time in three seasons but with a managerial ticking time bomb liable to go off any time soon, and the volatile Aurelio De Laurentiis still in a position of power, it would be a risk to join even with their renewed offering of Champions League football.",
      "",
      "11) Manchester United\nDo not underestimate the allure of being the player who can rouse a sleeping giant. Manchester United could do worse than making it part of their negotiation pitch that incoming signings might be the one player who can fix them. Bruno Fernandes committing the best years of his career to a certified basket case proves it can work.",
      "Things have obviously changed since Robinho was caught off-guard by the revelation that there were two Premier League clubs based in Manchester, and United have been drowned out by many more teams than their noisy neighbours.",
      "But they can still genuinely compete with the best in the transfer market in spite of their own failings, and if more than a decade of general irrelevancy has done little to change that then nothing will.",
      "",
      "10) Borussia Dortmund\nThe established cliche used to be that Bayern would sign the best players from Dortmund, who in turn would shop in the smaller Bundesliga markets. But it doesn’t really apply anymore, with free agent Raphael Guerreiro the only player since 2016 to cross the divide and leave Germany’s second-biggest fish for the bona fide shark.",
      "Dortmund cannot even lay consistent claim to being the country’s perennial bridesmaid. They have finished 3rd, 4th or 5th as often as they have 2nd in the last eight Bundesliga seasons, and are currently losing the fight to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "They are still Dortmund and the idea of following in the footsteps of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham works in their favour. But the further smaller those examples in the rear window, the better chance Leverkusen have of usurping them.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea\n“I don’t why as a player I would look at that Chelsea project and think I would sign,” said Jamie Carragher last August. But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",
      "",
      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, it ultimately tends to come down to money and Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta. It happened again in Paris.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against them might soon be erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory has haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They have tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and very likely ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "And transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "The 28-year-old has a release clause of just €20m (£17m) which applies to foreign clubs, and Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb has confirmed the Red Devils’ interest while revealing the club’s owner, Urbana Cairo, is now in a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes for the goalkeeper to sign a new deal at the club.",
      "‘The Red Devils, in fact, carried out the first surveys, well aware that in the Serbian contract there is a clause of around 20 million euros valid only for abroad.",
      "‘That’s why President Cairo wants to sit around the table with Milinkovic-Savic as soon as possible: the goal is to find a new agreement to remove, or at least raise it to higher figures, this sword of Damocles.’",
      "The report offers United a boost in their bid to sign Milinkovic-Savic by revealing that Torino are currently looking at options to replace the 6ft 8in star, including former Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius, whose Schalke contract expires this summer, and Sampdoria’s Jonathan Klinsmann.",
      "Chelsea and Manchester United have also been credited with interest, but United may hold the advantage having signed Milinkovic-Savic back in 2014, only for the then teenager to be released due to a work permit issue."

      "Garnacho has been linked with a move to Chelsea or Napoli this summer after both clubs showed previous interest in the forward, with United reportedly demanding at least £65million for the 20-year-old.",
      "Responding to the reports ahead of his side’s crunch clash against Athletic Club in the Europa League, Garnacho said: “Obviously as a footballer you read and listen to some rumours about the future, but I have a contract here until 2028. I am happy here.",
      "“We know we have to work hard here to be even in the squad and I just have to train well every day and I will be available for all the games.”",

      "Erik ten Hag was replaced by Amorim in November but the results and performances have if anything deteriorated following the Portuguese manager’s arrival.",
      "Amorim has stuck rigidly to his philosophy and Garnacho has been one of many players who have struggled to adapt.",
      "“I think it’s difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation,” Garnancho explained. “But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "“Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "“It’s a little bit hard but it’s just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.”",

      "With the Argentina international not celebrating his birthday until July, there’s every chance he can equal or even surpass the United legend, but Garnacho insists he’s only focused on improving to help his team.",
      "But, for now, Garnacho is concentrating on the here and now, as United prepare for the Europa League second leg against Athletic Club at Old Trafford.",
      "“I’m not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano played here, he was a different footballer, [they were] a different type of games,” he said, at Wednesday’s press conference. “I just try to help the team and try to win games.",
      "“Obviously, yeah, on missed chances and things like this, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus [Hojlund] and all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and we will try to do better.”",
      "United won their first leg 3-0 in Bilbao and have a great chance of reaching the Europa League final and Garnacho says he’s working hard with Hojlund – who’s been particularly poor in front of goal this season – to improve their output.",
      "“I speak with him a lot. We try to help each other,” he added. “Sometimes, from this side, it’s difficult but we try hard, try harder every game to try to score more of these chances, and the team will improve if we score more goals.",
      "“We know that we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. But the manager said before that we have followed the rules and tomorrow is a final, and we will face it like it is 0-0.",

      "We haven’t updated the manager rankings for a bit, so we’re sneaking a quick update – you know, just the 7000 or so words – before doing a full and proper job on it when the season ends.",
      "It is, of course, the most scientific and rigorous of endeavours so if you find yourself disagreeing with anyone’s placing simply know and understand you just aren’t as clever as the supercomputer we pumped full of data to deliver results absolutely none of which are as silly as when we accidentally had Kieran McKenna seventh last time.",
      "You can read that malfunction and the rest of the last update here if you absolutely must, but the TL;DR placings are in the brackets below.",
      "",
      "30) Erik Ten Hag, Man United August-October (28)\nShould obviously have been sacked in the summer, could very easily have been sacked after either of the two grimmest thrashings – Liverpool and Spurs – and arguably most compellingly of all should have gone after trying to convince himself and the world that a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was evidence of anything much at all about his future prospects.",
      "As we said after he was eventually put out of our collective misery last year:",
      "As is very often the case for a flailing manager – especially at the biggest clubs – he is not really the biggest problem but nor does he show any hint of being in any way part of a possible solution.",
      "The football is uninspiring and, much as we hate the phrase, increasingly small time. Ten Hag’s confidence has shrunk to the point that he no longer feels able to take his team to a place like Aston Villa and do anything more than cling grimly to the 0-0 he started with.",
      "There are teams where you can justifiably point to hard-earned, backs-to-the-wall goalless draws at Crystal Palace and Aston Villa as evidence that you know what you are doing and are going to get the job done, but Manchester United surely cannot ever be one of those clubs.",
      "The irony, of course, is that a man who spent a large part of the second half of his United managerial career desperately insisting that results be ignored finally did get the tin-tack after a result that on its own probably could have been ignored.",
      "Given the chances United missed – Diogo Dalot’s in particular was one for the all-time list and probably not really Ten Hag’s fault if we’re being fair about it – and the genuine absurdity of the penalty that eventually settled it, there is a strong case to be made that West Ham 2-1 Man United is the most easily dismissed result in the Premier League since Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool.",
      "It wasn’t quite as abysmal a bit of officiating as that one, but it was arguably worse because a) it came so late in the piece and b) represented VAR actively changing a perfectly fine decision rather than a failure – however ludicrous – to overturn an error that already existed.",
      "But when you have somehow come out the other side of at least four clear sacking windows as Ten Hag so obviously had, the sympathy that exists for getting the boot during an altogether more opaque one can only be very limited indeed. He had to go, and even United’s struggles to adapt to life under Ruben Amorim don’t really offer much vindication for Ten Hag given that so much of that struggle is down to the squad rot – both in personnel and mindset – that was allowed to fester during his time.",
      "",
      "29) Ivan Juric, Southampton, December-April (27)\nBeing both appointed and sacked by two clubs during one season is novel, even for a manager who has now had nine managerial jobs and lasted less than 50 games in seven of them, including all three of his spells as Genoa manager between June 2016 and December 2018.",
      "No wonder he had itchy feet after three whole seasons at Torino, who he left last summer before taking over at Roma in September, being sacked in November, then taking over at Southampton in December before again being sacked in April. Slightly disappointing he hasn’t managed to squeeze in another job in Italy before the season finishes, if we’re being brutally honest.",
      "His Southampton reign was a failure, obviously. But it didn’t have to be quite so hefty a failure, surely. Not managing to save them from themselves is one thing, being really no better than Martin in any significantly measurable way and statistically inferior to Simon Rusk, the caretaker who preceded and followed him, is not a good look.",
      "",
      "28) Russell Martin, Southampton, August-November (26)\nYou can’t blame a guy for trying, can you? Having sat and watched Vincent Kompany brazenly and above all successfully place his own career prospects several levels above Burnley’s survival prospects last season, you can forgive Russell Martin for wanting a slice of that pie having surprised many by steering Southampton back to the top flight.",
      "The problem is that Southampton were even less suited to trying to Pepball their way around the Barclays than Burnley. Burnley had at least cruised through the Championship in dominant fashion; Southampton scraped up through the play-offs after an end to the season in which even a relegation-haunted Huddersfield had scared the living sh*t out of them.",
      "And lo it came to pass that Southampton were not capable of passing Premier League sides to death. There is a wider point here about wanting to do this.",
      "It’s something that now-established teams like Brighton and Brentford didn’t do when they first came up. They showed the Barclays some damn respect. These days everyone wants everything instantly, and these teams and managers think they can just saunter on in here and started passing out from the back from day one.",
      "The utter and total failure of Southampton and Martin, who we fear remains unlikely to be the next manager of Bayern Munich despite his impeccable credentials, should at least serve as a warning to others.",

      "27) Julen Lopetegui, West Ham August-January (25)\nGetting rid of David Moyes in the hope of finding something a bit more proactive and enjoyable and then replacing him with the Spanish Moyes was always an interesting choice from a club that deals almost exclusively in interesting choices, but it’s still been striking to watch just how badly it’s gone and in such Moyesian fashion.",
      "The worst of Moyes’ West Ham were so, so similar to the worst of Lopetegui’s: unnecessarily painful to watch given the talent available, but also and more damningly utterly ineffectively painful to watch. The 4-1 defeat at Man City was the ninth league game out of 20 this season in which the Hammers had conceded at least three goals.",
      "It could only ever end one way, and given how bad West Ham have been you do almost have to hand it to the way the people running that club managed to make Lopetegui look like a wounded victim by making such a complete bollocks of his very necessary departure. Sacking managers is part of the game, but you can still do it with some dignity and grace.",
      "Making the poor sod take training on the morning of a day he knows is going to be his last was just deeply weird, deeply unpleasant behaviour. It makes no sense unless viewed as some kind of desperate ploy to enrage Lopetegui to the point that he might jump before they had to push him.",

      "25) Gary O’Neil, Wolves, August-December (23)\nAn apparent recovery on the back of two straight wins and a four-game unbeaten run in October and November crashed and burned spectacularly as Wolves lost three straight games, one of which involved the genuinely weirdly impressive achievement of conceding four goals to Everton.",
      "O’Neil’s job was very much on the line ahead of a home game with Ipswich, one that ended with a late winner for Wolves’ relegation rivals and star man Matheus Cunha getting fisty with stewards. So, on balance, a sub-optimal run of form and antics. It felt like the end. It was the end.",
      "And now we don’t really know what happens next for O’Neil. He’s a man who has now completed two genuinely impressive firefighting jobs from hospital passes (need a police reference here really don’t we, but buggered if we can think of one) at first Bournemouth and then Wolves. But having been replaced to such great effect at Bournemouth by Andoni Iraola and now having made a right bollocks of things at Wolves after his first stab at an actual pre-season of proper preparation he might just be a bit stuck.",
      "To make matters worse, he has now been even more swiftly and conspicuously outperformed by his replacement at Molineux than he was at the Vitality.",
      "There are presumably two kinds of jobs that now exist for O’Neil’s next foray. One, another desperate Premier League club enlists his proven relegation-avoiding credentials but that means waiting until someone like West Ham sh*t themselves with panic in around October.",
      "Two, and perhaps more likely, an upwardly-mobile ambitious Championship club tasks him with doing the ‘getting into the Premier League’ bit before his specialist subject of ‘staying in the Premier League’, which is now so difficult for promoted clubs that it is essentially witchcraft.",

      "Manchester United haven’t got much right this year, but appointing a bona-fide club legend as interim manager to chuck in a few mood-boosting results before swiftly and correctly replacing him before it all went horribly sour – as all manner of subsequent evidence suggests it absolutely and entirely would have – suggests that at least someone somewhere at that daft club learned something from the Solskjaer years.",
      "One of the main reasons to doubt the sustainability of Van Nistelrooy’s United bounce was the fact that two of his four games and two of his three wins came against Leicester.",
      "This appears to have been a factor in Leicester’s decision to appoint him manager. Which at first glance appears understandable but only gets more weird the more you think about it. Why appoint a manager based on the fact he has proved he can beat you, when that is the one thing he can never, ever do in the job you’ve just given him?",
      "Although, we guess, actually he kind of did. He oversaw two games in which United beat Leicester while he was United boss, and then did the same again as Leicester boss. We should have expected no different.",
      "Hard to see him staying on for the attempt to get Leicester back into the Premier League next year, but if he does walk away he does so as the proud owner of one of the more compelling examples of The Joke Is Always On Spurs.",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s effort was so long and repetitive that even Stewart Lee might have rejected it, with 15 defeats scattered either side of Leicester’s 2-1 win at Spurs. After the two goals early in the second half of that one they abandoned goalscoring altogether for more than two months.",
      "That 16-match, four-months-in-the-making joke is also bookended by a pair of 2-2 draws with Brighton, which means that, we guess, the joke is also always a tiny bit on Brighton for some reason. Maybe needs some more digging, that one.",

      "Current Sack Race favourite and you have to say that’s fair enough. There really isn’t any compelling excuse for Everton to be slumming it like this in a grimly miserable relegation scrap again, and if Dyche cannot build a coherent case that he’s the best man to keep them above the relegation waterline, then really what is the point?",
      "The belligerent run of spoiling draws against City, Arsenal and Chelsea is starting to look more and more like a defiant but futile last hurrah for Dyche’s particular brand of misery with Everton increasingly inclined to look elsewhere for a manager who might do more than drag them a point above the relegation zone with such misery-inducing football. Feels like for a club of Everton’s history and stature you might be able to get away with flirting with relegation and you might be able to get away with football that makes the ears bleed, but you can only do both for so long before it just becomes demeaning for all concerned.",
      "Everton finally losing their long and proudly-held top-tier record the precise moment they move into a shiny new stadium is just far too Everton a piece of behaviour to be ruled out, and it does look more and more like it might need a change of direction, a change of mood, and a change of manager to prevent that nightmare scenario becoming horrifyingly real.",
      "What Everton have subsequently achieved under David Moyes – even if the new manager bounce has inevitably lost a bit of air from its glorious early days – damns Dyche further.",

He was gone within days, with nobody much happy with the sufferball on offer even though it was keeping Leicester very much afloat in a choppy and complicated relegation fight.",
      "The timing of his dismissal was odd, coming as it did after a narrow defeat to Chelsea straight after the international break that rather indicated he was already done for and a new manager could have been given a bit more time during that break to get his feet under the desk.",
      "All became clearer, mind, when Ruud van Nistelrooy – who only completed his interim duties at Manchester United at said international break – was the man anointed as the saviour of Leicester’s season just after inflicting a couple of sizeable blows upon it with the Foxes’ relegation rivals United.",
      "It went… poorly.",
      "",
      "21) Graham Potter, West Ham, January onwards (15)\nFeels like a much better post-Moyes fit for the Hammers than Julen Lopetegui ever did, and we retain hope that it will all work out in the end. But uncomfortably and unavoidably true it is not working out currently for a team whose current eight-game run without a win includes the twin embarrassments of home draws against both Southampton and a barely-interested Spurs.",
      "Potter should be better than this. West Ham should be better than this. They are currently just about the only team really giving the incoming promoted sides hope that the story of the last couple of seasons can change.",
      "And that’s a pretty embarrassing state of affairs for both club and manager. The start of a season is obviously always important for all sorts of managers for all sorts of reasons, but those early weeks of next season right now feel more important for Potter than anyone else in this league.",

A giddiness that we are now attributing to a desperate desire for at least one of the promoted trio to give survival a real shot. Even back in January it was clear Ipswich offered the best/only hope of that, but they too have ultimately come up well short.",
      "It does feel like over the season as a whole they have been more consistently more competitive than the other two, and unlike both Leicester and Southampton there is a decent body of evidence to go with a gut feel that they still have the right man in charge to try and earn them another chance back in the top flight next season.",

      "It’s not to say it wouldn’t be a huge achievement – and Spurs’ recent performances in the latter stages of the competition have been pretty compelling – and it would absolutely be a huge deal for Spurs as a whole.",
      "But could it or should it save Postecoglou? We’re really not sure it should. If the Europa League efforts offer some mitigation for both the poor recent league results and the shoddiness of the returns during their injury crisis, they also damn Postecoglou as well.",
      "Because it should never have got that bad during the injury problems and it should never have remained this bad when the injured players returned, Europa distractions or no Europa distractions.",
      "There’s also the sticky issue of how and why he’s been able to coax such whole-hearted performances out of this squad on Europa League nights but not in the Premier League.",
      "United and Spurs have probably benefited from the presence of each other in the same unexpected area of the league table this season, each serving to normalise the ridiculousness of the other.",
      "But it is Postecoglou who has less excuse for being there. He’s in the second full season of his plan, and the fact a 17th-place finish remains entirely possible is a stain that not even winning the Europa could or should wash away entirely.",
      "Tottenham’s league form has now been absolutely rotten for a strikingly long time; since the heady days of those first 10 games of last season in which Ange’s swashbucklers picked up eight wins and two draws they’ve managed only 78 points from 63 games, very nearly half of which have been lost.",
      "To put that in full perspective; those first 10 games of last season still account for a quarter of all Postecoglou’s Premier League points. Even including that run with its eight wins and no defeats he has still has just as many losses as wins in the Premier League.",
      "Winning the Europa League might still save his job for now, especially with Spurs’ much-discussed record when it comes to such things, but we will be staggered if he starts 2026 as Spurs manager.",

      "18) Ruben Amorim, Manchester United, November onwards (18)\nThe pure absurdity of the Europa League run is doing a lot of heavy lifting and the fact we’ve now reached the point where United winning it and thus securing a third silverware-winning season in a row despite being increasingly dreadful has just about tipped over from possibility to probability is absolutely wild.",
      "But this remains one of the most clear-cut cautionary tales this division has ever served up. Man United got it wrong last summer and Amorim got it wrong in failing to call United’s bluff when they insisted it was now or never in November. He should have stayed with Sporting like he wanted to, and backed himself to have opportunities at least as good as this one – even very probably this precise one – come the summer.",
      "He could also absolutely have shown at least hints of flexibility in acknowledging the squad was not up to the challenge of what he would be demanding.",
      "It’s not his fault that United’s squad was left technically, physically and mentally weak by previous managers and regimes, but it is still his fault that he didn’t recognise that at the outset or accept the reality of it during the season.",
      "The sheer incompetence of the teams below United has prevented things becoming even worse, but his Premier League record is miserable and it’s going to take one heck of a summer to offer any meaningful resolution. The full rebuild required is going to take at least a couple more windows beyond that.",
      "The Europa League run has been spectacularly entertaining throughout, but the starkest of facts is in that league form. United have won only twice since January, against Ipswich and Leicester. If next season begins anything like the way this one is ending, Amorim will be in big trouble very quickly and that silverware will not save him.",

      "15) Mikel Arteta, Arsenal (13)\nThis is going to be a season that contains all manner of awkward questions that will require addressing. Especially when it’s a season that carries still the prospect of Arsenal finishing third (or worse…) in a two-horse race and having to watch all the clubs joining them in the Champions League next season win silverware.",

      "It doesn’t spell the end of Arteta by any stretch, and we’ve talked before about just how hard it is to put together three title-challenging seasons in a row. It might well be that this was always Arsenal’s fallow season and it’s just the inadequacy of others that kept them artificially and deceptively high in the table.",
      "But there has been a clear regression in their league form, with a lack of the clinical ability to get the job done that marked them out as the real deal in the second half of last season. Points have been frittered carelessly and consistently with the injury problems providing at best partial mitigation only.",
      "It all makes next season feel like a decisive one for Arteta and his – still worth remembering, this – enormously ambitious plan to restore Arsenal to the summit of English football after a couple of decades away.",

If we were going to have a four-match reign as Manchester United manager, what we’d do is to make sure that all four of those matches were at home and, ideally, two of them against Leicester and another against PAOK in the Europa League. Get some lovely fat wins under the belt.",
      "But let’s not pretend United would have won those three games as straightforwardly under Erik Ten Hag (or, it must now be conceded, Ruben Amorim) as they did under Ruud. It’s not really Ten Hag’s fault, but everything had become extremely stressful by that point. Absolutely nothing was coming easily, and maybe one of those three games might have been straightforward. But at least one would have been harrowing.",
      "And perhaps the most impressive result of Van Nistelrooy’s reign was the one game he didn’t win, with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea giving us far more information than some easy wins over dreck.",
      "Essentially, though, it was the perfect interim stint. It’s had all the positives of the initial Ole caretaker spell, with the instant mood-lifting morale boost of seeing a bona fide club legend in the hotseat, without any of the unpleasantness of mistakenly leaving him there for another two years after that initial buzz had entirely worn off.",

      "13) Oliver Glasner, Crystal Palace (14)\nA curious Premier League season in which Glasner’s side won none of their first eight games and now none of their most recent five means that they might somehow still fall short of that apparently impenetrable 50-point mark despite a run of 34 points in 17 games between December and early April. They now need a ticklish four points from games against Tottenham, Wolves and Liverpool if they are to raise their bat.",

      "11) Pep Guardiola, Man City (16)\nExtremely plausible that this season now ends with a second-place league finish and a trophy. Which would be one heck of an outcome for a season that flirted for a serious amount of time with genuine disaster.",
      "At their lowest pre-Christmas ebb, City and Guardiola both appeared broken in a way that was dizzyingly unfixable. We’re still not truly convinced he’s fully recovered despite the improvement of results trending back towards something approaching City normality over recent months.",
      "We still feel like this is a season that has pushed him closer to the City exit door rather than convinced him he should hang around to build a new team to go again against Liverpool and Arsenal and whoever else can manage to put together more than a half-season’s worth of results.",
      "The impending departure of Kevin De Bruyne means the loss of another key stabilising, familiar reference point in Guardiola’s City adventure, and for so many reasons next season feels like one that holds more uncertainty for City than just about any other during his outrageously successful reign.",

      "At the very least it appeared certain they faced another agonising end to the season in which relegation if it was to be averted would only be dismissed as a prospect late in the season.",
      "Instead it was pretty much off the table by mid-February with Everton instead allowed to spend the last few months giving their grand old ground the proper farewell it deserves without any of those intrusive thoughts about the worst-case scenario.",
      "Even if the highs of those early weeks have faded slightly among a flurry of draws – it’s now six and a solitary win in Everton’s last 10 games – the key work for this season at least had been done.",
      "Now, of course, for the next step. There is no plausible Everton manager more deserving, more worthy of taking them into their new life at their new ground. No manager who could more fully understand everything it means.",

      "",
      "9) Thomas Frank, Brentford (9)\nFrank is going to remain a top-10 staple for just about any next manager market worth the trouble but we remain entirely wedded to the idea that this is a club and manager in perfect harmony and the idea of either party risking their serendipitous relationship on something flashier is fraught with danger.",
      "It’s probably inevitable at some point, but it’s not something we like to think too hard about. In keeping with the other teams currently jockeying for positions 8 to 11 in the final table, it feels like theirs has been a season that doesn’t really deserve a bottom-half finish even though the cruel reality of maths demand that be somebody’s fate when the music stops.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca, Chelsea (5)\nIt’s not perhaps a satisfactory conclusion, but the one we find ourselves drawing is that Chelsea is simply a place where stuff happens and these days the manager is as much a passenger or bystander as anyone else.",
      "It doesn’t quite seem fair to heap either praise or derision on the fella trying to steer a course through the season at a club that spends so lavishly yet haphazardly.",
      "Maresca has made many mistakes, as a man with his lack of top-level experience was always likely to, but he’s got a lot right as well.",
      "And the fact that when the Champions League spot they had pretty much held all season came under pressure they have responded with a run of 20 points in nine games while remaining on track in the Conference isn’t to be sniffed at.",
      "In summary: Maresca is neither as good as his best nor as bad as his worst. Nothing means anything. It’s all just a bunch of stuff that happened.",

      "But it does now look like another mid-table finish for a club and manager that have finished 10th and 13th in the last two years. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that and none of the teams promoted since Fulham were joined by Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest two years has managed anything like it, but finishing 11th would now represent something of a disappointment given where they were and what seemed possible not that long ago.",
      "",
      "6) Unai Emery, Aston Villa (6)\nA tricky one now. Has that PSR-baiting January window been justified by what’s followed? This has been a season that has delivered memories for a lifetime, with Villa’s run to the Champions League quarter-finals an eye-catching one that remained thrilling to the very last moment.",
      "Villa fans have seen things they could surely never have expected to see at Villa Park with Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford combining to give the club a hefty nudge into the second half of the season.",
      "But the likelihood now is that they will finish the season outside even the expanded Champions League places, without the silverware that other similarly equipped clubs will have to show for the campaign and with a sense that what they’ve built this season has been done ever so slightly on sand.",
      "That thumping defeat in the FA Cup semi-final is a really bruising one for Villa. And the way their season ends, with games against Tottenham and Man United, feels strangely apt too. Both clubs will offer a reminder that things could be so much worse, but one will also awkwardly show how things could also have ended up so much better.",
      "",
      "5) Andoni Iraola, Bournemouth (4)\nWe are acutely aware that there is little more annoying to fans of ‘smaller’ clubs than constant media narratives about anyone doing well with them heading off to one of the ‘bigger’ clubs. You only have to look at how upset Liverpool fans are about Trent Alexander-Arnold right now to see that.",
      "We take no joy in prodding at that sore spot and therefore apologise in advance here, but… of all the managers currently overperforming as manager of one of the Premier League’s burgeoning ‘middle-class’ clubs Iraola is the one we’d most like to see take the step up soon.",
      "Because we’re pretty sure he’s the most interesting. We’re pretty sure he’s the one with the greatest variety of possible outcomes.",
      "Placed in charge of one of the bigger beasts might bring the best or worst elements of his work to the surface. Or they might just continue to co-exist as they do now, only with attention shifting inevitably and inexorably to the dodgier parts.",
      "He’s been Bournemouth manager for two years now, and across that time they have almost always resembled either a team that could and should challenge for Europe or one that could and should be battling relegation. There is very little middle-ground.",
      "This is a team that completed a league double over Arsenal yet lost at home to Ipswich. A team that beat Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in successive weeks by an aggregate score of 9-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to 11 Premier League games and yet two months later found themselves on a run of one win (against Southampton…) in their next eight.",
      "In the last month alone they have suffered such embarrassments as failing to beat either West Ham or Man United, yet gone to the Emirates and prevailed.",
      "Their last three matches are against Aston Villa, Man City and Leicester and absolutely any result feels as likely as any other in any of those matches.",
      "And all of that is broadly fine at Bournemouth but brings a fascinating and chaotic dynamic to any club higher up the food chain.",
      "Essentially our point with Iraola is this: the exact season he’s produced for Bournemouth to great acclaim this season would be considered among the Spursiest things ever recorded if he were to repeat it at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next season.",
      "For his own sanity and career he should not take that job, but we can’t help wondering what goes off if he does.",

      "That start – nine points from the first 16 games of the season – ensured Wolves would be the last team to successfully extract themselves from the biggest non-event in Premier League relegation fight history, but when it happened it happened with absurd speed.",
      "It’s entirely true that Wolves’ squad is not one that should have been in the mess that it was, but nor was it one that could have been expected to so adroitly streak not just clear of the relegation zone but beyond the lower-mid-table stragglers like United, Spurs, Everton and West Ham into comfy mid-table.",

      "",
      "3) Eddie Howe, Newcastle (3)\nIn terms of neatly and effectively meeting a pre-season brief, there’s a strong argument that nobody can match Howe’s achievements this season with Newcastle. Sure, others have more obviously obliterated pre-season targets in thoroughly dramatic fashion, but we’re not sure anyone has taken the two obvious top objectives for a team this season and delivered in the manner of Newcastle.",
      "Back in the Champions League and ending English football’s most ridiculous trophy drought is special, special stuff. Sure, the wider media reaction to Newcastle winning the Carabao might have been too saccharine for most tastes, at times giving the impression that Newcastle had invented winning a trophy after not doing so for ages, at others journalists who have apparently never met a single real-life actual football fan expressing bafflement that all supporters of all clubs weren’t all overjoyed and thrilled about it.",
      "This generally took the form of ‘you just don’t understand what it means’ when the truth was ‘we all understand exactly what it means, we just don’t care as much as Newcastle fans do about it’. This really should be straightforward. Should, say, Tottenham win the Europa League there will be no equivalent media outpouring, no suggestion that if you aren’t as thrilled as Tottenham fans about it all that you simply don’t understand.",
      "So, to be clear: nobody is unclear about the scale and significance of that achievement for Eddie Howe and his team. Not least because even the standard ‘only a Carabao’ barbs struggle to land even more when you consider Newcastle’s run to that trophy.",
      "They took down four of the current top seven en route to glory, thoroughly outclassing Arsenal over two legs in the semi-final and then schooling Liverpool in the final.",
      "One can argue that those clubs had larger primary targets but neither was exactly phoning it in by that stage of the tournament either. And Newcastle beat them up.",
      "The final in particular was a spectacular performance and a huge personal triumph for Howe, who set his team up perfectly to nullify Liverpool’s huge threat at one end without ever curtailing their own attacking capabilities.",
      "The players delivered wonderfully, but this did feel like the manager’s success every bit as much. And for a manager with obvious talent but so little experience of such major finals, that was doubly impressive.",
      "Throw in the now very likely success of goal two – getting back in the Champions League – and you’ve got a manager who in any normal season would be a worthy favourite for manager of the year but in this one finds himself scrapping just to stay on the podium.",
      "",
      "2) Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest (1)\nThere’s a risk that they might be running out of steam at just the wrong time, that a seemingly rock-solid grip on Champions League football might be lost on the run-in.",
      "Forest have won only twice since March in a run that has seen them slip to sixth in the league and go out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage.",
      "And those two wins have been against Manchester United and Tottenham, and at this stage those barely count.",
      "But while we remain keen advocates of the idea that goals change across a season and relative failure can and should often still just be considered failure given the scale of the opportunity being passed up, sometimes you do have to step back and accept that ‘Nottingham Forest only finishing sixth’ would have been a simply batshit sentence to utter in August.",
      "And even more so when Nuno, his reputation in this country in tatters after The Tottenham Unpleasantness, took over a club mired in points deductions and facing relegation.",
      "Two wins at the back end of last season, against the even more stricken Sheffield United and Burnley, were enough to keep Forest up and they have taken that and run with it in remarkable fashion.",
      "Sure, there’s no doubt they’ve been assisted by an unusually high number of big clubs having absolute daftnesses, but they’ve still been hugely impressive.",
      "Forest are not a complicated team to understand, but that’s praiseworthy in itself. They know what they are, what their strengths are and how to get the absolute most out of that more often than not.",
      "Smart recruitment and canny coaching has produced a team more than the sum of its parts, and that’s really all anyone can reasonably ask any manager to produce in what is still less only a season and a half in charge.",
      "",
      "1) Arne Slot, Liverpool (2)\nIt’s very unfair but also true: it has ultimately proved quite hard not to end up using the sheer ease with which Slot has cracked the Premier League puzzle at the first attempt as a counter-intuitive caveat against his achievements this season.",
      "If anything, Clive, he’s almost won his first Premier League title too well.",
      "We’re guilty of it. We still don’t see Slot becoming the next great legacy manager, the next man to put together an era of dominance containing a string of league title a la Ferguson or Guardiola.",
      "We still can’t entirely shake the notion that this has all in some way been a last hurrah for Jurgen Klopp and his team rather than the start of something magical.",
      "And there’s every chance that is going to be made to look like utter foolishness.",
      "Nevertheless, a big part of why Slot’s impact and success might not be quite as hailed as it ought to be is that it’s been so obviously coming for so long that the failure to add any burnishing additional silverware feels vaguely disappointing because human brains are daft things that operate daftly.",
      "What he’s achieved has been staggering, and the easiest and fairest way to measure that is not to simply look just how far clear Liverpool have ended the season – because that really can end up working against them – but where everyone had them finishing when the season began.",
      "They fell away from the title race just as it really got going last season, and few were backing them to match even that under a new manager working largely with the squad he inherited.",
      "It’s been repeatedly and correctly pointed out that Klopp left a very decent squad – albeit one with a few huge contractual roadblocks in the very near distance – but still nobody outside stopped-clock ‘our year’ Liverpool fans really saw this coming.",
      "Just the simple fact the machinations around the Contract Three have never had any dread impact on the field is impressive. And, yes, getting Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah to be really good is a little bit ‘I told him to do that’ but there have been plenty of new managers before who have come into a settled and successful dressing room and not achieved the level of buy-in from those players to new methods and new ways of doing things.",
      "Still, though, it remains the remodelled midfield that stands as Slot’s greatest achievement. He has elevated Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai to new levels. Each of them had obvious class before this season, but none had shown such a high level for such a sustained period in this league.",
      "It’s not hard to picture plenty of other higher profile managers coming in and finding those the available resources and spending six months whinging about it.",
      "Slot was having none of that, and really has felt like the absolutely ideal kind of coach to come in and take what was already there and provide the small tweaks here and adjustments there to make something even better.",
      "He has, in short, proved the ideal man to finish a necessary rebuild about which Klopp correctly deduced two things. One, that it had to happen but two, that he himself no longer retained the requisite energy to deliver it.",
      "Saying farewell to Klopp was hard, but he knew precisely what he was doing and Liverpool have already reaped the benefits of that.",
      "",
      "Carragher claims Arteta currently sounds more like a ‘social media fan’ than Arsenal manager after his recent complaints about Liverpool and PSG.",
      "There is a ‘lack of manliness’ at Arsenal which could cost Mikel Arteta his job by the end of the year. That ‘headless chicken’ Declan Rice needs to do more.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Did Arsenal make a ‘sack decision’ on Mikel Arteta within an hour of the final whistle in Paris? It seems unlikely.",
      "Is the ‘public glee’ at Arsenal’s defeat to PSG down to their manager Arteta and his nonsense excuses? The Gunners boss is ‘openly disliked by staff’.",
      "Presenter Gary Lineker has suggested that Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta’s decision against Paris Saint-Germain proves he doesn’t trust one of his players."

      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",

      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",
      "Mount had never scored for United at Old Trafford before this game, his only previous goals for the club coming at Brentford. These two were special, the first because of its importance in the moment and the second enough to light up any evening.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult at the beginning of the game. Getting that goal to make it 1-1 calmed us down. It's been too long [since I had a feeling like this]. I just tried to come on and affect the game.",

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund speaking about his team-mate:",
      "\"I am very pleased for Mason Mount, he is one of my very good friends in this team. He is a good lad, always working very hard.",
      "\"He has been getting a lot of stick because he had a lot of injuries, but he has been positive and trying to get fit all the time.",
      "\"He has only had one goal, that was to get back on the pitch. He did what he did today, we knew he had the quality. It was just about the time.\"",
      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",

      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Thursday 8 May 2025 23:33, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Aston Villa are a cracking bet to beat Bournemouth.",
      "Fulham have had a strange season.",
      "Marco Silva has got the maximum out of this squad but they've left so many points on the table against the lesser teams in the Premier League. They've won just four of their 13 games against teams in the bottom seven, which makes them easy to swerve here at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "When it comes to the reliability factor, Everton aren't great shakes either, racking up a Premier League high of 15 draws this season. The record for draws in a 38-game season is 17 and they may take one step closer to that in this one.",
      "No Premier League team has won more away points (19) or scored more away goals (18) than Brentford in 2025.",
      "Thomas Frank's side are brimming with confidence and cohesion, and have only lost on one of their last nine Premier League away days.",
      "This is an obvious opportunity for them to stretch that run further and keep up hope of an eighth-place finish, which would be enough for a Conference League spot if Manchester City win the FA Cup. Can they be trusted at such short odds at 4/6 with Sky Bet?",
      "I'd rather play a bigger price and just back Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo both to record a goal or an assist, where you can get 11/8 with Sky Bet. If you calculate their goal involvements this season then Mbeumo and Wissa have 45 between them. A phenomenal record.",
      "If Southampton can only generate 0.5 worth of expected goals and allow Leicester to beat them to nil then what chance have they got facing a footballing machine like City? Saints remain the lowest scorers in the English leagues with just 25 goals, and City's defence has developed a snarl in recent weeks. It's much more secure, with the Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol axis impressing.",
      "Man City to win to nil is 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The player-to-be-fouled market offered by Sky Bet is quickly becoming one of my favourite markets. There is lots of value to be had there if you can find the right match-up or latch onto a developing fouls trend in the market that has gone unnoticed by the traders.",
      "The player on my radar here is Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke. He's been fouled 15 times in his last nine starts and has been fouled in every single one of those games.",
      "So those backing him to be fouled one or more times in the last nine games have landed nine winners - a 100 per cent strike rate. His fouls lines are extra juicy here based on his direct opponent in Jorgen Strand Larsen, as the centre forward is a big fouls-committed merchant, making 19 in his last eight games.",
      "Van Hecke is 13/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled two or more times.",
      "Bournemouth have won just one of their last six Premier League home games and the underlying numbers have followed suit in terms of decline. Over the first nine home games this season, their expected-goals data was working at 1.96 per 90, but over the last six, it's down to 1.29. Meanwhile, their expected-goals-against data has taken a whack too. That's gone from 0.9 per 90 to 1.68 per 90 in the last six home games.",
      "The blueprint to stop Bournemouth is something Unai Emery has been implementing against Andoni raola before Iraola-ball was even a thing in the UK - since the Villa boss was manager of Villarreal, in fact. He knows exactly how Bournemouth are going to set up and he's going to implement his plan to stop them - like he has done in every meeting with Iraola before.",
      "Emery has won three and drawn two of the five meetings between the pair. He can lead Villa to an important win at 17/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Lots being on the line, added to two teams who know how to mix it, means this should be a full-blooded affair. They've already played one another twice this season and there's been 15 cards shown in total, so there is spice potential.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season. A huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Vardy will be relishing this occasion.",
      "He needs just one goal to reach 200 for Leicester and you can see him doing it at the City Ground, with perhaps a prepared shirt underneath celebrating the milestone.",
      "He's in the shop window too, isn't he? Strikers don't come more motivated when trying to play for a next contract so he's going to be doing his upmost to grab the limelight.",
      "\"Who cares if we've struggled in the league?\" beamed Ange Postecoglou after going to the Arctic Circle and getting the job done in impressive fashion on Thursday night. Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at PSG.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",

      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",

      "",
      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",
      "Jones slipped in the build-up to Chelsea's first, Elliott was hauled off after the Blues' second - and Endo showed he, at 32, will struggle to replicate what Ryan Gravenberch did brilliantly all season.",
      "At the top end of the pitch, Diogo Jota was anonymous with just 13 touches - he has one league goal in 2025 - while Darwin Nunez missed two good openings after coming on. At least he managed one more touch than Jota.",
      "None had a worse outing though than Jarell Quansah, with one own goal and one penalty conceded in a disappointing and unconvincing display at centre-half, one that was reminiscent of his opening-day struggles at Ipswich.",
      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",
      "And with Kostas Tsimikas failing to ease Liverpool's left-back woes, that looks like four areas Liverpool could strengthen this summer. Left-back, centre-back, midfield and striker - and don't forget a right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold departs, as expected.Sam Blitz",
      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"
