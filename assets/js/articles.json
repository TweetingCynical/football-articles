      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker have doubts over whether Senne Lammens can handle the pressure cooker environment at Manchester United. The Belgian shot-stopper arrived at Old Trafford from Royal Antwerp in an £18.2million deadline day deal.",
      "It comes after question marks emerged over Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir's capabilities between the sticks. Bayindir faced fierce criticism following a blunder that handed Arsenal a 1-0 victory over United at Old Trafford in their seasonal opener.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will be hoping for a fresh start with a new No. 1, but Lineker and Shearer remain unconvinced that the 23-year-old is the solution to their problems.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Lineker said: \"Manchester United have brought in a goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, from Royal Antwerp, who apparently made more saves than any other goalkeeper last season. That doesn't always mean what it sounds like it means; they might have just been a bad team at Royal Antwerp.\"",
      "Shearer added: \"Young for the situation that he has to go into. If he's going to go straight in there, that's going to be a big ask for him. What happened to the Emi Martinez deal? I don't know because he didn't play the other night, did he?",
      "\"Obviously, he didn't get the move that he wanted. So that's going to be a big ask for a young goalkeeper to go in there and start and perform.\"",
      "Lammens shipped 32 goals across 30 outings in Belgium's top flight for Royal Antwerp last season, managing an impressive seven clean sheets during the campaign. He was also crowned the division's Player of the Month twice and made 173 stops throughout the term - more than any other keeper across Europe's leading 10 leagues.",
      "After their opening day defeat to Arsenal, Amorim told reporters: \"I'm happy with the three goalkeepers. He [Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed. That is my feeling when I see the play.",
      "\"You choose to push a player [out of the way] or to get the ball in that moment. He needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass.\"",
      "However, as the transfer deadline loomed, it appeared that the powers that be at Old Trafford had a change of heart, setting their sights on Aston Villa shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez. Despite the 32-year-old making his desire to join the Red Devils known, the board chose instead to sign Lammens, who is nine years younger than the Argentine.",
      "The Manchester United faithful will have to bide their time before they see Lammens in action, given that the Premier League is currently taking a breather for an international break. Supporters may, however, catch a glimpse of what the new face can do when the Manchester derby kicks off at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, 14 September.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The EFL have confirmed Grimsby Town will face Sheffield Wednesday in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, September 16 at 7.45pm - after Manchester United elected NOT to appeal against the Mariners punishment for fielding an ineligible player.",
      "United were dramatically dumped out of the competition last Wednesday after a penalty shootout defeat to the League Two side, following a thrilling 2-2 draw at Blundell Park. Grimsby raced into a 2-0 lead before Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire struck back for the Reds, forcing the tie to penalties.",
      "In a nail-biting finish, Grimsby held their nerve to triumph 12-11 from the spot. United's £71m new boy Mbeumo missed the crucial 26th penalty to send the underdogs through to the next stage.",
      "Controversy arose on Tuesday morning when it was revealed that the EFL had slapped Grimsby with a £20,000 fine for fielding an ineligible player during the match. Clarke Oduor, ironically the only Mariner to miss his penalty, was not properly registered for the contest. Grimsby had missed the window to register Oduor by a minute, and duly self-reported themselves, admitting a clerical error by the club.",
      "Following Grimsby's punishment from the EFL, the club released a statement: \"Grimsby Town Football Club acknowledges today's decision by the EFL regarding an error in the registration of Clarke Oduor ahead of our Carabao Cup Round Two fixture against Manchester United,\" the announcement began.",
      "Oduor's registration was lodged with the EFL one minute beyond the deadline and the problem wasn't spotted straight away by the club due to a technical issue being encountered at Grimsby.",
      "\"We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the importance of adhering to competition rules and regulations. This mistake was not deliberate - and the club acted transparently by self-reporting that breach as soon as it came to light.",
      "\"Since this incident, we have undertaken a thorough review of our processes and implemented strengthened measures to ensure it cannot happen again. We thank the EFL board for recognising our co-operation and intent, and we remain fully committed to maintaining the highest professional and regulatory standards.",
      "\"The club won't make any further comment on the matter and now looks forward to focusing on preparations for our upcoming fixtures.\"",
      "Grimsby are duly required to pay half of the fine immediately, with the remaining £10,000 suspended until the end of the season. The EFL, not as severe as the FA in such issues, have not considered a replay or indeed an expulsion.",

      "Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller marvelled at Florian Wirtz's transfer to Liverpool this summer as he admitted he is intrigued by the prospect of a move away from the Bundesliga.",
      "The Germany international was linked to Manchester United and Real Madrid in recent months. Ruben Amorim's side had a central midfielder among their priorities to sign in the transfer window but failed to get one over the line.",
      "The 24-year-old Stiller remained with Stuttgart, while his team saw the exit of former team-mate Nick Woltemade to Newcastle United. Stiller remains under contract until 2028 having made his name at the club after failing to break through at Bayern Munich, before moving to Hoffenheim.",
      "A return to Bayern is not on the agenda for Stiller at this stage of his career. Indeed the four-times capped star was not interested in a transfer at all during the most recent window.",
      "Instead Stiller's ambition is centred around playing enough football to earn a place in Germany's World Cup squad next summer. The player is in Julian Nagelsmann's current selection for qualifiers against Slovakia and Northern Ireland.",
      "\"I'm not currently thinking about moving,\" Stiller told Sport Bild. \"I've discussed it with my management that this is out of the question for me right now",
      "\"I'm a regular and leading player here. The most important thing for my development is that I get my minutes — especially in a World Cup year. I definitely didn't want to jeopardize the World Cup.\"",
      "The player was impressed by his international team-mate's blockbuster summer transfer however. Wirtz joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen in a British record deal, until the Reds surpassed the figure when signing Alexander Isak.",
      "\"Basically, I'm attracted to moving abroad at some point; I thought Florian Wirtz's decision to go to Liverpool was cool,\" Stiller acknowledged.",
      "Reports suggest the Stuttgart star has a clause in his contract that would permit him to leave for in the region of £35m. And Stiller does have an eye on one move in the future, though not one that will prick the ears of Europe's elite.",
      "The Germany ace would like a late-career move to thee United States. \"One thing is clear to me,\" he said. At the end of my career, I absolutely want to play in the USA, in the MLS. This plan, this goal, is 100 per cent.\"",

      "Sekou Kone received glowing reviews from Manchester United U21 boss Travis Binnion after just three appearances for the club's academy. The 19-year-old was snapped up in a £1million transfer from Guidars FC last summer, and it didn't take long for him to leave his mark in the Under-21s setup.",
      "Despite Kone missing out on academy-level pre-season preparations and being given time to find his feet before being thrown into action, Binnion was upbeat in his evaluation of the teenager once he stepped onto the pitch.",
      "Discussing Kone with the MEN last November following a match against Huddersfield Town's senior squad, Binnion said: \"He's a high potential player, there's no doubt about that. His games to this point have been 20 minutes at Sunderland in a game we were poor in, 45 minutes in a game where we were completely dominant in Under-19s.",
      "\"To have his third game and his first start tonight, at that level, I thought for 20 minutes he was excellent. Then they get a little bit of pressure on him, it gets a little bit harder, it just shows he is learning where he's at and it's no problem.",
      "\"He's shown more than enough in the three games to suggest that with time and with work he's got a real chance of being a really good player, but it's a high potential Under-21s player with first-team potential, I don't think we can get too ahead of ourselves.",
      "\"He's come off injured tonight so will have to see the severity of that. He needs to get fit, stay fit, get a run of training and games and then we'll where he's at.",
      "\"It's just playing games, seeing pre-match and post-match sessions, analysis, translating them. You can see he can play the game and he's got real ability, it's just a run now and consistency and letting him learn and develop at his own rate.\"",
      "Meanwhile, MUFC TV pundit Liam Bradford likened the defensive midfielder to Kobbie Mainoo earlier this year, saying: \"He's quite similar to Kobbie Mainoo in that he can receive the ball in tight areas and get out of danger with a quick turn.",
      "\"He's having an impact all over the pitch, Sekou Kone. He's making an impact and stepping up in attack and defence.\"",
      "Fast forward to September 2025, and Kone has gained invaluable experience training with the United first-team, but Binnion believes that academy games are where the young talent will truly shine. Earlier this year, he said: \"A lot of [academy] players train with the first-team a lot because they're further along in their development. He does train with the first-team, but he needs to make sure he's developing his own game, so when he goes full time with the first-team, he's in the right space.\"",
      "Despite a challenging season last term, which saw Manchester United finish in 15th place in the Premier League, there's hope on the horizon for Ruben Amorim's side. The Red Devils were linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba over the summer, but his £100m price tag proved too steep, especially after the board had already spent £200m on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, it seems United may already have their future midfield stars waiting in the wings, thanks to their renowned academy system. Youngster Mainoo has been turning heads since making his full Premier League debut under Erik ten Hag in November 2023, despite this summer's travails, and Kone could also be one to watch if he continues to develop at his current pace.",
      "However, Kone suffered a setback last month when he fractured his eye socket during an Under-21s match against National League side Tamworth. The injury led to him being stretchered off and hospitalised, and it's still unclear when he'll be able to return to the pitch.",
      "But if he can bounce back from this injury and continue to impress at academy level, he could find himself playing sporadically for the United first-team as early as this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "TalkSport's Jason Cundy is the latest person to call for Grimsby to be thrown out of the Carabao Cup for fielding an ineligible player during their historic win over Manchester United - but doesn't think the Red Devils should be reinstated.",
      "The League Two outfit enjoyed one of the best nights in their history as they stunned the Premier League giants, eventually winning 12-11 on penalties having led 2-0 earlier in the contest. However, a registration error surrounding Clarke Oduor has landed the Mariners in hot water.",
      "But rather than being kicked out of the competition they've been handed a fine and will be allowed to compete in the third round, where they face Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "Darren Bent is among those to call for Grimsby to be kicked out of the competition, claiming that if Oduor contributed in any way to halting United's ambitions, they should be punished. He said: \"You have to question Grimsby's place in the competition.\"",
      "Now Cundy has taken a similar stance and maintained that rules need to be adhered to - but that United should not get a reprieve with Sheffield Wednesday instead getting safe passage to the next round.",
      "He said: \"First off, if you break the rules like that I don't see how Grimsby can be in the competition, I genuinely don't. It sounds harsh but if that had happened the other way round, would we say 'nah its fine, £20,000 fine for Man Utd'. Are we now judging it by the lcub? they broke the rules, I'm sorry ,you have to leave the competition.",
      "\"I don't think Man Utd should get in either by the way. They got knocked out. What should happen now, whoever they're facing, they should get a bye. Grimsby should not be in the competition, if there's a law it should be the same for everyone.\"",
      "He went on to add: \"Sorry this sounds very harsh, but there's laws and rules for a reason, and if you break those the punishment has to be. We've just seen what happened with Crystal Palace.\"",
      "Oduor signed for Grimsby on loan from Bradford City the day before the match. He made his debut after coming on as a substitute during the second half, but would miss in the shootout, albeit it didn't cost his new side.",
      "It later emerged that he was registered just a minute after the permitted 12pm deadline on August 26. In a statement, the EFL has admitted that Grimsby reported the error themselves, and explained the punishment for the League Two side, which hasn't been universally well received by everyone.",
      "They said in a statement: \"The Club has since implemented several actions to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. The Club will be liable for the suspended sum of £10,000, if they were to again field an ineligible player in any League Competition between now and the end of Season 2025/26.\"",

      "Manchester United have signed a “huge talent” in Senne Lammens, according to Real Madrid and Belgium star Thibaut Courtois. Lammens became the Red Devils’ final signing of the transfer window on deadline day as he completed an £18m switch to Old Trafford from Royal Antwerp.",
      "United chose to pursue the 23-year-old to bolster their goalkeeping department over Aston Villa and Argentina star Emi Martinez. Despite that decision, one man who is a big fan of Lammens is Courtois, who has already shared his thoughts on the move with Rio Ferdinand.",
      "Speaking on YouTube, the United legend said: “He let me know about Lammens because he's a Belgian player, and he was just giving me the heads up as to what he's like.",
      "“He said he's a huge talent, obviously not experienced yet but he thinks his style will be well-suited to the Premier League as well. So that's a recommendation from probably one of the best three goalkeepers in the world, Thibaut Courtois, so I'll take that.”",
      "And while Courtois is a big fan, Ferdinand has concerns that Lammens might not be given the time he needs to reach his top form at Old Trafford. He added: “I keep seeing people talk about the talent and whatnot, but the problem is, can Man United afford to wait for talent to develop at this point in time? That's the question.”",
      "At just 23, Lammens has already made 63 appearances for Royal Antwerp and has worked his way up through the Belgian youth ranks - albeit he has yet to make his senior debut.",
      "Explaining why he chose to move to Old Trafford, he said: “This is my dream move. When I was five, United was at the height of football and you keep in your memory how big Manchester United is, so, when I heard they were interested, it was like a childhood dream.",
      "“I remember being a kid, Manchester United winning the Champions League and winning the league, and also [I want] to help the team get to a level that you can compete for a title again and to play Champions League again. That’s also one of my biggest points, that I want to grow with the team and go up to the heights that used to be Manchester United.",
      "“It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and the Premier League is the biggest competition in the world.",
      "“In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.",
      "\"It’s crazy. So, that was also a big part of why I chose Manchester United. I’m very happy that we could get it done today.”",

      "Paul Scholes overlooked Liverpool as he named Gianluigi Donnarumma to Manchester City as the standout signing of the transfer window. The Italy goalkeeper has joined Pep Guardiola’s side for a seemingly modest fee of around £27million, having fallen out of favour at European champion Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Liverpool were the biggest spenders of the summer window, lavishing a record £446m on an array of talent such as Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike. But it was the transfer of Donnarumma that caught the eye of Manchester United legend Scholes.",
      "The co-owner of League Two Salford City took to Instagram to post a picture of Donnarumma following his City move and wrote: “Donnarumma for £26m surely has to be signing of the window… obviously apart from the 14 Salford City have signed [praying emoji].”",
      "Given United’s goalkeeping issues, with Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir both making shaky starts to the season, Scholes wishes his former club had signed Donnarumma, who had been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but they signed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp instead.",
      "However, he believes it is a “strange signing” for Guardiola, who likes his keepers to be good with the ball at their feet. Scholes told The Overlap: “I think that’s a really strange signing for Pep. I love the keeper [Donnarumma], I think he’s brilliant and I’d have him at United tomorrow, today, whenever.",
      "“For £40m [the previously reported price for Donnrumma], he’s unbelievable. But for Pep, you’ve got to almost be able to play in central midfield as a goalkeeper.",
      "“I think that’s the reason [Luis] Enrique is getting rid of him at PSG, because he’s not great with his feet. I just don’t see him as a City goalkeeper.”",
      "Donnarumma replaces Ederson, who has left for Turkish side Fenerbahce after eight years at the Etihad. The 26-year-old said: “To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me.",
      "“I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by the one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola. This is a club every player in world football would love to join.",
      "“I have admired watching Manchester City for many years, so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege. I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates, the staff and the fans.",
      "“Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.”",
      "Donnarumma is set to displace James Trafford, who has started City’s first three matches of the season, two of which have ended in defeat. He could even make his debut in the Manchester derby at the Etihad on Sunday, September 14.",

      "Sancho has followed in Rashford's footsteps by securing a season-long loan switch to Aston Villa, with Rashford having spent the second half of last campaign at Villa Park.",
      "Villa have agreed to pay 80% of Sancho's salary, though the arrangement includes achievable bonuses which should see his full wages covered during his stint in Birmingham. Sancho referenced Rashford when he was officially presented at Villa.",
      "He said: \"I spoke to him while he was here last season and I know he really enjoyed it. He said so many lovely things about the club, like how it's a family and you feel that friendly environment with great players and staff. I definitely felt that as I came in.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Tyrell Malacia were also strongly linked with late summer window departures but will now remain at United for the present. The latter saw a loan move to Elche fall through, though could still be shifted with the transfer windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia remaining open.",
      "Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez was also seriously considered by United as a goalkeeping option, with the World Cup winner even omitted from Unai Emery's squad to face Crystal Palace on Sunday evening.",
      "Nevertheless, the club chose Lammens. A late bid for Atletico Madrid and England midfielder Conor Gallagher also failed to come to fruition for United. Amorim's men have made a sluggish start to the season, but will take some consolation from Cunha's bright performances and Mbeumo netting his first goal at the weekend.",

      "The transfer window is closed but that doesn't mean Premier League clubs can't still strike deals with the several free agents still on the market.",
      "A frantic deadline day meant that a number of clubs were able to plug gaps in their squad. The likes of Newcastle, Aston Villa and Manchester United all secured new arrivals that will aid problem areas, although there are still calls for Ruben Amorim to bolster his midfield. Others, namely Liverpool, further strengthened.",
      "Any major deals will now have to wait until January, but a number of players are without clubs and can secure themselves a new home anytime now. Owing largely to their contracts expiring, several individuals will be seeking to prove that they can still cut it.",
      "Even after three Premier League games it is abundantly clear that some clubs have issues in their squad that look set to remain until they get bodies through the door. That could motivate them to hand out, even a short-term contract, to see if they can get some serious value for money.",
      "It is easy to dismiss free agents, especially those who still don't have clubs, as players who are simply surplus or past their best. But that is not always the case with personal circumstances or a desire to find the right environment meaning they still don't have an employers.",
      "The midfielder was integral in Burnley getting promoted back to the Premier League last season, but the 29-year-old immediately set his sights on something new. Brownhill scored 18 times for the Clarets, but when confirming his exit at the expiry of his contract he claimed it was the \"right time for me to start the next part of my journey in football\". He rejected a move to Leicester on deadline day with Saudi clubs still keen, but the midfielder looked like he could comfortably do a job in the top flight.",
      "His CV includes over a decade at Arsenal and Liverpool, including Premier League and Champions League winner's medals, but the Englishman is back on the market after leaving Besiktas.",
      "Injuries have plagued him throughout his career yet Oxlade-Chamberlain would still have a lot to offer. Birmingham have been heavily linked as they push for the Premier League, but anyone with more than 300 top flight appearances who is just 32 represents great value.",
      "The Bosnian has been a key figure at Roma, Juventus and Barcelona and whilst he's 35, experience still counts for a lot. Any team looking for legs in the middle of the pitch is unlikely to find that by signing Pjanic, but look no further if they want a general who is able to allow his brain to excel whilst age continues to take its toll. His stint with CSKA Moscow has just ended and he's never tried his hand at the Premier League, which could prove tempting.",
      "Truly, we never saw the player that lit it up for Ajax when he did move to Chelsea, but he played in a congested environment where he was rarely made to feel like he had the backing of the manager, nor was his spot ever truly nailed down.",
      "Loan moves never properly worked out but the Moroccan is still in his early 30s and his left foot has produced some highlight reel-worthy moments. The most prolific season of his career saw him score 22 times.",
      "Still just 27, he was part of the exciting Norwich side that gained promotion under Daniel Farke with his performances later earning him a switch to Newcastle. He fell down the pecking order at St James' Park and had to head out on loan to get minutes, spending last season with Sao Paulo in Brazil. Lewis' contract expired in the summer and he's on the market with the full-back still possessing his pace if a team is willing to take a punt on him.",
      "The French defender has left West Ham after spending last season on loan in Saudi Arabia. At his peak he was a hugely influential figure and his physicality and athleticism made him a stellar centre-half and he played for the Hammers as they claimed Europa Conference League glory. Zouma is still only 30, which is often entering the peak years for a defender, which could see a Premier League club make an approach.",

      "Manchester United previously explored the possibility of bringing Danny Welbeck back to Old Trafford - only for Sir Jim Ratcliffe to come in and curtail the deal amid fears of the striker's age.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with a number of strikers this summer, eventually landing Benjamin Sesko, but they also gave serious thought to signing a second forward which led to their interest in Welbeck, who is one of their academy products.",
      "Erik ten Hag was keen on the veteran striker 12 months ago when he was still at the club, but issues at board level meant the deal couldn't get done. And again in 2025, the former England international was under consideration after missing out on Liam Delap, who instead joined Chelsea.",
      "United felt bringing Welbeck back to the club would add some vital experience and allow for another body who knew the club's DNA.",
      "But it was the Ineos chief who had reservations over his age profile. Now 35, Ratcliffe did not want to hand out a two-year deal, reports the Athletic. Instead a one year, plus another possible year, was discussed but never formalised or put to Brighton. No fee was agreed either.",
      "Welbeck has a contract at the Amex Stadium until 2027 and top scored last year. He's shown no desire to leave and would've been a back up option in Manchester as they overhaul the look of their frontline with Rasmus Hojlund leaving.",
      "Wayne Rooney played with Welbeck during his time in Manchester and has since seen him continue to produce despite not being a headline name. It was last season that he pitched the idea of his former club going back after the player they let go for just £16million in 2015.",
      "He told the BBC: \"Danny, he's great to play alongside and if I'm being completely honest, I'd would probably still like to see him here playing for Manchester United. He scored goals throughout his career, had injuries in early part of his career, but seems to have got over them and he's having a fantastic season.\"",
      "Welbeck came through the ranks in Manchester, enjoying loan spells away, before he was given first-team opportunities in the final years of Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure. His most prolific season saw him score 12 times in all competitions.",
      "The striker was far from the most fashionable name however, but since being allowed to move on he's scored numerous times against the Red Devils. He knocked them out of the FA Cup with Arsenal and has downed them several times with Brighton.",

      "Liverpool have left a target on their backs after breaking the British transfer window twice in the space of a few weeks. That's no guarantee of success, though - as Manchester United found out back in the 2001-02 season.",
      "Premier League champions Liverpool looked to cement their place at the top by clinching a record-breaking move for Florian Wirtz in July, paying up to £116million for the German international. That record didn't last long, though, with Alexander Isak finally getting his Anfield move in a £125m deadline day deal.",
      "Back in 2001, United were also reigning champions. Sir Alex Ferguson's side had finished 10 points clear of closest challengers Arsenal, but eight league defeats and a Champions League quarter-final elimination left the Scottish manager determined to strengthen.",
      "First came Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had been due to join United earlier only for injury to get in the way. The £19m paid by the Red Devils broke the £18m record set by Leeds the previous year when they signed Rio Ferdinand from West Ham.",
      "Van Nistelrooy only held the record for 11 days, though. That's when United threw £28.1m at Lazio for Juan Sebastian Veron - the player who was meant to solve their European problems as they looked to add to their 1999 Champions League final victory.",
      "To say the two signings had mixed fortunes would be fair. Van Nistelrooy ended the season as United's top scorer and would end up with 150 goals in all competitions across five seasons at Old Trafford, but had just one league title and a pair of domestic cup wins to show for it.",
      "Veron, meanwhile, was never able to repeat his Serie A form in the Premier League. His two-year spell wasn't as bad as some have made it out to be, but United nonetheless cut their losses with a £15m sale to Chelsea in 2003.",
      "United themselves set a precedent Liverpool won't want to repeat. Ferguson's team only finished three points worse off than in their 2000-01 title-winning campaign, but that saw them drop from first to third as Arsenal won the title and Liverpool leapfrogged United into second after winning their last two games.",
      "They responded to that setback by, you guessed it, breaking the record again. The summer 2022 move for Rio Ferdinand was un unquestionable success, though, with the centre-back winning six Premier Leagues and one Champions League during more than a decade at Old Trafford.",
      "Liverpool have made a fast start in their own title defence, though there have been a few questions asked of Arne Slot's side despite three wins from three in the league. Wirtz hasn't shown himself to be a Premier League superstar overnight, but perhaps he'll benefit from that record price tag no longer hanging over his head after six long weeks.",

      "Erik ten Hag was humiliated by Bayer Leverkusen staff, who claimed he was one of their worst managers in the last 20 years before his shock sacking by the Bundesliga club.",
      "The former Manchester United coach was given just three games in charge of Leverkusen before they decided to swing the axe.",
      "There have been reports Ten Hag had fallen out with the hierarchy amid tension over signings and the direction of the club, with sporting director Simon Rolfes admitting chiefs couldn't see the relationship working any longer.",
      "Ten Hag had taken over from the successful Xabi Alonso this summer following his departure to Real Madrid but a difficult start to pre-season saw a host of key players sold - including Florian Wirtz, Jonathan Tah, Jeremie Frimpong, Piero Hincapie and Granit Xhaka.",
      "The Dutchman also accused his players of being unfit, despite presiding over the entire pre-season and had a poor first two Bundesliga games. He lost the first 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim and drew the second 3-3 against ten-man Werder Bremen despite having a two-goal lead.",
      "A report from Bild has claimed that long-serving members of staff had mocked Ten Hag by debating him among the worst managers in the club's history. It adds that the former Ajax boss was \"in a top ranking for the overall package\".",
      "Such was the ill feeling towards Ten Hag around the club, the report says it could be argued that Leverkusen had \"perhaps waited too long\" in sacking him. The tell-tale signs against Ten Hag were there early on, it says. The coach had \"failed to convey any ideas\" to the team and \"no one knew what to do\" - even when they had been 3-1 up against Werder Bremen.",
      "It adds that his relationships with staff and players were \"strained\" and \"he couldn't connect with anyone\". There was also surprise when Ten Hag decided not to give a speech ahead of their opening game of the season against Hoffenheim.",
      "There were also clear signs of tensions over transfers after Ten Hag criticised the club for selling so many crucial players and said he would not allow Xhaka to be sold to Sunderland. The Swiss star eventually got his move as Leverkusen ignored his protests. Later, Leverkusen signed Lucas Vazquez from Real Madrid without consulting Ten Hag, who only greeted the player after his contract was already signed.",
      "Rolfes conceded hiring Ten Hag was a mistake but said it would have been an even worse mistake to keep him in charge.",
      "\"From the impressions from preseason, from the first games, we had the feeling that we had to do it now,\" the former Leverkusen midfielder said. \"You can make bad decisions, but if you then believe you've reached the point where it can't work in the future, it's an even bigger mistake to let it continue.\"",
      "Ten Hag had previously hit out at his \"unprecedented\" sacking, saying in a statement: “A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play. I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret.",

      "Paul Scholes has accused Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim of being too honest for his own good.",
      "United boss Amorim gave an emotional and blunt interview in the wake of his side's shock EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby last week. Amorim said his players “spoke really loudly about what they want” with their woeful display, which United legend Scholes said was a mistake to say.",
      "“I quite like Amorim,” said Scholes. “He's very honest and can be too honest. He's saying what every manager probably thinks at some point, but I don’t think you say that out loud.",
      "“There are so many experienced managers in the Premier League who will be thinking that, and I’ve thought that, but they won’t say it.",
      "“The worst comment for me was after the Grimsby game, where he said that the players spoke out loud – I thought that was a little bit damning for him.",
      "Asked what he felt Amorim meant, Scholes said: “That the players don’t want to play for him.\"",
      "Ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said: “The problem with Amorim is that he’s great in the press conferences but because he’s not winning, people are thinking, ‘Oh, shut up. Stop speaking.’ But if he was winning, we’d all be thinking he’s a great character and personality.",
      "“If he wasn’t so charismatic in the press conference, and wasn’t such a good-looking man, he might have lost his job a lot earlier. When you look at the results, they are horrendous.”",
      "Scholes also claimed United had messed up in the transfer window by failing to address their midfield, which he claimed was a priority to strengthen.",
      "“We talk about recruitment and United haven’t addressed the areas which needed addressing,” said Scholes. “They needed to address the midfield – the legs were never in there.",
      "“Amorim has got four or five midfield players, and he wants to play two of them, but he can’t get it right, he can’t get the combination right.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Daily Mirror Manchester Football Correspondent, covering Manchester United and Manchester City. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "Only Manchester United could close what had been a successful transfer window with a signing that poses more questions than answers.",
      "Having recruited proven Premier League attackers in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and a promising young striker in Benjamin Sesko, United could consider the window a triumph, particularly as they also managed to offload most of Ruben Amorim's exiled 'bomb squad'.",
      "But the £18.2million deadline day signing of goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp has served to add to United's problems between the posts, rather than providing a solution to them.",
      "Having chosen to sign 23-year-old Lammens, rather than 33-year-old World Cup winner Emi Martinez from Aston Villa, United have added another keeper without having an established No.1.",
      "United take on local rivals Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium a week on Sunday in the first derby of the new season, with uncertainty over who will start in goal for Amorim's side.",
      "The United boss now has four goalkeepers in Lammens, Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton, one of whom must leave, on loan or permanently, to restore balance to a squad that has no European football this season or EFL fixtures, following the humiliating exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Sources close to Onana have revealed the Cameroon international, United's No.1 for the past two seasons, will stay and fight to reclaim that status, Bayindir is also understood to want to remain, while Heaton only signed a contract extension this summer.",
      "Throwing Lammens into the heat of a Manchester derby for his Premier League debut is a risky move, one sources close to Amorim say the United head coach is unlikely to be willing to make.",
      "If Amorim was to start Lammens at City and the young keeper makes a mistake, Amorim would be criticised for not having given him time to settle and adapt to his new environment.",
      "That leaves Onana and Bayindir, both of whom have made high-profile errors already this season, but who will know what to expect at City, in a game neither Manchester side can afford to lose, after such poor starts to the new campaign.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim is damned if he does select Lammens and that decision backfires, and damned if he doesn't, if whoever gets the nod from error-prone duo Onana and Bayindir gets the call and drops another clanger.",
      "Had United pushed ahead with a move for Martinez, even though he would have cost twice as much as Lammens, is a decade older and was demanding wages of £200,000-a-week, at least there would have been no doubt over the identity of Amorim's No.1, where now there is only more confusion.",
      "According to United sources, Lammens was not identified and ultimately signed with the expectation that he would go straight into the starting line-up. But the vulnerability of Onana and Bayindir means Amorim may decide to cut his losses and throw him straight into the team, with all the risks that brings.",
      "The major strength Lammens brings is his shot-stopping ability. No keeper across Europe's top 10 leagues has saved more penalties – five from seven faced – than the Belgium Under-21 star since the start of last season.",
      "Lammens is also arguably stronger in the air than Onana and Bayindir, and more comfortable in congested areas, when teams try to target the opposition goalkeeper, blocking him from trying to come for the ball. Lammens stopped 44 crosses last season, more than any other keeper in Belgium, underlining his confidence in coming out for the ball.",
      "There would appear to be many long-term positives from United's acquisition of 6ft 4in Lammens, but his arrival will not provide an immediate solution to the problems Amorim faces. Establishing and sticking with a recognised No.1 keeper will be the first step towards doing that.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

It displayed the club still have huge pulling power, just as they did with Bryan Mbeumo did amid interest from Tottenham this summer.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has been left concerned after learning Manchester United failed to include an obligation to buy clause in Jadon Sancho's switch to Aston Villa. The winger was one of several stars to secure a move away from Old Trafford on deadline day as Ruben Amorim successfully reduced his United squad.",
      "Sancho finalised a season-long loan switch to Villa, mirroring Marcus Rashford's path from last season. Rashford's stint under Unai Emery saw the 27-year-old earn an England recall and subsequently sealed a Barcelona loan move this summer. Sancho will be hoping to replicate his team-mate's achievements at Villa Park.",
      "Sancho was among several players wanting to leave the Red Devils this summer and attracted interest from other clubs before agreeing to his Villa switch on deadline day. It represents the third loan exit of Sancho's United career, having not appeared for the club since the 2024 Community Shield, but club legend Ferdinand was surprised to learn that Sancho could potentially return to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking about United's departures, he asked on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube Channel: \"Ain't Sancho's got an obligation to buy at the end of it? No? Oh, don't like that.\"",
      "United included a £38m obligation to buy as part of Rasmus Hojlund's move to Napoli, which also saw the club receive a £5.2m loan fee. No such obligation was agreed as part of Sancho's departure, with Villa agreeing to pay 80 per cent of his wages, plus achievable bonuses. However, Ferdinand backed the club's strategy to move on unhappy players.",
      "\"I said this ages ago, if you're going to take massive losses on these players, take them. Just to get out,\" Ferdinand argued. \"I don't think you can think about the financials too much if you're going to have them around the place and let them be a bad smell around the place. No, get rid. I don't care.",
      "\"The squad is the most important thing. Keeping the harmony and ambience in the squad is the be-all and end-all if you're going to make strides to be a more positive football club, where you aren't going to have those distractions around.",
      "\"The last thing anyone needs is Garnacho, Rashford, Sancho, Antony, etc. being around the place and having to train separately. There's always going to be an undercurrent of a negative story hanging around the place, if they stayed. So I think it's good for everybody that they've got out.\"",
      "Sancho has reached the final 12 months of his United deal, though the club possess an option to extend his contract by another year. This means United could still recover funds for Sancho depending on his displays at Villa, instead of departing as a free agent.",
      "The England winger was considered one of Europe's most promising talents when he arrived at United for £72.8m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. He struggled to meet expectations at Old Trafford, scoring 12 goals and registering six assists across 83 appearances.",
      "Sancho returned to Dortmund on loan last January and started the 2024 Champions League final, but no permanent move materialised. Last season, the 25-year-old scored five times and provided n 10 assists across 41 appearances for Chelsea as he helped the Blues secure a top-four finish and win the Europa Conference League. However, Chelsea chose to pay a £5m penalty after backing out of their £25m obligation to buy Sancho.",
      "While it remains uncertain whether Villa will become the winger's next permanent destination, he is excited about the prospect of working under Emery. \"When I spoke to the manager he gave me belief and confidence,\" Sancho told Villa's club website.",
      "\"He showed me the plan of what they want to achieve this year and it really inspired me. He definitely persuaded me, and I can't wait to work under him.\"",
      "Discussing how Rashford's stint at Villa swayed his choice, Sancho added: \"I spoke to him while he was here last season and I know he really enjoyed it. He said so many lovely things about the club, like how it's a family and you feel that friendly environment with great players and staff. I definitely felt that as I came in.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte has confessed he knows he has endured a poor start to the campaign, but insists he still sees eye-to-eye with Ruben Amorim. The Uruguay international is yet to be included in a Premier League starting XI this term.",
      "Following 85 appearances for Sporting CP during Amorim's tenure with the Portuguese giants, many expected Ugarte to become a cornerstone of the United head coach's team at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, his sole start so far this season was in the embarrassing Carabao Cup second round elimination to Grimsby Town.",
      "At Blundell Park, Ugarte did not even see the second half as he was hauled off at half time. Amorim's feelings on Ugarte's form were made even clearer when the Uruguayan was left on the bench for the entirety of United's tight 3-2 home win over Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Reflecting on his beginning to the new season, Ugarte was refreshingly candid. Speaking to El Observador, Ugarte said: \"We haven't started the season very well. My level wasn't the best either, we have to be realistic and honest.\"",
      "He then added, however: \"But I'm very confident, I have a very good relationship with the coach. I work well and I'm very excited and eager to earn a starting spot.\"",
      "Last campaign, Amorim particularly highlighted Ugarte as a player who has yet to adapt to the Premier League pace, despite his £42.3million summer 2024 switch from Paris Saint-Germain with potential add-ons of approximately £8.5m.",
      "The Portuguese boss singled out Ugarte for critique following his own goal during United's 3-1 triumph over Southampton at Old Trafford back in January. When pressed specifically about Ugarte's display, the Red Devils chief highlighted the struggles the United midfielder endured against Southampton pair Joe Aribo and Mateus Fernandes.",
      "Amorim said: \"Mateus [Fernandes] was with the number seven [Joe Aribo], creating a lot of problems for Manu (Ugarte), because Manu was running against two guys. So it's more my fault than his fault. He is going to get used to playing every three days.\"",
      "Looking at Amorim's team selections, it's apparent the Portuguese tactician doesn't feel the South American is prepared for consistent Premier League action. Amorim has deployed a central partnership of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro at the heart of his 3-4-3 system.",
      "The Red Devils chief also brought on Kobbie Mainoo as a substitute during the second period against Burnley, indicating Ugarte is presently fourth in the pecking order amongst the squad's midfield options. With United eliminated from the League Cup and absent from European competition, Ugarte's chances to feature in the engine room could prove limited.",
      "Whilst he has expressed confidence both his displays and the team's performances will develop, Amorim's earlier remarks suggest Ugarte can occasionally find himself experiencing periods of dejection. During the summer pre-season tour of the United States, Amorim spoke about the 24-year-old's challenges.",
      "The United boss said: \"The first thing is adaptation to a new team, a new country. Sometimes, you just look inside of the pitch but, off the pitch, you can have some trouble sometimes.",
      "\"He is more adapted and then he needs more confidence, it's also my job. If you look last year, take Bruno [Fernandes], who is always confident, and look at the team and the performance of the team if he doesn't perform well.",
      "\"We can see today, when they are confident in their play, it seems like everyone can touch the ball and have confidence. it is more a team thing than individual.\"",

      "Manchester United sent enquiries to sign a midfielder this summer, but they ended the transfer window without strengthening that area. Many have been left wondering whether that will be costly.",
      "United sources claim the midfield was never a priority because the club already had options that it views as strong and versatile.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are the options and Ruben Amorim must manoeuvre the first part of the season with his resources.",
      "Toby Collyer could have provided extra midfield cover, but Amorim allowed the youngster to join West Brom on a season-long loan after deciding he would not receive adequate minutes.",
      "Unless United reach the FA Cup quarter-finals this season, the 2025/26 campaign will see them play the fewest number of games in a season since 1914/15 (excluding seasons impacted by war).",
      "Although club figures say signing a new midfielder was not the priority because of their 'strong' options, it feels like a calculated decision was made based on fixtures and finances.",
      "United have just 16 Premier League games before the January window. The board has looked at Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte, Mount and Mainoo and decided there is enough there to roll the dice.",
      "There is also a belief that Sekou Kone could have a first-team impact before the end of the season. Kone did not play a single minute during the United States tour, but staff believe he could eventually contribute.",
      "It seems doubtful Kone will make any impact in the first half of the season, though. The youngster has been on the cusp of the first-team and needs more time in training to make a solid case to Amorim.",
      "Kone started for the Under-21s against Tamworth in the National League Cup last month and sustained a head injury. Kone was taken to hospital and the game had to be abandoned with no replacement ambulance available.",
      "The midfielder stayed in the hospital overnight but was discharged in the morning. Kone has been described as \"fine\" by a source and he will return to grass imminently, so he could possibly feature in behind-closed-doors U21 friendlies against the PFA and Aston Villa during the international break.",
      "United paid around £1million to sign Kone from Malian club Guidars FC. He was scouted with a view to progressing to the first-team and the deal was low risk considering the fee.",
      "Travis Binnion (Under-21 manager) also took French lessons, but Binnion credited Rowe with pushing particularly hard to learn a new language.",
      "Rowe was appointed in an academy player-coach role last year. Sources have said he is the best United have had in the hybrid academy position, which has previously been held by Paul McShane and Tom Huddlestone.",
      "Fans wanted a glimpse of Kone in pre-season in the USA. They felt he could show his talent and potentially make a case for first-team minutes, but Amorim did not use him in any of the friendlies.",
      "Kone still has a long way to go and has been on a steep learning curve since his arrival in England. He has been forced to put on muscle, get up to speed with the intensity and improve his positional understanding.",
      "Earlier this year, Binnion told the MEN: \"He’s a good player and we have high expectations for him, and any player we sign, you want to have those expectations, otherwise you go away and you aren’t signing a good player. You can see with the lads in the first-team, the level of expectation is high.",
      "\"But the reward is high and our lads have to be ready, maybe sooner than other big clubs, which is a real positive for players in the academy, but it’s hard, it’s not easy, is it?",
      "\"He has trained with the first-team quite a lot now, but as you can see tonight and the games he’s played recently, a big part of his development is the games.",
      "\"And it’s a healthier part of our first-team in that position, and the demands on that position are really high, whereas a forward player, they can maybe make more mistakes and experiment a bit more.",
      "\"The games are really important for them to get used to, the style of play, the intensity of English football and just for him to make better decisions day in, day out, in each of the games, whereas if he didn’t play games and only dropped in now and again, I think you’d see a slower rate of development.",
      "\"A lot of [academy] players train with the first-team a lot because they’re further along in their development. He does train with the first-team, but he needs to make sure he’s developing his own game, so when he goes full-time with the first-team, he’s in the right space.\"",
      "United hope Kone can improve quickly enough to contribute to the first-team this season. But Kone will not be rushed because he was signed last summer with the long-term future in mind.",

      "The 28-year-old is out of contract at the end of this season, though, and while he is expected to renew terms at the Camp Nou, an agreement hasn't yet been reached.",
      "The Uruguayan international played a key role in the Spurs side who beat United in last season's Europa League final and he already looks like he has a pivotal role in Thomas Frank's new look Spurs side.",
      "The 28-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season, though, and after joining Spurs from Juventus in January 2022, it remains to be seen whether he will be keen to explore a new challenge next summer.",
      "Goretzka may be 30 now but he is still a quality operator. The German international has won 15 trophies at Bayern Munich since joining from Schalke in 2018 and has started both league matches under Vincent Kompany this season, reiterating his importance to the side.",
      "He has spent his entire career in Germany, though, although there was speculation towards the end of last season over his future in Bavaria. His situation could be one to watch over the coming months.",
      "The twin brother of Arsenal defender Jurrien, Quinten Timber is carving out quite the reputation of his own.",
      "A Dutch international, the 24-year-old has won the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup in Rotterdam with Feyenoord when Liverpool boss Arne Slot managed the club, and he has resisted interest from elsewhere this summer to have one more season at De Kuip.",
      "He could leave for free next summer as a result and is set to have a number of potential suitors for his signature.",
      "Neves has long been linked with a move to United but when he eventually left Wolves two years ago, he made a shock move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "The Portugal international has won the league title and the Kings Cup in Saudi Arabia but he could be free to explore a return to European football next summer.",
      "The 28-year-old will be at the peak of his powers then and would be an astute pick-up for any top side.",
      "Neves' midfield partner in Saudi Arabia is Milinkovic-Savic, who United also spent years courting when he was at Lazio.",
      "The Serbia international will be 31 next summer but could still be worth a punt on a short term contract, given his impressive performances out in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Haidara has impressed at RB Leipzig for a number of years and has often been linked with a move to the Premier League. And if his contract situation in East Germany isn't resolved before next summer, he could be free to finally make that move.",
      "The 27-year-old Mali international played a key role in Leipzig winning back-to-back DFB Pokals in 2022 and 2023 and could be open to a new challenge.",

      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here,\" declared Senne Lammens after securing his move to Manchester United.",
      "The mood might not be so jovial among his fellow Old Trafford goalkeepers. Lammens completed his deadline day switch to United late on deadline day and will now bed in to his new surroundings over the international break.",
      "The arrival of the Belgian - not named in Roberto Martinez's squad for the September internationals - piles further pressure on beleaguered pair Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, who are both away on international duty this month.",
      "The pair have made costly errors already this season with the campaign only four games old. Onana was at fault for one if not both of Grimsby Town's goals in the embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat while Bayindir dropped clangers against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League having seemingly usurped Onana as Ruben Amorim's first choice.",
      "The arrival of Lammens clouds the picture further. The 23-year-old has been a regular in his homeland for Royal Antwerp and while United sources would not say if the new arrival was coming in as a potential first choice, the player himself will be ready to take a chance.",
      "\"I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years,\" he said on arrival. \"I cannot wait to get to know my teammates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.”",
      "Lammens would bring a calmness and confidence that Onana and Bayndir have failed to offer at United.",
      "\"As a goalkeeper you have to stay calm to instil confidence in your defenders and the rest of the team,\" Lammens said in a 2024 interview with Het Nieuwsblad.",
      "\"You're not supposed to be stressed out between the posts. As a youth player, that happened to me sometimes, but in recent years, it hasn't bothered me at all.",
      "\"They always say that I stay level emotionally. That I'm stable and never go up or down too quickly. I'm happy about that, by the way. I think that's a good quality for a goalkeeper.\"",
      "It's a quality United have lacked in recent years. The prospect of a calm keeper providing a foundation at the back and a confidence in his team-mates would offer the Reds a cornerstone on which to build.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson once said a great goalkeeper could be worth 15 points a season. This United are in no position to turn down a chance to improve their tally as they seek to challenge the top six following a dismal 2024-25 campaign and a stuttering start to the current season.",
      "Lammens is far from the finished article but is a decent distributor - something that United sought out when signing Onana - while the Belgian is a commanding presence in his penalty area and a capable shot stopper.",
      "According to Opta Analyst, he prevented 17.4 goals from being scored in the Belgian Pro League in 2024-25, which suggests a shot stopper capable of performing for his new club.",
      "But to do so he must be given an opportunity by Amorim. The United boss must recognise that pursuing with Onana or Bayindir just now will not provide the stability and security required.",
      "A new goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United this summer but Amorim's outlook changed amid the erratic form of Onana.",
      "Tom Heaton, 39, has not played since February 2023 and is unlikely to figure for United this season with the signing of Lammens and sparse schedule.",
      "If the Belgian is offered an opportunity, he could help unlock a new United.",

      "The Reds left it late to sign a new goalkeeper, forking out £18m to prise Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. Ruben Amorim will be hoping the 23-year-old, who kept the most clean sheets in the Belgian Pro League last season, can hit the ground running.",
      "As for outgoings, United also sanctioned a number of exits, with Rasmus Hojlund completing his move to Napoli. Elsewhere, Antony completed his permanent return to Real Betis, Jadon Sancho secured a loan to Aston Villa and Harry Amass left to join Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "All in all, it was a record-breaking summer for the Premier League. English top-flight clubs spent £3.17bn on new signings during the window, smashing the previous record of £2.46bn set in 2023.",
      "Premier League clubs also raised an eye-watering £1.82bn in player sales. By 7pm on Monday night, United boasted the third greatest net spend (£170.7m) in the division, soaring past Tottenham Hotspur (£154.2m) with the arrival of Lammens.",

      "It emerged on Tuesday morning that the EFL had fined Grimsby £20,000 for fielding an ineligible player during the match. Clarke Oduor, who was the only Grimsby player to miss his penalty, was not registered on time for the contest, with the Mariners then admitting the clerical error.",
      "MEN Sport is under the impression that no replay or expulsion from the tournament is being considered.",
      "Now, the EFL have released fixtures for the third round of the Carabao Cup - and Grimsby are involved as part of the schedule - putting to an end any hope that United could be handed a second chance.",
      "According to The Athletic, Rasmus Hojlund was left 'heartbroken' when he was shipped off to Napoli. The 22-year-old striker had failed to impress since joining United from Atalanta for £72m a couple of years ago.",
      "This summer, he joined Antonio Conte's side on loan. The deal reportedly includes a £34m obligation to buy clause that will be activated if the Italian champions qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Manchester United sent enquiries to sign a midfielder this summer, but they ended the transfer window without strengthening that area. Many have been left wondering whether that will be costly.",
      "United sources claim the midfield was never a priority because the club already had options that it views as strong and versatile.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are the options and Ruben Amorim must manoeuvre the first part of the season with his resources.",
      "Toby Collyer could have provided extra midfield cover, but Amorim allowed the youngster to join West Brom on a season-long loan after deciding he would not receive adequate minutes.",
      "Unless United reach the FA Cup quarter-finals this season, the 2025/26 campaign will see them play the fewest number of games in a season since 1914/15 (excluding seasons impacted by war).",

      "Manchester United summer signing Benjamin Sesko has said it's a wish come true to sign at Old Trafford and believes he's getting better with each passing training session.",

      "“But I am very much looking forward to the coming period, also because I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day.",
      "\"I wanted to move to England and fortunately my wish came true.\"",
      "Also discussing the upcoming Manchester derby, Sesko said: \"It’s true, it’s an incredibly big match coming up. There will simply be some pressure on both sides to just win this match. There’s still quite a bit to go until this match, but we’re definitely looking forward to a top-notch match.”",
      "According to the Dutch newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws in Belgium, as quoted by Sport Witness, Royal Antwerp were upset to discover that Senne Lammens had boarded a private jet to the United Kingdom before they had agreed terms with United.",
      "The report claims that the 23-year-old goalkeeper, who joined the Reds on deadline day, was 'theoretically not allowed to travel, but he did so anyway'. It's said that there was 'some resentment' within the club, having travelled without their approval.",
      "Antwerp finally reached an agreement with United when Lammens was airborne...",
      "Paul Scholes has named Gianluigi Donnarumma as the signing of the summer, overlooking the wealth of talent that United brought to Old Trafford. Following the Italy international's move to Manchester City, the former Reds midfielder took to Instagram.",
      "\"Donnarumma for £26m surely has to be signing of the window,\" said Scholes. \"Obviously apart from the 14 Salford City have signed [praying emoji].\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand was pleased with United's business this summer. The Reds forked out £230m on Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Ruben Amorim also managed to finally offload his 'bomb squad', with Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford all finding new clubs.",
      "On his show, the United legend said: \"I'm going to give it a 7.5, maybe an eight. I think I'll give it an eight based on the players they've got out of the football club because they had the potential to affect the ambience if they were hanging around.",
      "\"I think it's been a good decision from the club, good active work from the people behind the scenes.\"",
      "Speaking on his latest YouTube video, Fabrizio Romano provided an update on United's unsuccessful approach for Conor Gallagher on deadline day. The journalist said: \"In the last 48 hours of the summer transfer window, Man United tried to sign Conor Gallagher.",
      "\"Man United considered the possibility to go for Conor Gallagher. It was not possible to make it happen, because Manchester United wanted to sign Gallagher on a loan deal, while Atletico Madrid already rejected a loan approach from Crystal Palace ten days ago.",
      "\"The top targets on loan for Palace were Conor Gallagher and Yeremy Pino. Pino arrived, Gallagher they tried to bring back to the club, he knows the club very well.",
      "\"But the answer from Atletico to Manchester United was no, no chance to that surprise proposal in the final hours of the summer transfer window. They tried for a midfielder, but no for the deal...\"",
      "Speaking to Spanish outlet Cope, Antony claimed he rejected an eye-watering offer from Bayern Munich to return Real Betis. The former United winger said: \"I spoke with Bayern, I don’t know if it was €7m (£6m), but I said I had Betis’ word and that it was 95% certain and that I would respect my word.",
      "\"I feel comfortable making this decision because I’m very happy here. More than five teams called me. Today will mark my life; it was very emotional, and I’ve never experienced that before.",
      "\"My family is very happy; it’s very hard to be away from them, and it’s been very hard being alone in the hotel for more than 40 days. My wife was waiting in Seville, and I told her my first choice was Betis.",
      "\"I was very moved seeing the affection of the Betis fans; I couldn’t get out of the car, so I ran out. It was a very nice party...\"",
      "According to TeamTalk, United and Chelsea are frontrunners in the race to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window. The report claims the two Premier League clubs have shortlisted the 21-year-old midfielder as a 'key target'.",
      "It's said that United and Chelsea view Wharton as a 'potential game-changer'. The former Blackburn Rovers playmaker sees his contract at Selhurst Park expire in June 2029.",
      "According to The Athletic, United recently considered signing Danny Welbeck from Brighton. The report claims that Erik ten Hag wanted to bring the 34-year-old striker to Old Trafford last year, but the Reds couldn't explore a deal due to hierarchy restructure.",
      "It's said that United tried again in the summer, and they were prepared to offer him a two-year contract. Welbeck has just entered the final 12 months of his deal at the Amex Stadium, making him available on a free in June 2026.",
      "Angelo Stiller has provided an update on his future at Stuttgart. Speaking to German outlet Bild, as quoted by SPORT, the 24-year-old midfielder said: \"I'm not currently thinking about moving.",
      "\"I've discussed it with my management that this is out of the question for me right now. I'm a regular and leading player here. The most important thing for my development is that I get my minutes – especially in a World Cup year. I definitely didn't want to jeopardise the World Cup.\"",
      "Stiller was linked with a move to United during the summer transfer window. The Germany international added: \"Basically, I'm attracted to moving abroad at some point.",
      "\"I thought Florian Wirtz's decision to go to Liverpool was cool. One thing is clear to me: At the end of my career, I absolutely want to play in the USA, in the MLS. This plan, this goal, is 100 percent.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim will be putting those still at Carrington through their paces over the next week or so as the Reds look to transform their fortunes. United were fortunate to end August with a win after a shaky start to the season.",
      "When Antony was unveiled to the media following his £21m move to Real Betis, the Brazilian was overcome by emotion.",
      "Describing his time at Old Trafford, Antony said: \"What happened in Manchester, only I know how difficult it was. I’m sorry. Training separately, but that’s part of life. I knew this moment would come. It’s in the past.\"",
      "The 25-year-old looked revitalised during his loan spell in Spain last season. He scored nine goals and bagged five assists in his 25 games for Betis.",
      "Jadon Sancho has explained why he joined Aston Villa this summer on a season-long loan.",
      "He told Villa TV: \"First of all, when I spoke to the manager, he gave me belief and confidence. He showed me the plan for this year, and it really inspired me. He definitely persuaded me, and I can’t wait to work under him.\"",
      "It has also been made clear that Marcus Rashford was an influence on Sancho's decision making.",
      "The Independent's Miguel Delaney has claimed that Romeo Lavia is emerging as a possible target just two years after his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Injuries have plagued Lavia's progress and have forced him to miss 73 games. According to Transfermarkt, hamstring injuries have been his biggest issue, keeping him out for 291 days. In total, Lavia has missed a whopping 490 days since moving to Chelsea.",
      "Unfortunately, muscle problems can become a constant issue for players. Right now, Lavia's injury record is enough reason for United to stay as far away from the midfielder as possible...",
      "Ruben Amorim's side looked to have switched their focus from Martinez to Senne Lammens late on. The Belgian goalkeeper was signed yesterday for £18m.",
      "Martinez was absent from Villa's clash with Crystal Palace on Sunday amid uncertainty over his future. Now, the World Cup winner must reintegrate himself into the Villa squad.",
      "Grimsby have been fined £20k after they fielded an ineligible player in their Carabao Cup victory over Manchester United.",
      "The Mariners' defender Clarke Odur was registered 59 seconds too late. The 26-year-old came on with 19 minutes to play and went on to miss his penalty during the shooutout.",
      "TalkSPORT host Andy Goldstein made his opinion clear when he said: \"Get rid of them. The competition is better with Man United, get rid of the little club. They shouldn't have broken the rules. It's not my fault.",
      "\"I want any club that breaks rules to be out. Get them out. Keep your fish and chips and get them out of the competition.\"",
      "Roy Keane has given his opinion on Manchester United's new £200m frontline following Ruben Amorim's opening few games.",
      "\"I think he'll [Mbeumo] be a hit. I like him. Too early to tell [about Sesko].\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has highlighted a key issue in Jadon Sancho's loan move to Aston Villa this season.",
      "He told Rio Ferdinand Presents: \"Ain't Sancho's got an obligation to buy at the end of it? No? Oh, don't like that.",
      "\"I said this ages ago, if you're going to take massive losses on these players, take them. Just to get out. I don't think you can think about the financials too much if you're going to have them around the place and let them be a bad smell around the place. No, get rid. I don't care.\"",
      "Paul Scholes has questioned Ruben Amorim's transfer strategy this summer after Manchester United signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for £133.5m combined.",
      "He told The Overlap, as per ManUtdNews: \"Bringing two numbers tens (Cunha and Mbeumo) was that really necessary? You think you’ve got Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo can do that… If you’ve done that and wasted a bit of money and not been able to get a midfield player or a goalkeeper, it’s not great recruitment-wise, is it?",
      "“I can’t make better what a lot of the problems are in the team, which are two central midfield players, and the goalkeepers are massive.”",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir has been linked with a move to Turkish side Trabzonspor.",
      "This is according to Attacking Football who claim that, after Trabzonspor sold captain Ugurcan Cakir to rivals Galatasaray for £27m, Bayindir could make the move to Trabzon.",
      "A move for Bayindir could be possible due to Turkey's summer transfer window not closing until September 12th. It would be a home move for the Turkish international.",
      "16-year-old Kevin Filling is not entertaining rumours linking him with a move to Manchester United or Tottenham.",
      "The AIK youngster said, via Fotboll Skanalen: \"I try not to think about it in any special way. I just look at where I am now. I’m at AIK and I continue here every training session. I’m going to get better as a person and as a player. That’s where I am (in my mind).",
      "\"For me, it feels pretty simple. Because that’s who I am as a person. That’s for others to handle.\"",
      "Filling scored in his debut game for AIK earlier this year in a 3-0 win over IFK Goteborg.",
      "FootballTransfers report that Manchester United 'agreed personal terms' with Danny Welbeck on deadline day, but the move collapsed after Brighton failed to secure a replacement.",
      "The outlet adds that a deal could still be revived in January when the transfer window reopens.",
      "Welbeck’s contract with Brighton expires next summer, meaning the Seagulls would need to sell before then if they want to receive a fee.",
      "Fermin Lopez had no intentions on moving to the Premier League despite interest from Manchester United and Chelsea.",
      "Lopez's Barcelona teammate Lamine Yamal told Spanish outlet RTVE: \"He's fine and happy as always. At Barca, if someone leaves, it's their decision. We're a young, united group where there are no problems between us, and we enjoy the club we're at.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to leave. We jokingly asked him what was going on with England, but he told us he wanted to stay, that he was happy.”",
      "According to The Athletic, Manchester United warned Liam Delap that he would face competition at Chelsea with the Blues eyeing Joao Pedro.",
      "Less than a month after Chelsea confirmed the signing of Delap, Pedro's £60m move was announced. It was the Brazilian striker who started over the Englishman in Chelsea's opening Premier League game this season.",

      "The EFL have confirmed that Grimsby Town will travel to Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday, September 16, ending Manchester United's mooted hopes of getting a potential reprieve.",
      "United crashed out of the competition after losing on penalties to the League Two side last Wednesday evening, following a dramatic 2-2 draw after 90 minutes. Grimsby went 2-0 up at Blundell Park, before Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire struck for the Reds to take the tie to a penalty shootout.",
      "The Mariners ended up holding their nerve to beat United 12-11 from 12 yards - with Mbeumo missing the decisive 26th spot-kick to send the plucky fourth-tier side through to the next round.",
      "However, it emerged on Tuesday morning that the EFL had fined Grimsby £20,000 for fielding an ineligible player during the match. Clarke Oduor, who was the only Grimsby player to miss his penalty, was not registered on time for the contest, with the Mariners then admitting the clerical error.",
      "They must now pay £10,000, with the remaining £10,000 suspended until the end of the season, with MEN Sport also under the impression that no replay or expulsion from the tournament is being considered.",

      "The registration of Oduor was submitted to the EFL at one minute past the deadline and the issue was not immediately identified by the club due to a computer problem being experienced at Grimsby.",

      "Grimsby Town have been fined for fielding an ineligible player against Manchester United.",
      "United dramatically crashed out of the Carabao Cup on penalties at Blundell Park last week. Grimsby progressed to the next round after prevailing in the penalty shootout, following a 2-2 draw.",
      "However, it has transpired that a Grimsby player, Clarke Oduor, was ineligible to play in the game.",
      "Oduor was introduced to the contest to replace George McEachran in the 73rd minute. Oduor signed for Grimsby from Bradford City on a season-long deal a day before the game and the League Two club submitted his registration a minute late, which meant he was ineligible to feature against United.",
      "Grimsby reported themselves for the late registration and the EFL board launched an investigation.",
      "The EFL have fined Grimsby and released a statement to confirm their breach of the rules.",
      "The statement said: \"The EFL Board, acting as the management committee of the Carabao Cup, has today fined Grimsby Town Football Club £20,000 - of which £10,000 will be suspended until the end of Season 2025/26 - for having breached the rules of the competition.",
      "\"The breach relates to the club fielding an ineligible player against Manchester United in a round two tie on 27 August 2025. Grimsby Town progressed to round three following a 12-11 penalty shoot-out win at Blundell Park.",
      "\"The circumstances leading to this transgression are that Grimsby Town submitted the registration of Clarke Oduor at 12:01pm on the day before the fixture i.e. shortly after the 12:00pm deadline required in accordance with the 2025/26 competition rules.",
      "\"The club self-reported the breach upon discovery the day after the fixture had been completed.",
      "\"Following a comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup, the board determined that the issuing of a fine followed precedent.",
      "\"The board further noted the club's non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead. The club has sinceimplemented several actions to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.",
      "\"The club will be liable for the suspended sum of £10,000, if they were to again field an ineligible player in any league competition between now and the end of Season 2025/26.\"",
      "United trailed Grimsby 2-0 at half-time at Blundell Park but forced a penalty shootout after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire.",
      "When asked what went wrong, Amorim said: \"Everything. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened, it's a problem in our club, we should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans.",
      "\"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want. I think it's easy for you [how to interpret it]. Let's focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.",
      "\"Doesn't matter [that we lost on penalties]. In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.",
      "\"I'm the manager. It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I'm really sorry for our fans. Let's focus on the next game. That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today.",
      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",
      "\"You cannot change so much. You cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance. I think this is a little bit the limit.",
      "\"I think something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.\"",

      "Alastair Campbell was in the Old Trafford directors' box on Saturday, so the Manchester United communications department had an expert to turn to for some spin on their transfer window.",
      "Four senior signings and four senior departures is a modest turnover for the worst United squad in 51 years, a reflection of the Ineos cabal's backing for head coach Ruben Amorim and the business they have hitherto overseen.",
      "United invested £225.32million to bring in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. The word from well-placed sources is United did what they set out to achieve.",
      "Almost every player who was realistically expected to leave has left. Jettisoning Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho protected the long-term harmony of the squad and its performance culture.",
      "United cut the cord with Antony and Rasmus Hojlund, two headline signings of the Erik ten Hag era, in further shows of support for Amorim.",
      "Tyrell Malacia has proven to be unsellable, never mind a tough sell. Like one of their custodians, United were caught short on the goalkeeper front. They now have more goalies than out-and-out central midfielders.",
      "United are comfortable with their midfield roster. The quintet of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount have been billed as \"versatile\" by sources. Only three are specialists.",
      "With the deadline three days away, director of recruitment Christopher Vivell was on the phone at the club's Carrington training complex and could be heard acknowledging that a planned move was viewed as a \"step down\" by an unnamed player. Jadon Sancho held out long enough to secure an unforeseeable move to a Premier League club.",
      "United intended to come out of the blocks, as a senior source put it, with two early deals in the window: Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap. Delap's decision to join Chelsea over United for £30million meant the club ended up paying more than double that for their new No.9, Benjamin Sesko. He is yet to start a Premier League game.",
      "Sesko was a fourth-choice target - at best - and his performances have been as unconvincing as Amorim's handling of the 22-year-old. Wilcox was quoted in the statement confirming Sesko's signing but Vivell is more closely attached to the Slovenian. The pair were photographed in a celebratory clinch when Sesko signed for RB Leipzig in 2022.",
      "United conducted a data-led review of their 2024-25 season to determine which area required the most attention and concluded that a lack of goals was the biggest contributing factor to their worst season since relegation in 1974. Basic maths could have concluded that, never mind a bespoke algorithm.",
      "Members of the bomb squad sought shelter in temporary accommodation. Antony relocated to the Marriott hotel in Hale Barns, so close to Manchester Airport that the take-offs may have interrupted his sleep. Sancho was in and out of his mansion in the same suburb. Garnacho switched to a flat in Hale but was still paying the rent on his mansion that his parents and brother moved out of last season.",
      "United did their utmost to put a positive spin on the £40m sale of Garnacho. He had angled to leave in public and the fee is the fourth-highest for a departure in the club's history. Even former academy staff toasted the money United had recouped for him.",
      "Yet United banked only £2.5m more than Ipswich Town did from Nottingham Forest for Omari Hutchinson. Garnacho is a United academy graduate, Premier League-proven winger and Argentina international. Chelsea have got him on the cheap.",
      "United sources claimed Chelsea's opening offer was £25m. Both sides have dabbled in mischief-making against each other over the summer, whether it be Chelsea linking United with their dead wood strikers or United adding Chelsea to the clubs that Bryan Mbeumo rejected. Chelsea denied that they moved for Mbeumo.",
      "Garnacho and his on-off partner, Eva Garcia, visited London almost weekly last season. Sources say they would not be surprised if Ms Garcia returns to England now that the father of her child has moved to the capital. United staff on the post-season tour knew there was no chance of a U-turn from Amorim on Garnacho amid the winger's surly behaviour in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.",
      "Agency sources said early in the summer that Amorim's 'bomb squad' strategy would cost United millions. Chelsea and Real Betis were the only bidders at the table for Garnacho and Antony, which drove their prices down.",
      "Antony is a huge loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. United insiders say the club have nevertheless - maintained financial discipline in compliance with PSR.",
      "It remains to be seen if director of football Jason Wilcox will now emerge from the shadows. Dan Ashworth reflected on United's summer transfer window two days after it closed last year in the Old Trafford boardroom with journalists.",
      "One fan who encountered Wilcox enthusiastically lobbied him to get the Sesko deal done. Wilcox cagily stressed that Newcastle were also interested. The fan reminded him, \"It's Newcastle.\"",
      "Senior figures at United repeatedly stressed a goalkeeper was not a priority but Amorim's assessment of that area evolved as Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir took turns to drop clangers. Amorim endorsed an enquiry for Emiliano Martinez but Lammens is more aligned with the data-driven model United are implementing.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was the first of that ilk. He has been overpromoted and overplayed to the point that Amorim resorted to starting Diogo Dalot on the left wing against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "United noted that Lammens had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe, made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe’s top ten leagues and made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23. That will all be irrelevant when he is in net for the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "United supporters of a certain vintage will recall that Royal Antwerp were the club's original feeder club in the Nineties. United farmed out 34 players to the Belgian side and never signed anyone from them. Lammens is the first.",
      "Sources say a goalkeeper was a secondary priority contingent on whether Lammens would become available. Funds had to be raised from sales and loans for United to have the headroom to execute the £18.2m deal.",
      "Lammens and Sesko are contradictions. Amorim all but admitted that United prioritised established Premier League recruits yet the two most important positions in the team - in goal and up front - have been taken up by Premier League novices.",
      "\"You watch every weekend Matheus doing things against the players that you are going to face,\" Amorim said in Chicago on July 25. \"That can help you to have more certainty when you choose players. So that was a policy that we tried to use this season.",
      "\"So I can say yes, it's not just that, because they have characteristics that we need, but we focus on getting players that can come here and to face this kind of pressure, like you said, since the first day.\" Club sources clarified there was a balance of recruits to immediately improve the team and younger players with potential.",
      "United will leave it to Amorim to clarify whether Lammens, not among the four goalkeepers in the Belgium squad this month, is their new No.1. Elsewhere in goal, there is no movement on any outgoings (at the time of writing). United have four senior 'keepers in a season where they could play as few as 40 games if they exit the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "The Turkish transfer window is open until September 12 but Jose Mourinho had no interest in Onana or Bayindir before his defenestration at Fenerbahce. The Süper Lig runners-up bought Mourinho's old scourge, Ederson, who tossed milk at the Portuguese after Manchester City won at Old Trafford in December 2017.",
      "A dressing room source said Amorim was wary that Bayindir's confidence could be \"killed\" if he was dropped after his costly 'keeping against Arsenal. By sticking by the Turk at Fulham, Onana's own self-esteem plummeted, though that does not excuse his chastening performance at Grimsby Town.",
      "Confidence in both goalkeepers has dwindled among the United players. \"Altay is a good 'keeper and has good skills,\" a source who works with the player said. \"But United is too demanding for him.\"",
      "United will go big for a midfielder next year as the area was not regarded as a priority in the recent window. They came up short with Carlos Baleba but have started the long game. Casemiro will not be at the club next season and his heir apparent, Manuel Ugarte, has been the poorest of the Ineos-era recruits.",
      "Ugarte played under Amorim for two years at Sporting Lisbon but has started this season where he ended last season: on the bench. The interest in Baleba would suggest some at United have already given up on him.",
      "No amount of spin can disguise that.",

      "Manchester United will meet Carlos Baleba later this month just weeks after the Reds enquired about the Brighton & Hove Albion star's services.",
      "During the summer transfer window, United registered an interest in signing the defensive midfielder shortly after completing the signing of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Brighton swiftly informed Ruben Amorim's men that Baleba wasn't for sale and it wasn't long before United informed their Premier League rivals they would not pursue a move. Their interest is, however, expected to be reignited in the future.",
      "The Athletic reported after the transfer window closed that United had agreed personal terms with Baleba over a move to Old Trafford. However, Brighton's £115m, at the minimum, valuation is said to have put them off.",
      "United eventually decided against signing a new midfielder before Monday's deadline, instead bringing goalkeeper Senne Lammens in. Amid speculation over his future, Baleba has remained extremely professional and started all three of Brighton's league games.",
      "The midfielder is currently away with Cameroon for their World Cup qualifying double-header against Eswatini and Cape Verde. Upon his arrival in England, the 21-year-old will return to the Brighton squad for a busy September.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's side take on Bournemouth, Tottenham, Chelsea and Wolves in the league and Barnsley in the Carabao Cup before the next international break. After the October pause in domestic football, United welcome Baleba to Old Trafford on October 25.",
      "The game will see Amorim watch Baleba in action for the first time this season and comes after a tough trip to rivals Liverpool the week previous.",
      "Baleba will have another chance to show United and Amorim what he can do on the final day of the season in May when the reverse fixture takes place.",

      "He continued: “As a player and especially as a team, we have to be achieving big things. We have to be looking towards that, and hopefully I can help the team to achieve some of those goals.",
      "“The team comes first, so whenever the manager needs me I’ll be ready. I’ve got individual goals, but my main goal is for the team. Achieving something as a team is much more special than individually.",

      "His fine form since moving to the MHP Arena from TSG Hoffenheim has made him one of the most sought-after talents in European football, with United and Real Madrid linked with the 24-year-old this summer. Los Blancos head coach Xabi Alonso is claimed to view Stiller as the ideal defensive midfielder for his project at the Santiago Bernabeu, but Madrid would also not make a move this summer.",

      "Manchester United did not consider strengthening their midfield as a priority this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon were signed in the summer window, but United did not strengthen Ruben Amorim's midfield options.",
      "United sources have said the midfield was never a priority due to already having options that the club views as strong and versatile.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are the options in midfield for Amorim. Casemiro and Fernandes have started in all three Premier League games this season.",
      "United enquired about Carlos Baleba's availability and Brighton valued the midfielder at around £100million. However, United spent £215m on signings, making it difficult to finance a marquee midfield arrival.",
      "Toby Collyer was allowed to join West Brom on a season-long loan. Collyer was permanently promoted to the first-team last term, but was given the green light to leave for first team football.",
      "Mainoo asked to leave on loan in the final week of the summer window. United blocked his request and Amorim insisted in his pre-Burnley press conference that he wanted the youngster to say.",
      "Speaking after the Fulham draw, Amorim revealed Mainoo was battling Fernandes for a starting role.",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he’s going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he’s fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Mainoo started against Grismby in the Carabao Cup defeat and came on at half-time against Burnley due to a Mount injury.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sancho, 25, is out of contract at United in the summer with the club not planning to extend his current terms.",
      "The ex-Dortmund star has already returned to Germany and spent time with Chelsea since his high-profile move to United back in 2021.",
      "Taking to Instagram to celebrate his newest venture, Sancho collaborated with Aston Villa's page and the Premier League to announce his move to Villa Park.",
      "But not one current United player could be seen in the comments of the post, nor was any visible to have used the like feature either.",
      "Sancho is known to be close to former Villa loanee Marcus Rashford and is said to have spoken to the Three Lions star about his time in the Midlands.",
      "Emery will look to get a tune out of Sancho much as Enzo Maresca did last term at Stamford Bridge, with the winger registering 14 goal contributions from 42 games.",
      "He also scored in the 4-1 win over Real Betis to help the Blues win the UEFA Conference League.",
      "Speaking to Villa's club media on Monday, Sancho was excited for his new challenge and believes more success is only right around the corner, with Europa League football to come this term.",

      "Antony broke down in tears in his first interview as a permanent Real Betis player on Tuesday afternoon, as he reflected on his \"difficult\" spell at Manchester United.",
      "The 25-year-old, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Betis, made it clear to United that he wanted to return to the Seville-based club in the summer transfer window.",
      "But, after a number of weeks waiting to resolve his future and training alone, Antony finally got his wish as Betis and United came to an agreement, with his move confirmed on deadline day.",
      "Despite paying £86million for his service from Ajax just three years ago, United are set to receive a fixed fee of £19m plus £2.6m in add-ons for the Brazil international. The Reds have inserted a 50 per cent sell-on clause into the deal to profit if Antony moves on from Betis in the future.",
      "During his time in Manchester, Antony scored 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances. He showed glimpses of brilliance in his debut season at United, helping the Reds to the Carabao Cup and a third-place finish in the Premier League. But, from that point on, it went downhill for him.",
      "Antony ended up moving to Betis on loan in January and he enjoyed a successful spell, scoring nine times and adding five assists in 26 matches at the back end of last season.",
      "He was one of five United players, including Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, that informed the club of his desire to explore different opportunities earlier this summer and he ended up training individually.",
      "That, alongside his previous difficulties, contributed to Antony having an emotional moment when he opened up on his time at United during his presentation as a permanent Betis player.",
      "Antony said: \"Only my family knows how difficult it was to be there (in tears).",
      "\"Training separately... but I knew this incredible moment was coming. Of course, I was afraid it wouldn't happen in the end, but I waited because I had so much faith.\"",
      "He added: \"What a difference! Seville is more beautiful than Manchester. I'm finally here. I spent more than 40 days in a hotel; it was very hard, but everyone knew I wanted to return to Betis.",
      "\"Now with more time, we have so many things to do and achieve. I had trouble sleeping after seeing so much affection from the Betis fans; there were people waiting at my house at 2am.\"",
      "As the transfer window neared its conclusion, Antony was concerned that his dream move to Betis might not go through. But, with less than 15 minutes until it slammed shut, United confirmed his departure.",
      "\"Every day I was very anxious, on Sunday everything was ready to travel, but we had to wait,\" Antony continued.",
      "\"I made it very clear that my first choice was Betis, it was Betis or Betis, there was no other option. I spoke to my mother and my sister in Brazil, they were crying, because what happened in Manchester was very difficult...",
      "\"Being separated, but that's part of life, I knew this incredible moment was going to come. These things are already in the past and now we are here, which for me is a dream.\"",

      "During his time in Manchester, following his initial £62m move from Atalanta in August 2023, Hojlund, 22, scored 26 times and provided six assists in 96 appearances across all competitions.",
      "However, after Benjamin Sesko joined United from RB Leipzig last month, it was clear that Hojlund was not part of Ruben Amorim's long-term plans at Old Trafford and he could therefore leave.",

Look at the first half, we have so many chances to score.",

      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Ruben Amorim during his speech on the final day of last season.",
      "Manchester United finished 15th in the Premier League and needed to respond in the summer window. Many thought defeat in the Europa League final would damage the club's prospects in the market.",
      "Thankfully, the window did not unfold like that. Liverpool were the Premier League club to 'win' the summer with their impressive business, but United must be considered among the sides who have conducted fine deals after a productive three months in a difficult market to manoeuvre.",
      "United overhauled their attacking line after scoring a dismal 44 league goals last season, adding Premier League-proven players and a striker, and completed the signing of a goalkeeper.",
      "The only blemish was the failure to sign a new midfielder, which could be a major problem area.",
      "But it's worth focusing on the positives to begin with. Matheus Cunha was the first signing of the summer for £62.5milliion from Wolves, which was a straightforward deal to complete.",
      "United triggered Cunha's release clause at Molineux and personal terms were not a problem. It was the perfect start, but fans began to raise concerns during the pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Brentford are notoriously tricky to negotiate with and hung tough in discussions for Mbeumo. United entered talks by bidding £45m, with £10m in add-ons, and they finally walked away from the table with an agreement to sign Mbeumo for £65m, plus £6m in add-ons, over a month later.",
      "United are not the only club to be stung by the Bees' tough negotiating this summer, as Newcastle signed Yoane Wissa in a £55m deal on the final day of the window after a dogged pursuit of the forward.",
      "Mbeumo was signed in time to travel to the United States for the pre-season tour. He got off the mark against Grimsby and scored his first Premier League goal against Burnley.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo should be terrific additions. They have already demonstrated their quality in their short time at the club, and supporters are desperately hoping for a positive injury update on Cunha after the Brazilian was forced to be substituted with a muscle injury in the first half against Burnley.",
      "In comparison, Benjamin Sesko has looked rusty, although he does possess the potential to become one of the finest strikers in Europe. Ideally, United would have signed a frontman with experience, but they had to play the cards they were dealt and Sesko was attainable.",
      "United moved with impressive speed to wrap up a deal for Sesko, beating Newcastle to his signature. The Magpies are in the Champions League this season, but Sesko always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "The only slight negative with Sesko is that United needed a striker who could hit the ground running, someone who would make an immediate impact and score goals in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim has not started Sesko in the league since his arrival, preferring Mason Mount down the middle instead.",
      "Speaking after the win over Burnley, Amorim explained his decision not to bring the Slovenia international on earlier against Scott Parker's side.",
      "\"So he finished the [Grimsby] game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties,\" explained Amorim.",
      "\"And today was that reason also, because (Joshua) Zirkzee is also a striker, he's an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a division four team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.",
      "\"With the problem with Mason Mount (injury), I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes. So everything was connected. The penalty, the game on Wednesday, and the number of minutes that I was thinking to put Ben today.\"",
      "In the same press conference, Amorim defended his goalkeeper options, but it was crucial that United pushed in the final days of the transfer to strengthen that department.",
      "Altay Bayindir has made mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League this season. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby Town and made an error for their second goal.",
      "United sources consider Senne Lammens to be an exciting young goalkeeper with a bright future. The 23-year-old was called up to Belgium's senior squad in March and has a huge opportunity at United.",
      "It is hoped the £18.2m fee to sign Lammens from Royal Antwerp could prove to be a bargain in a few years. Diego Leon and Enzo Kana Biyik were also exciting young additions for the club's future.",
      "United explored signing a midfielder in the window. Brighton valued Carlos Baleba in excess of £100million and planned to keep him for another season, which killed the hope of adding him to the squad.",
      "The 21-year-old has developed a strong reputation in a short space of time at Brighton, but would Baleba have been an instant success? He is a young midfielder and Brighton's valuation was daunting.",
      "Nonetheless, it is disappointing that United ended the window without strengthening in the centre of the pitch. Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are poor options and Amorim felt he needed a fresh face.",
      "United will have to make do for the first six months of the season. Midfield could be a problem and United would have overseen a perfect transfer window if they had signed a top player in the ilk of Casemiro.",
      "Ineos chiefs will have to settle for 'an almost perfect' window instead. The members of the 'bomb squad' proved hard to shift, but United eventually got there in the end, with the exception of Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan and there is an option to make the move permanent for £26m. Barcelona are covering Rashford's wages, which is estimated to save United around £12m this season.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was sold to Chelsea for £40m. That felt like a low fee for a player whose value was much higher 12 months ago, but the wider context must be considered",
      "United received £19m, with a potential £2.6m in add-ons, for Antony, while Rasmus Hojlund joined Napoli on loan with a view to it becoming permanent for £38m next summer when certain obligations are met.",
      "Aston Villa will also cover at least 80 per cent of Jadon Sancho's wages during his loan.",
      "United will be pleased with the business they have conducted.",

      "Manchester United have upheld a near century-old tradition after Ruben Amorim blocked Kobbie Mainoo's late push to leave the club.",
      "Worried about limited first-team minutes - and with the 2026 World Cup presumably on his mind - Mainoo had asked to leave on loan in search of game-time. He was also linked with a £50million permanent move to Napoli, though the Serie A side never followed up with a formal bid.",
      "As a result, Mainoo remains in United's first-team squad, a role of particular significance given he is the only academy graduate currently in the group. For 88 consecutive years, the Red Devils have ensured that at least one homegrown player features in their senior setup.",
      "During Sir Alex Ferguson's reign, academy products regularly formed a sizeable part of the squad. But in the decade or so since his departure, those numbers have steadily declined.",
      "This summer alone, United lost three more graduates: Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan, Alejandro Garnacho completed a move to Chelsea, and Jonny Evans hung up his boots. Had Mainoo left as well, the club's longstanding tradition of promoting from within would have come to an end.",
      "In truth, United may have simply kicked the can down the road. Mainoo's long-term future remains uncertain. His contract runs until 2027, but negotiations over fresh terms have stalled for months - sewing seeds of doubt and unrest in both camps.",
      "Should talks continue to stall and Mainoo's playing time remain limited, United could be forced to consider selling, particularly before he enters the final year of his deal, when player valuations typically drop.",
      "That said, Amorim has publicly stressed that Mainoo remains central to his plans, despite his cautious use of the youngster so far. \"I want Kobbie to stay,\" he said ahead of United's 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday.",
      "\"He needs to fight for his place. And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "Mainoo first broke into United's senior squad during the 2022/23 season and has since made 74 appearances, scoring seven goals. This term, however, he has featured only once in the Premier League.",
      "Under Amorim, he has played in around two-thirds of the Portuguese's 46 matches in charge at Old Trafford, but has been named in the starting XI just 16 times. Injuries have played their part, but Amorim's preference for a two-man midfield has made competition fierce, with Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte all seemingly ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Now, Mainoo faces a battle not only to secure his place in Amorim's side, but also his future at the club - with United's proud tradition and history, in part, hanging in the balance.",

      "However, Lammens ‘did not convince other top-flight clubs when they assessed him’ with the Daily Mail adding that a report in Belgium said that Sunderland and Leeds ‘enquired – but quickly dropped out when they heard the hefty asking price’.",
      "It is not yet clear whether Lammens was signed from Royal Antwerp to be the No.1 or not but the Daily Mail continues: ‘The Premier League poses a range of tests for goalkeepers – athletic, mental, physical, technical – that exceed those of most other leagues and though scouts could see Lammens’ potential, they felt it would be a risk to pitch him straight into a first-choice role in England.’",
      "After signing for Man Utd on deadline day, Lammens said: “I am extremely proud to be joining Manchester United; it is a real dream come true. The past few years have been an amazing journey; it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special.",
      "“You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years. I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff.",
      "“This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.”",
      "Man Utd appear to have three second-choice keepers and no first-choice, while Liverpool and Spurs have gambled on their first-choice defence staying fit.",
      "Aston Villa are reportedly ‘bitter’ after Man Utd signed Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, despite offering more money for the 23-year-old.",
      "Manchester United reportedly decided to sign Senne Lammens over Emiliano Martinez for two key reasons, while one star ‘will go’ in the coming days.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s preference to leave on loan stopped Man Utd from signing a £25m Premier League star on transfer deadline day, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd and Man City are both set to sign goalkeepers ill-suited to who and where they are. Any chance of a deal sheet Lammens, Donnarumma swap?",
      "Man Utd have reached a ‘total agreement’ to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeper Senne Lammens ahead of the deadline, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein."

      "Alexander Isak just makes the top 10 highest earners in the Premier League after signing a Liverpool contract that sees the new record signing trouser the same amount as Arsenal’s best-paid star…",
      "Isak completed an acrimonious move to Anfield on Deadline Day, copping a hefty pay-rise in the process.",
      "Still, there are nine players, including two new team-mates, paid more than  British football’s most expensive star.",
      "This ranking is based on weekly wages only – no bonuses included – with most figures sourced from Capology.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak (Liverpool) – £280,000 a week\nIsak will be paid £14.56m a year, the same as Arsenal’s highest earner, Kai Havertz. That’s an increase of 133 per cent on the £120,000-a-week salary he was trousering at Newcastle. Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player.",
      "",
      "9) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish has joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest.",
      "",
      "7) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably wept weekly when similar amounts left their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Casemiro’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "",
      "6) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "5) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea) – £325,000 a week\nArsenal copped for around 30% of Sterling’s salary when he was on loan at the Emirates last season but he’s all Chelsea’s problem now. The Blues are working to find a solution but you can’t blame Sterling for sitting tight until he’s paid what he is contractually owed.",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money, but we remain to see if that remains the case through the deal he recently penned to stay for two more seasons.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. United have tried to shift his salary off their books but with a year to go, so far, there have been no takers. Sounds like a job for the Saudi lads.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. The new deal earned the striker a £2.6million-a-year pay rise and though £41million over two years might terrify the weirdos who think a footballer is finished at 30, it would have cost a sh*te sight more to replace him.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",
      "",
      "Salah has taken exception to a social media post criticising his former team-mates Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz.",
      "There are now four big names at the top of the Premier League Golden Boot betting.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an assist against Newcastle. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",

      "The transfer window is closed, but we’re not quite ready to give up on transfer features just yet. Not when the alternative is international break fixtures and having to think about how on earth we go about doing an England Ladder in a world where Ruben Loftus-Cheek is back in the mix.",
      "So we will continue milking the window for all its worth until the very last drop.",
      "Here we take a look at a few of the more obvious holes and gaps and in some cases meteorite-contact craters that were left unfilled in Premier League squads when the window slammed so dramatically shut and once again, despite it having been around for so very long, caught a lot of teams apparently by surprise.",
      "",
      "It’s a tricky balancing act, when you think about it, getting the right mix of goalkeepers in your squad.",
      "You obviously want good goalkeepers and one excellent one, ideally. Your second-choice needs to be someone who can come into the team without prompting mass panic. And then there’s the third-choice, who should in a perfect world be a cheerful veteran playing out his final days in the professional game and living his very best life.",
      "The key, really, lies in getting the right gap between your first and second-choice keepers. The second-choice keeper needs to be good enough to keep the first-choice honest, but without creating unnecessary confusion. Proper competition for places is good, generally, but keeper is a position where you really want a bit of reliability and certainty.",
      "Liverpool, of course, had got it perfect in recent years with the elite world-class number one in Alisson, and then a very good but clearly not quite as good back-up in Caoimhin Kelleher. And even Liverpool couldn’t sustain it forever as Kelleher’s understandable desire to be first-choice somewhere grew undeniable.",
      "Manchester United do not have it, and on deadline day they made it even more confusing. In Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and now Senne Lammens, United have three goalkeepers who will all believe they could or should be first choice. Even the bit they had right – cheerful veteran third-choice keeper – is blown apart because Tom Heaton is now fourth-choice. What a mess.",
      "United did not need to create further confusion in a vital position that has already cost them this season and did so frequently last season.",
      "Had they bought a Donnarumma or a Martinez, it could still have all gone wrong but there would at least have been clarity about who the first-choice keeper was.",
      "Lammens is highly-rated and may in time be the long-term solution. But expecting that to happen quickly is wing-and-a-prayer stuff. Not for the first time in recent years, the United brains trust has afforded itself the luxury of a transfer with an eye on the future when this is a club and team that needs real-time solutions right now.",
      "It’s nice to set yourself up to be judged on the future rather than the present, because the future never comes. But United are drowning in waters they’ve just needlessly muddied.",
      "We really do think that United and City would both benefit from a swap deal.",
      "",
      "Liverpool enjoyed one of the most outrageous transfer windows ever and it really does seem churlish to nitpick. But there remains a non-zero chance that devoting so much energy to the cherry-on-top signing of Alexander Isak to bolster an already absurdly overpowered Premier League champion attack while leaving a deal for Marc Guehi until the very last minute might appear an error in priorities.",
      "Liverpool have left themselves riskily short at the back, even if Ibrahima Konate was currently operating at the top of his game. Which he is not. Guehi was not just a squad option; he would have instantly improved Liverpool’s first XI.",
      "Joe Gomez is still there as a versatile utility option to fill in gaps where they may appear in the back four, but for all their dizzying quality across the pitch, now Liverpool do appear alarmingly reliant on a 34-year-old Virgil van Dijk being able to play pretty much all of the football – and there is so very much of that football – for at least the next four months.",
      "Given the outlay Liverpool have made elsewhere – and we’re not knocking any of that because we are giddily excited about watching what this team produces – that just seems a daftly unnecessary position to have put themselves in.",
      "And the argument that Liverpool had done what they needed to do to remedy it with Guehi just doesn’t really wash; if you leave such a vital deal until the very last minute you always leave yourself at the mercy of a transfer chain breaking down with a potentially devastating domino effect.",
      "",
      "Spurs’ centre-back hole is perhaps less immediately conspicuous than Liverpool’s because they have two unquestioned top-tier starters in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, as well as slightly less lofty ambitions for the season as a whole.",
      "What they don’t really have is anything much else if or far more realistically when either/both of those two is unavailable. And while both that pair are top-class performers on the pitch, neither has really proved themselves too reliable at getting on that pitch 50+ times a season.",
      "Romero is in his fifth season at Spurs and has only once managed more than 27 Premier League games. Last season he featured in less than half Spurs’ 38 games.",
      "Van de Ven and his rubber-band hamstrings have played in 43 of Spurs’ 79 Premier League games since joining in the summer of 2023.",
      "Kevin Danso is a perfectly capable third-choice centre-back, and when everybody’s fit also provides Thomas Frank with the back-three option he deployed against PSG.",
      "Beyond that, though, Spurs find themselves relying on Ben Davies. We love Ben Davies, but a Champions League club should not be relying on Ben Davies in big 2025. After that, it looks like poor Archie Gray getting thrown in at the deep end again.",
      "Easy to see why Spurs enquired about Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake at City; harder to see why they didn’t really seem to try much else when neither of those avenues proved productive.",
      "",
      "Hard to escape the notion that 49ers Enterprises have let Leeds and Daniel Farke down in the closing days of the window.",
      "There was a lot of promising early work after promotion, with a clear priority for signing some really big lads. A policy we can all get behind for any promoted team embarking on a survival mission.",
      "But even as that process was taking place there was a curious lack of attackers among that collection.",
      "Goalkeeper, defence and midfield were all strengthened really quite impressively, but it’s going to mean nothing if Leeds can’t put the ball in the net.",
      "Sure, having concerns about Patrick Bamford’s injury record and deciding to replace him with Dominic Calvert-Lewin is very funny and everyone likes funny, but this is serious business, lads. It’s no time for banter and whimsy.",
      "Leeds have left themselves dangerously short of creativity and attacking quality in a league where staying in games and frustrating opponents really can only take you so far.",
      "Farke and his team have shown across a challenging first three games that they can certainly compete – even against Arsenal they kept them at arm’s length pretty easily for over half-an-hour before a Classic Set-Piece Goal – but one goal from a contentious penalty in 270 minutes tells a story.",
      "One point against Newcastle was perfectly good, but it could so clearly have been three with just a bit more attacking oomph.",
      "And while Arsenal away is not a fixture upon which Leeds’ season stands or falls, what was alarming there was not really the unflattering final scoreline but the complete and total inability to get out and try to land any kind of punch of their own. The sight of a team with giants in defence and midfield launching the ball to Dan James, Willy Gnonto and Joel Piroe and watching it come straight back every time was borderline comical.",
      "Farke said he needed two attacking players in the closing days of the window and he was right. He got none. It might cost him and Leeds everything.",
      "",
      "Never ask a woman her age, a man his salary, or a Newcastle fan how Yoane Wissa engineered his deadline-day move to Tyneside.",
      "There’s a very decent case that Brentford’s most conspicuous and damaging black hole is to be found in the dugout where Keith Andrews (for now) occupies Thomas Frank’s big chair. But on the field they’ve been decimated with the two leaders of last year’s attack in Bryan Mbeumo and Wissa off to pastures new.",
      "The wide-forward positions have been addressed in numbers at least – although Brentford do seem to have ended up with a large collection of players who would by choice operate from the left.",
      "Igor Thiago has thus far stepped up gamely to his new first-choice role through the middle with two Premier League goals and another in the Carabao, but he is literally the only centre-forward left in Brentford’s squad, with none of their ragbag collection of wingers and wide forwards particularly compelling ‘Could do a job through the middle, at a push’ candidates.",
      "There could be worrying amounts of unconvincing Kevin Schade false-ninery ahead for the Bees.",
      "Crystal Palace have revealed their new asking price for Liverpool target Marc Guehi ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Marc Guehi is reportedly angry that his move to Liverpool fell through at the final hurdle but an upcoming payday plus his previous actions make it hard to have too ...",
      "Liverpool fans continue the net spend chat while wondering aloud if they should have signed Marc Guehi rather than Alexander Isak.",
      "Premier League rivals Leeds and Sunderland chose to reject the signing of new Man Utd goalkeeper Senne Lammens in the summer, according to reports.",
      "If it was Isak’s decision to strike or not, it does not matter for while he takes a public battering, football’s biggest influencers counts their millions.",

      "In the Premier League, United reportedly received ‘enquiries’ from Everton, Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa.",
      "However, Amorim’s side ‘wanted him to stay and fight for his place’, as his chances of a departure were severely reduced after injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Burnley.",
      "Let’s have a look at the six clubs the England midfielder could have joined on deadline day, shall we?",
      "One of the biggest losers of the 2025 summer transfer window, Unai Emery did get his paws on Harvey Elliott on deadline day, but Mainoo would’ve been an outstanding addition, even if it was a straight loan.",
      "We like this a lot, considering Villa’s England contingent of Ollie Watkins, Morgan Rogers and Ezri Konsa, on top of Amadou Onana and Boubacar Kamara’s injury problems.",
      "Out of all three English clubs, this strikes us as the best fit for Mainoo. I guess we’ll never know.",
      "We love this. The best team in Serie A. Managed by Antonio Conte. In the Champions League. But mostly, there are some players in Naples that Mainoo is familiar with.",
      "Scott McTominay was named Serie A Most Valuable Player after leading Napoli to the title last term, proving that the grass is very much greener on the other side. McTominay was officially joined by Rasmus Hojlund on Monday, but that deal was agreed long before.",
      "In terms of midfield competition, Mainoo would be battling for game time with the Scot and his international team-mate Billy Gilmour, as well as Frank Anguissa and Stanislav Lobotka. And if Conte viewed him as a more advanced midfield option, he’d be competing with Kevin De Bruyne…",
      "Thomas Frank’s attacking is looking strong and the deadline day addition of Randal Kolo Muani has done him no harm in that department.",
      "But in midfield, there was room for more recruitment, especially if Yves Bissouma is to remain out in the cold. Champions League football is on offer at Spurs, who do feel like a good fit for Mainoo.",
      "Everton are becoming exciting to watch following the addition of Jack Grealish, who complements Iliman Ndiaye very well. His quick renaissance under David Moyes should be a positive sign for any player looking to get their career back on track, and while Mainoo’s too young to worry about his career falling by the wayside, it would’ve been in his thinking had the Toffees’ interest intensified.",
      "James Garner and Idrissa Gana Gueye are fine midfielders, but there’s no doubt that Mainoo would be an upgrade on both. We just couldn’t see him going for it, with European football on offer everywhere else.",
      "Again, Mainoo will be familiar with one player at Marseille, Mason Greenwood. But they signed Matt O’Riley from Brighton instead of pushing for the United man.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is another head coach a player like Mainoo could benefit from working with. The Italian does have some solid Ligue 1 midfielders already, like Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Angel Gomes, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Arthur Vermeeren.",
      "Not as sure about Roma, but working under Gian Piero Gasperini is an exciting proposition. Their midfield is significantly thinner, though Manu Kone is a super player.",
      "Real Madrid are now ‘one step away’ from completing the signing of Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo on deadline day, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will only allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford before the deadline if they can bring in a replacement first, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has clarified Kobbie Mainoo’s transfer stance amid conflicting reports as a standoff between the Man Utd midfielder and the club brews.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is demanding a loan move before the transfer deadline with numerous clubs interested, according to reports."

      "Unai Emery’s side had targeted Lammens on deadline day amid uncertainty surrounding the future of first-choice goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Man United had registered interest in signing the Belgian shot-stopper earlier last month but didn’t agree a deal until the final hours of the summer transfer window.",
      "There was the possibility of Martinez ending up at Old Trafford and Villa replacing him with Lammens, but the former has stayed at Villa Park despite making it clear he wanted to leave back in May.",

      "F365 SAYS: Man Utd and Man City are signing goalkeepers ill-suited to who and where they are",
      "Andre Onana has been the club’s first choice since the start of 2023/24, but Amorim has preferred Altay Bayindir at the start of the season, keeping faith in the Turkish international after a mistake led to the only goal of the game in their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "Bayindir started at Fulham and then against Burnley on Saturday as United earned their first win of the season.",
      "It’s unclear who Amorim’s long-term No.1 will be, but the expectation is that Lammens will have to work for the shirt.",
      "He might not have to work that hard, though. Amorim clearly doesn’t rate Onana and Bayindir is worryingly error-prone.",

      "It’s been a miserable start to 2025/26 for them, and their transfer business hasn’t given the fans much to be excited about.",
      "The goalkeeper deadline day debacle rubbed salt in the wounds for the club’s supporters, with Lammens joining United for a fee below what the Villans offered Antwerp.",
      "That’s according to the Daily Mail, where it’s claimed that Lammens joined United for £18.2m plus £3.5m in add-ons, and pushed for his ‘dream move’ to Old Trafford that left Martinez in limbo and Villa feeling ‘bitter’ after making a ‘higher’ bid.",
      "It all comes down to ‘pulling power’, which still gives the Red Devils ‘a crucial advantage in the transfer window’, despite back-to-back all-time worst Premier League seasons.",
      "Other examples cited are Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who both snubbed interest from elsewhere to move to Old Trafford.",
      "After joining the Red Devils, Lammens said: “In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.”",

      "Alexander Isak joins new Liverpool team-mate Florian Wirtz in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "There are so many honourable mentions. We have many players we really like, but couldn’t find space for.",
      "Transfers like Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal, Gianluigi Donnarumma to Manchester City, Granit Xhaka to Sunderland, and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool all miss out, but are all fantastic deals in our eyes. It’s just that these ten are a little bit better.",
      "Anyway, let’s get to it. Here are our top ten Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "We loved this move before Grealish registered two assists on his Everton debut against Brighton. And then another brace of assists away to Wolves, heavily contributing to two wins in a row for David Moyes’ side.",
      "Fans across the country will agree that it’s bloody fantastic to see Grealish playing regularly and enjoying his football again. After becoming a robotic player under Pep Guardiola, he can now express himself and be the player we all know and love. Moyes will give Grealish the platform to succeed and influence a side in need of more flair. Iliman Ndiaye can only do so much. Speaking of which, that’s one exciting duo.",
      "Signed on a season-long loan, the 29-year-old has given him the best chance of making Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for next summer’s World Cup. And if all goes to plan, Everton will view his £50million buy option as a no-brainer.",
      "",
      "One of the most promising wingers in the world, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a genuine Brazilian wonderkid make the jump to the Premier League, rather than Real Madrid or Barcelona. The hype might not be the same as it was for Neymar, but that’s probably because he hasn’t made the traditional move to one of La Liga’s juggernauts.",
      "A warm-up injury to Cole Palmer on matchday two saw Estevao come into the Chelsea starting XI against West Ham, and he looked very, very dangerous. The 18-year-old assisted compatriot and fellow new signing Joao Pedro and his scary pace, confidence and dribbling ability will make him a nightmare for full-backs. And he’s only going to get better.",
      "Bought from Palmeiras for under £30m, Estevao will prove to be one of the biggest bargains of a crazy 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Cunha is a great player who Manchester United might destroy. They’ve got previous. Lots of it.",
      "Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season, earning a move to the biggest club in England, to play as one of Ruben Amorim’s ‘wide 10s’, a position he seems perfectly suited for.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling at Old Trafford because he’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "Pedro’s brace against his boyhood club Fluminense at the Club World Cup left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive philosophy with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves registered 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances for the Midlands side, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Emi Martinez takes the gloves in our post-transfer window Premier League Stuck Man XI\n👉 Liverpool extend lead as the world’s 10 biggest spenders of 2025 summer transfer window after Isak\n👉 Guehi ‘screwed’ by Palace and why Liverpool spending £400m is different to Chelsea and Man City",
      "",
      "Just like with Cunha, the fact that Mbeumo has joined Manchester United means we have reservations.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "This is a big upgrade on Arsenal’s previous No.6, with Zubimendi bringing a calming presence and outstanding levels of consistency to Mikel Arteta’s midfield. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "His first three games against Manchester United, Leeds and Liverpool have shown promise, and the fact Zubimendi will help Martin Odegaard get back to his best, while Declan Rice continues to be an attacking threat, makes him a priceless addition.",
      "",
      "A lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. It’s already started.",
      "Wirtz’s start hasn’t been the best, but he’s allowed a settling-in period, even if his transfer fee was a club-record signing.",
      "When the German does settle into his Liverpool role, we’re expecting him to be one of the best attacking midfielders in the league, if not the best. He’s one of the main reasons the Reds are the biggest winners of the window.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "",
      "Nico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality. He’s more of an Ilkay Gundogan successor.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside to this deal.",
      "",
      "The saga to end all sagas. We’re delighted it’s over, and pretty surprised it took until Deadline Day for it to be finalised.",
      "Isak cost Liverpool a British record £135m and while new team-mates surround him, the settling-in period is probably limited to one or two games, having broke that record, and come from another Premier League team. For Newcastle, the Swede scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances. He’s joined the champions and a team that wants to attack, attack, attack, so we can see Isak joining the 100 Club before or during 2027/28.",
      "There is a lot of pressure, especially considering how Isak manufactured his move to Anfield. We’re fairly confident he’ll be just fine, and his addition makes Arne Slot’s side the favourites for every competition they’re in this season.",
      "READ NEXT: The most expensive XI in Premier League history passes £1bn after Liverpool finally spend Coutinho money",

      "Did Florian Wirtz look like a British record transfer player as Liverpool played Newcastle? Plus, Unai Emery sack chat.",
      "Wirtz’s bow, the start of Chelsea’s title challenge and Sesko v Gyokeres before calls for Arteta’s sacking. The Premier League is back and we could not be more giddy…",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpool’s huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",

      "And perhaps most importantly, all but one member of the back seat on the school bus crew left the club, with only Tyrell Malacia remaining following the summer exits of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "So not too bad overall, though the continuation of last season’s misery under Ruben Amorim in the early weeks of this campaign suggests they are still miles off the leading pack and have no chance of meeting Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s set target of winning the Premier League by 2028.",
      "To put Man Utd on track to achieve this aim, Ratcliffe has been a busy man as he’s alienated himself to the point where he’s rivalling the Glaser family in terms of unpopularity at Old Trafford following several brutal and/or needless decisions, notably the so-called implementation of a “world-class” recruitment team after years of “very poor” transfer business.",
      "Ratcliffe is right in saying that Man Utd’s recruitment, overall, has been extremely dour post-Sir Alex-Ferguson, though he and his supposed dream team of experts, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, are far from perfect.",
      "This has been exposed in The Athletic‘s annual exposé of Man Utd’s business via their ‘inside the transfer window’, which has revealed a couple of gems from this summer.",
      "Firstly, we have Wilcox’s verdict on Man Utd’s top priority for the summer window.",
      "‘The choice at that stage was to go for a No 6 or a No 9. Some at the club believe a midfielder should have been the priority, but Wilcox advocated to sign a scorer, after United’s record of 44 Premier League goals last campaign, and Ratcliffe backed that call.’",
      "There is a semblance of logic to Wilcox’s stance, with the lack of goal threat needing to be addressed after Man Utd became especially toothless in attack following the implementation of Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "But as poor as Joshua Zirkzee and especially Rasmus Hojlund were last season, a contributing factor to their woes was the absence of a creative spark in Man Utd’s side to forge chances.",
      "The arrivals of Mbeumo and Cunha ease this issue, and while an upgrade in the No.9 position was needed, it was a mistake to spend £200m on attackers and completely ignore the No.6 department, which is equally in need of fixing.",
      "Carlos Baleba would have been the perfect solution and he could still prove to be that in January or next summer, though United’s period of punishment is to continue as long as they are without a selfless protector and well-rounded midfield partnership.",
      "Further forward, the return of a proven Premier League striker to take some of the pressure off Sesko, Hojlund and/or Zirkzee, but Ratcliffe wasn’t playing ball.",
      "‘Ratcliffe was known to feel United could not sanction a two-year deal for [Danny Welbeck], who is 35 in November, and instead a one plus one was discussed, but the offer was not formalised.’",
      "Sesko, like Hojlund, could easily end up faltering amid the overwhelming pressure of carrying Man Utd’s frontline from a young age, but his chances of succeeding would be greater if there were a Welbeck-type player for him to lean on for support.",
      "Welbeck would have been a cheap and risk-free signing as he’s been the model professional throughout his career, and his recent renaissance suggests he is still capable of delivering on and off the pitch for United.",

      "A Stuck Man? A stuck man. The transfer window is closed and that always, always, always catches certain clubs and players by surprise. Twice a year you’re always left with some unfortunate players in seatless limbo when the music stops.",
      "This year, thanks in large part to Emi Martinez’s heroic tragicomic antics they exist in sufficient numbers and of the requisite types to fashion an entire semi-coherent team of players waking up this morning thinking ‘now what?’ and hoping beyond hope that – like a balding Essex man in his mid-30s – Turkey might provide some hope.",
      "Yes, the good old late-closing Turkish transfer window – and that in Saudi Arabia – means escape routes might yet materialise for some, but for now here’s the current Premier League Stuck Man XI.",
      "",
      "Thought he’d wangled himself a move to the Manchester United circus, but instead is left inside the tent p*ssing here, there and everywhere at Villa, where his final meaningful on-field act still really might be the red card at Old Trafford on the final day of last season that played such a key role in Aston Villa missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "It already looks like a massive sliding-doors moment for both player and club. In a bad way. We’d imagine Villa will still want him gone if there’s any way of doing so, meaning Turkish and Saudi clubs might be sniffing a bargain.",
      "",
      "The right-back’s January arrival was somewhat overshadowed by Villa’s flashier winter loan moves, but with his path to the first team blocked by Matty Cash there was plenty of talk in the summer about some pretty eye-catching teams across the continent weighing up moves that never materialised for a man whose main chances of Villa action will likely be restricted to Europa League and domestic cup competitions.",
      "We don’t imagine he’s heartbroken to still be at Villa, but with Sevilla, Real Betis and top-flight clubs in both Germany and Italy interested it would be surprising if his head hadn’t been at least slightly turned by the prospect of more regular football in some of those places.",
      "",
      "Look, we’re not going to just try and make all of these ‘maybe a Turkish club saves the day’ but this is another one that really does look like it might need a Turkish club to save the day after a proposed loan move to Elche collapsed as the clock ticked down.",
      "Some unwanted Stuck Men scream Turkish big three. Malacia, we would suggest, screams ‘whichever club is currently trying to muscle in and disrupt that big three’. Trabzonspor or some such. We don’t know, we’ve not looked into it. But Tyrell probably should.",
      "",
      "Spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but now returns to his previous status as a fully paid-up member of the Chelsea Bomb Squad.",
      "Plenty of reports suggest Disasi had Premier League options late in the window, but they were more of the Bournemouth and Wolves and West Ham variety. Personally, we’d have been pretty keen to explore that Bournemouth option but we can see why the other two carried less appeal than sitting around collecting pay-cheques at Cobham with Raheem Sterling.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Neom have been linked because obviously.",
      "",
      "We do feel sorry for him, but not that sorry. It must be desperately hard to think that big dream move to the Premier League champions and current favourites is happening only for the rug to be pulled at the last minute, but the idea that Palace did anything unreasonable here is a daftness.",
      "Liverpool started the summer complaining about Trent Alexander-Arnold and ended it complaining that Palace didn’t simply let them have their captain without a suitable replacement being sourced first, and spent their time in between those two events bullying all manner of smaller clubs into all manner of stunning transfer successes for the Reds.",
      "They – and Guehi – will simply have to accept this rare defeat. And on Guehi’s part, the disappointment should be tempered by knowing he’s been a model pro who gave his all for Palace until the very end – something, ultimately, not even Eberechi Eze was prepared to do – and there will be no humiliating and difficult reintegration process to be completed here.",
      "And in January and especially next summer, Guehi will have full control of his future while also almost certainly being England’s first-choice World Cup centre-back.",
      "There are people in this team in a far worse pickle, is what we’re saying here.",
      "",
      "P*ssed off Thomas Frank from the very start with his shoddy timekeeping leading to an internal ban from the Super Cup against PSG, and despite now being available he appears to have dropped firmly to the very bottom of a midfield pecking order that also features Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur, Pape Sarr, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.",

      "Phillips, who at 29 still has a faintly absurd three years left on his City contract, now faces four months at least in the wilderness and suffering the indignity of being stripped of his shirt number entirely and not being registered in either City’s Premier League or Champions League squads despite them having the space to do so.",

      "Alas, Spurs have cruelly denied us this dream scenario with a rare and unhelpful display of transfer competence. But it does seem awful careless of Chelsea not to have found someone to take Sterling off their hands for a bit. There were enough desperate Premier League clubs still stumbling blindly around on deadline day waving their chequebooks at anything that moved for something to have happened, surely.",

      "Can you be stuck at a team you only joined on a permanent deal two months earlier? Yes. Yes you can. Larsen proved himself a solidly reliable Premier League striker last season with 14 goals on loan from Celta Vigo last season more than enough for Wolves to trigger the buy option in that deal.",
      "But proving yourself a solidly reliable Premier League striker with 14 goals made Larsen an enormously valuable commodity in this economy, one where Newcastle were absolutely desperate to pre-spend the massive Alexander Isak windfall we all – with one definitely not rattled exception – strongly suspected was coming their way.",
      "Larsen was keen on the move but still scored two goals in a very funny Carabao win over West Ham, but then sat out the Premier League defeat to Everton as Wolves held firm and Newcastle instead spent all their pocket money on Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa instead.",

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund ‘considers himself better’ than summer signing Benjamin Sesko after signing for Napoli on loan, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils chose to sign a new striker over a midfielder in the final month of the transfer market with Sesko arriving from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m.",
      "Hojlund joined his boyhood club Man Utd in 2023 for £72m from Serie A side Atalanta but he failed to hit the ground running at Old Trafford.",
      "The Denmark international managed a very respectable 10 Premier League goals in 30 appearances in his first season but the 22-year-old could only manage four goals in 31 matches last term.",
      "Hojlund was linked all summer with a move away from Old Trafford and he pushed back on leaving during the transfer window as he looked to remain at Man Utd.",
      "He told reporters during pre-season: “My plan is very clear. That is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "“Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.”",
      "Hojlund added: “When I came, [Anthony] Martial was there as well but he had a lot of injuries, so I obviously had to take a lot of the game time",
      "“You’re not going to tell me I shouldn’t be playing because I want to play every game. But obviously I could have done with some help in terms of sharing the games a bit, especially in the beginning.”",
      "Hojlund continued to plead his case for staying at Man Utd, he said: “I’m still very young. People forget that sometimes. I’m only 22. Not every striker scores 100 goals by that age.",
      "“But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see it in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Last season was tough on us all. I should have done better, everybody knows.",
      "“But it’s also a team thing. We’re going to be better now. We are progressing in the right way and looking forward to what’s coming.”",
      "Napoli eventually agreed a loan move for Hojlund with the Danish striker staying until the end of the season and Man Utd included a  €44m buy option which will turn into an obligation if the Serie A side qualify for the Champions League.",
      "And now The Athletic have revealed that one of the reasons he was looking to stay and fight for his place was his belief that he is better than new signing Sesko.",
      "The Athletic wrote: ‘Part of Hojlund’s motivation, it can be revealed, was that he considers himself better than the centre-forward United have agreed to pay €85million for. He felt showing that in sessions might give Amorim pause for thought on his departure, despite Sesko’s arrival.’",
      "The potential end of his time at Old Trafford has been a sad time for Hojlund, the report added: ‘Hojlund was said to be heartbroken over the realisation his Old Trafford dream was over aged 22, especially when he started pre-season expecting to continue. The episode demonstrates how Ratcliffe, Berrada, Wilcox and Amorim are operating without sentiment.’",

      "‘At Old Trafford, who are not exactly flush with talent, they maintain that they have lost a great player and that they have ended up ‘giving him away’, something that confirms the crisis that the Mancunians are currently experiencing, both on and off the pitch, and that has very close to sacking Rúben Amorim, who still hasn’t found the key, despite having spent surprising amounts of money in the transfer market that has just closed.’",

That’s why we’re in the position we’re in now.",

      "Jamie Carragher has argued that there is a one reason behind Manchester United’s decision to stick with head coach Ruben Amorim amid a “big clamour”.",
      "Amorim is under immense pressure at Man Utd as he is currently the second-favourite to be the first Premier League manager sacked this season.",
      "The 40-year-old had a torrid time after replacing former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 as he struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Under Amorim, the Red Devils plummeted to 15th in the Premier League and they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final, while their problems have carried over into this campaign.",

      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "Carragher has commented on Amorim’s situation, claiming he would have “lost his job earlier” if he “wasn’t such a good-looking man”.",
      "“There is now a big clamour to get Jose Mourinho back in English football and the reason is because he’s box office, he comes out with stuff, but he was a winner. We always remember Brian Clough – when I was a kid and he was speaking you’d listen because he was a winner,” Carragher claimed on The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "“The problem with Ruben Amorim is that he’s great in the press conferences but because he’s not winning, people are thinking, ‘Oh, shut up. Stop speaking.’ But if he was winning, we’d all be thinking he’s a great character and personality.",
      "“If he wasn’t so charismatic in the press conference, and wasn’t such a good-looking man, he might have lost his job a lot earlier. When you look at the results, they are horrendous.”",
      "Carragher also credited Amorim for his achievements at Sporting Lisbon, though he did name two other Premier League managers who are “better” than the current Man Utd boss.",
      "“He said something in the press conference – ‘I will nail this system down so the players can play it with their eyes closed’, I think he said – I don’t think he’ll get the time to do that if he doesn’t start getting results,” Carragher added.",
      "“He’s still a very young manager – what he did at Sporting Lisbon, we shouldn’t write off because that was a brilliant achievement when you think of Benfica and Porto in that league. To win the [Portuguese] league a couple of times with Sporting is a huge achievement.",
      "“Take Unai Emery and Eddie Howe. They’re not managers that are going for the league, but they are good managers.",
      "“To think this guy [Amorim] has got all the answers to get Manchester United back to the top when there are managers that aren’t even going for the league and are more experienced, there are a lot of better managers in the Premier League, and I think it’s going to be tough for him to turn it around.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is safe for now but the Red Devils have decided what would ‘prove fatal’ for the head coach this season, according to reports.",

      "Jamie Carragher has revealed the Liverpool attack that he would favour playing for the rest of the season after Alexander Isak signed on deadline day.",
      "Losing at home to West Ham has left Nuno Espirito Santo in some quite considerable trouble. Even more than Ruben Amorim.",
      "Jamie Carragher has slammed Mikel Arteta after Arsenal’s defeat to Liverpool: “Heavily reliant on set-pieces, don’t create anything in open play.”",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble."

      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 23:16, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on the final day.",
      "Within that there were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis respectively, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "1) Is the squad better now, than the one that ended last season?",
      "2) Did they get all of their primary marquee targets?",
      "3) Did each of the signings fit the club's new parameters in terms of age, profile and cost?",
      "4) Did they manage to move on those high-earning players that are not part of Amorim's plans?",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident that they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and some pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "Manchester United have completed a £18.2m deal to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens; the Belgian shot stopper is now one of four goalkeepers at Man Utd, though they could sell any of the other goalkeepers to Saudi Arabia or Turkey as their windows close later",
      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed the Deadline Day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "United have agreed a deal for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper for around £18.2m plus add-ons.",
      "The club looked at other options, including Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but after much deliberation and negotiation, they feel Lammens is the right choice for the club moving forward.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper impressed United. No 'keeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10, respectively.",
      "It is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for their other goalkeepers, it would be considered.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim had previously said he was happy with his goalkeeping department, despite several high-profile errors from Onana and Bayindir across the early stages of the season.",
      "Lammens is now the fifth signing of the summer for Amorim, taking their summer spend to £232m, following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The keeper was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and the sale represents nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.",
      "He made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season for Antwerp, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "Speaking on the club's official channels after signing, Lammens said:",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential.",
      "\"We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "\"Manchester United have signed Senne Lammens with an eye to the now as well as the future.",
      "\"The 23-year-old keeper, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department after a shaky start to the season by the likes of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp, United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years time.\"",
      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",
      "\"An interesting thing is that when Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, they were tracking him then. So there's obviously been a like there for quite some time.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""

      "Clubs also set a record for the amount of money recouped from player sales at £1.8bn. The buying and selling added up to an all-time-high net spend of £1.2bn.",

      "At the other end of the scale, Bournemouth emerged from the window £65.8m in the black after selling a raft of star players, including defenders Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Isak was the most expensive signing of the window at a British-record £125m, followed by Florian Wirtz at £116.5m, while Hugo Ekitike (£79m, Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool), Benjamin Sesko (£73.7m, RB Leipzig to Man Utd), and Bryan Mbeumo (£71m, Brentford to Man Utd) also made big-money moves.Adam Smith",
      "It seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.",
      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",

      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",
      "Brighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.",
      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",

      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",

      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",

Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",

      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",

      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "Bruno Fernandes scored a dramatic, controversial 97th-minute penalty as Manchester United scraped past Burnley 3-2 in a game that Ruben Amorim had called a \"must-win\".",
      "The United boss declared that \"something had to change\" after their embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby in midweek, but this was more of the same failings that have plagued the Amorim era.",
      "Twice they led, twice they were pegged back by Burnley, but Fernandes stepped up in injury time after VAR spotted a shirt pull on Amad Diallo and dispatched the penalty kick.",
      "Man Utd: Bayindir (5), Yoro (7), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Dalot (7), Fernandes (7), Casemiro (7), Amad (8), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (6), Mount (8)\n\n\nSubs: Mainoo (7), Sesko (6)\n\n\nBurnley: Dubravka (8), Walker (5), Hartman (6), Esteve (6), Ekdal (6), Ugochukwu (6), Anthony (7), Cullen (7), Hannibal (6), Bruun Larsen (6), Foster (7)\n\n\nSubs: Worral (6), Laurent (6), Sonne (6)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Amad",
      "In the 97th minute, referee Sam Barrott awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Burnley penalty area for a foul on Amad, who appeared to have his shirt pulled by Burnley winger Jaidon Anthony after a neat one-two with Fernandes.",
      "Barrott was then told to review the decision by VAR Stuart Atwell. After a three-minute review, Barrott awarded a penalty for a \"sustained pulling action\" from Anthony on Amad. The shirt pull started outside the penalty area.",
      "Burnley boss Scott Parker was unable to hide his frustration at full-time: \"It's the way the game is going. It's going to become the most sterile game there is. We're probably months or a year away from not celebrating goals.",
      "\"I stand on the touchline, you score a goal and I feel like there's a million things go through your mind, a checklist, was it offside? Did he step on his toe two minutes before? We need to get a computer out.\"",
      "United were denied a penalty early on in the game when Kyle Walker appeared to have had a hold of Mason Mount's shirt in the area.",
      "Similar to the later penalty that was awarded, the contact began outside of the area before the pair ended up on the floor in the area.",
      "In this case, Barrott awarded the penalty; however, following a five-minute review and being advised to check the screen, the on-field decision was overturned with a drop-ball awarded to the Clarets.",
      "\"When Kyle Walker makes initial contact, he's about a foot outside of the area, so I think it might be overturned and given a free-kick outside [the penalty area]. The actual contact is on the back of his calf and it's outside the area.",
      "\"If it's outside, it's factual [so it should be overturned]. It's in or out. So for me it's a free-kick for United from outside the area, in my opinion.\n\"The initial contact was outside and then he's fallen inside. I don't know if they're looking at a foul the other way or something. I don't know why they're taking so long.",
      "\"I've frozen it, it's just outside, if it is outside, they won't have to go to the screen. It's factual, in or out. Just overturn the decision.\"",
      "A Josh Cullen own goal looked to have put United on their way after a fast start but an injury to Matheus Cunha and a hatful of missed chances kept Burnley in the game.",
      "Lyle Foster equalised from a Jacob Bruun Larsen cross but Bryan Mbeumo, who missed the key penalty in the shootout loss at Grimsby, scored just 15 seconds later for his first league goal for his new club.",
      "At 2-1 down, Burnley thought they were level as Foster capped a fine move only for his effort to be ruled out for offside.",
      "United were never comfortable though and Anthony scrambled home a second leveller after some timid United defending from a throw-in.",
      "Time looked to be running out for United, and potentially Amorim, but Fernandes made amends for his spot-kick miss at Fulham last weekend by keeping his nerve after VAR spotted the foul on Amad.",
      "Not that Amorim could watch it as he cut a broken figure on the touchline at various points of the match.",

      "\"Is it really important? In the future, we are going to find out.",

      "\"We have to try to fight until the last minute, things that we overcomplicate. But for me, the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what happens, we try. During the game, we try in every moment, sometimes playing well, sometimes playing too open, too fast, losing possessions.",
      "\"But the effort was there.",
      "\"I think if you look at the first half, we have so many chances to score a goal and then that can help us to control the emotions, the game, to involve the fans.",
