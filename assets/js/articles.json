      "Lee Grant takes charge of his first competitive game in management tomorrow afternoon but Huddersfield ’s new boss admits the role has already been consuming every waking minute for weeks.",
      "And the former Manchester United goalkeeper is confident he has all the knowledge to succeed because of his apprenticeship under the man he says is Britain’s best young boss.",
      "Grant, whose Terriers host Leyton Orient in their League One opener this afternoon, spent three years as an assistant to Kieran McKenna at Ipswich Town.",
      "Having helped navigate the Tractor Boys from the third tier to the promised land, Grant believes that education can only stand him in good stead – even if he is determined to be his own man.",
      "“The way he has been able to build, shape and mould Ipswich and for me having a bird’s eye view in terms of how he went about doing that was hugely influential on me,” Grant says. “I’d like to think some of his work ethic, his process and attention to detail has really rubbed off.",
      "“The real eye-opener for me heading from my playing career, where I was already dipping my toe in at Manchester United with the youth team and in the office with the manager, was once you actually step into the world of Kieran McKenna you quickly realise the dedication, the sacrifices needed to work at that level.",
      "“Perhaps my coaches can tell you better but in terms of the work ethic, demands and sacrifices needed at Huddersfield Town right now is quite significant.”",
      "Grant says he will feel a sense of pride when arriving at the Accu Stadium but come 3pm that will have washed away.",
      "“I’ve really enjoyed it so far, it’s really busy and my phone doesn’t stop,\" he says. \"It tends to be people just pestering me for players, agents and other clubs, and it’s not been easy finding time for anything else. But if I’m honest that’s what I love, throwing myself into every single part of the job.",
      "Grant also saw the methods of Jose Mourinho up close while at Old Trafford. The now Fenerbahce boss recently hit out at coaches who refuse to deviate from their game plan when situations demand flexibility.",
      "And that view chimes with Grant as he tries to develop a team capable of winning games in different ways.",
      "“I believe you need to look at every game and the challenges the opposition are going to put on you, and not be too biased by whether you’ve just won or lost at the weekend,” he says. “Having a squad that’s deep enough to offer different solutions and characteristics is really important.",
      "“It would be the perfect scenario for me if we can win a game and then I make four or five changes and win the next one as well.”",
      "He has no shortage of depth having been backed heavily in the transfer market. Eleven new faces, including goalscorer Alfie May and new captain Ryan Ledson, have come in so far with a loan move for Chelsea youngster Leo Castledine also being lined up.",
      "That sees them installed as second favourites to win the title, behind only Luton, and Grant is happy to embrace high expectations.",
      "“This club has what is required to do it,” he says. “We’ve got to work hard for it, we’re not owed anything, but we’re comfortable with the fact that we’re a good team and we want to be a good team.",
      "“If people want to give us that moniker then wonderful but we certainly have to earn it.” Words that sound awfully like McKenna.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's striker pursuit suggests they have moved on from the approach which ran throughout Erik ten Hag's time in charge. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell appears to be taking the lead in the search for a new No 9, despite Ruben Amorim's apparent preferences.",
      "United have attempted to streamline their scouting operation in an effort to bring an end to the poor recruitment of years gone by. Bad investments have left the club battling to offload high-earning stars who are surplus to requirements, and the goal this summer is to get back on the right path.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Amorim would favour a move for Ollie Watkins. He has already signed two players with Premier League experience in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and in Watkins, Amorim has his eyes on a third.",
      "However, the same publication suggests Vivell is leading a push for an alternative target in the form of Benjamin Sesko. Slovenia frontman Sesko would cost a little more - with RB Leipzig after a fee in the region of £70m - but he is several years younger than Watkins.",
      "United aren't the only ones keen on Sesko, with Newcastle keen to bring the former Red Bull Salzburg star to St James' Park. However, Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves are said to be taking a hands-on approach, with Sesko expected to make a decision in the coming days.",
      "Villa's £60m asking price for Watkins also appears to be north of what United are willing to pay. Reports earlier this week suggested they were exploring a player-plus-cash deal involving Alejandro Garnacho, but there has been no movement on that front.",
      "Sesko appears to be the top target, though. And it seems to show a level of joined-up thinking on the recruitment front which wasn't always present under previous ownership - or, indeed, in the early part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's tenure.",
      "Ratcliffe has trimmed down United's scouting team since taking charge. And now former Chelsea and RB Leipzig man Vivell - who joined permanently earlier this year after taking a temporary role during the summer 2024 transfer window - had taken a hands-on role.",
      "United have sent a number of players out on loan as they gear up for the new campaign. Marcus Rashford will spend the season at Barcelona while Dan Gore has made a temporary switch to Rotherham, and the Red Devils confirmed on Friday that Ethan Wheatley has joined Northampton on a year-long deal.",
      "\"He has played in the Premier League for Manchester United at the age of 18 and you don't do that without having a lot of ability,\" Northampton boss Kevin Nolan said after the youngster's arrival was announced. \"I have seen enough of him to know what he is all about, what his attributes are and to believe that he can come in and be a good addition for us.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has created a 'Fight Club' mentality at Manchester United as he tries to haul them off the canvas following their worst Premier League season. United ended last season in 15th place, their worst league finish for half a century, and missed out on Europe with defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League.",
      "Against that backdrop, battered and bruised United are at their lowest point since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, when he led the club to their last league title. The recovery process began with Amorim exiling five players – Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malaica - in a 'bomb squad' training away from the main group.",
      "Rashford secured a season-long loan move to Barcelona, with the remaining four left behind as Amorim took his squad on tour of the US to strengthen bonds and continue their rebirth. In the States, United have looked a different team to the rabble of last season, with players looking sharper, hungrier and committed, putting the interests of the team above their own.",
      "Wins over West Ham and Bournemouth, the latter an emphatic 4-1 victory, have suggested United will pack a punch next season, a feeling endorsed by defender Diogo Dalot. “I think straight away it's the connection between the players,” said Dalot.",
      "“I think we're now creating a group that fights for each other. I think that's what we're trying to create. Obviously, there's still a long way to go. I'm not going to say perfect because it's difficult, but that's where we want to go, towards perfection.",
      "“But obviously, I think you can see straight away, some signs of the team fighting a bit more, having more intensity and that's what we're trying to do. I think Ruben is really good as a manager in terms of trying to take the best out of you.",
      "“He's very clear in his messages that you want to be a part of the team or you cannot be here. If you want to be at Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you're not able to match it, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.",
      "“If you started pre-season, it's because he believes that we're the group that needs to come. Obviously, we had players coming in, which is always amazing. You can feel straight away that they match those standards. We're really happy with how things are going, but we're not going to get carried away by the results of what we're doing. It just has to give you motivation that when you do things right, you get the results.”",
      "Despite such a positive pre-season tour as part of the Premier League's Summer Series, Dalot knows United's players cannot afford to get carried away. They have a tough start to the new season, hosting Arsenal in their opening fixture and local rivals Manchester City three games later, then Chelsea and champions Liverpool in quick succession.",
      "But there is a new-found confidence about United in pre-season, boosted by skipper Bruno Fernandes rejecting a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League and committing himself to the team. “I think it's a clear message that he still believes that this club can go to the places that it should be,” said Dalot.",
      "“I don't think there's a better way of starting a season than your captain staying and believing that this can go in the right direction. It's a clear message for the other team-mates, for everybody, that we have to believe. We have to work really hard to put Manchester United back in the place it deserves.”",

      "Patrick Dorgu says Manchester United have returned to the club's attacking heritage and put last season's failings behind them. Dorgu was United's stand-out player in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, setting up the opener and scoring the second in an all-action display from the defender.",
      "Signed in January for £25million, Dorgu looks to have cemented his status as Ruben Amorim's first-choice left wing-back with his rampaging runs and attacking threat. And the 20-year-old is confident United will hit the ground running when the new season starts and surprise those who expect them to fall short again.",
      "“I think we will hopefully see a United team that is attacking more, that's on the front foot, that's trying to dominate every game,” said Dorgu.",
      "“We will take the rest of the pre-season to get even better. I feel like we're getting there, we're playing more as a team and we're running for each other.",
      "“You can see on the pitch that we're playing as a more active team. With the press, we run more for each other, so you can see that the pre-season has helped everyone. I feel like everyone left last season to last season and everyone is just looking forward to the new season, so everyone is positive.",
      "“I came in at a difficult moment last season and I think the team is improving a lot. It's more like a collective than an individual. I feel like everyone is positive and looking forward to the season.\"",
      "Dorgu provided the assist for United and Denmark team-mate Rasmus Hojlund to open the scoring against Bournemouth and said the goal will do wonders for the striker's confidence. United are pushing to sign £70m-rated Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, but Dorgu backed Hojlund to prove his enduring value.",
      "“He's doing really well,” said Dorgu. “He looks sharp, he looks fit and I'm very happy for Rasmus to get his goal.",
      "“It was a difficult season for Rasmus. Not only for him, but for everyone, so I think this season is really important for him and for the team to get back to where we have to be in the league.",
      "“We need a striker to deliver on the pitch, so that's why he was happy. We talk in training, we try to understand each other on the pitch, for me to know where he is in the box and what movements he likes. He needs confidence, everyone needs confidence and a goal always helps with that.”",

      "But he is edging towards a return to the side, with further progress made during United’s pre-season tour in the United States. Martinez is continuing his rehabilitation with his teammates in Chicago as he aims to return to the pitch.",
      "That means Martinez could still be sidelined for United’s Premier League opener against Arsenal in just over a fortnight.",
      "Speaking ahead of that game, Martinez said: “The club is obviously going through a process of change. Since Sir Alex Ferguson 's departure, they haven't found a manager who hits the right note. Ten Hag did a remarkable job at Ajax, which is why he went to United, and thanks to him, I joined the club as well.",
      "\"It's like everything in life: you take a gamble, and sometimes it works out well, sometimes it doesn't. I think that, like any club, if something isn't working, it needs to be changed. It's necessary to analyse what's working and what isn't and make changes accordingly because that's how great clubs operate. Manchester is one of the best clubs in the world.",
      "\"Now Ruben Amorim has arrived with very good energy and willingness. I believe he will make the necessary changes. Without a doubt change is needed, because where we ended up in the table over the last two seasons is unacceptable.\"",
      "As Martinez steps up his recovery, Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee are both back training after their own respective issues.",
      "Onana has been struggling with a hamstring strain, while Zirkzee picked up a slight issue at the start of pre-season. But both have returned to the pitch and will step up their respective recoveries over the coming week.",

      "Rossi was just 18 when Keane left United, so will have still been in his teens when the incident took place. And the Italian international, who retired in 2023, has opened up on the incident.",
      "“Keane wrote that one time in training he had told off a young Italian player for not passing him the ball and this young lad replied with a strong glare, a challenge,\" Rossi told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"If that kid had said something, he would’ve got a slap, but he was silent and his gaze spoke volumes. So he walked over to shake his hand.",
      "“Well, that kid was me. And I don’t remember it at all! Evidently I was in a trance and my determination to create a career was absolute.”",
      "Rossi had a nomadic career after leaving Old Trafford, playing in Italy, Spain and the United States. The American-born star, who won 30 caps for Italy, also reflected on working under Sir Alex Ferguson during his time in English football.",
      "“He was a surprise, because he was an austere person, but also affectionate and attentive, a paternal figure who knew how to treat young players like gems,\" Rossi said. \"He would protect and motivate them to help them grow as both people and players, with precise values and rules.",
      "“In training, it was like another sport to what I was accustomed to, this brutal pace and intensity. There were no friends in training, lots of shoves, kicks, aggression. I quickly realised what I had to do to earn respect in that squad. I was physically behind the rest, so I had to make do with technique and intelligence.”",
      "Rossi wasn't the only United newcomer to fall afoul of Keane towards the end of the captain's time in Manchester. Gabriel Heinze joined in the same summer as Rossi, back in 2004, and claimed to have been sparked out by Keane early in his spell with the club.",
      "\"The first thing you hear in English or in another language are bad words,\" Heinze, who recently joined Arsenal's coaching staff, said in 2022. \"He (Keane) was looking at me and he says to me: \"F*** off!\" And I knew that was a dirty word.",

      "Sancho has been widely linked with a move to Turin after seeing Chelsea pay a £5million penalty to avoid making his loan move permanent earlier this summer. The former Borussia Dortmund star has not been in Ruben Amorim's plans this summer as the club tour the United States.",
      "United are already said to have accepted that they will have 'no choice' but to accept a fee of less than £25million for Sancho this summer, amid negotiations with Juve. For his part, Sancho is said to be willing to slash his wages in half to facilitate an exit from Old Trafford.",
      "Momentum had seemed to be growing over a move to Serie A, with the Bianconeri said to have agreed personal terms and a fee of £15m for Sancho's services. But it emerged sales could first be required and Comolli has now confirmed as much.",

      "Andre Onana was brought in for £47m but has been inconsistent between the sticks, sparking rumours that United might be looking to recruit a new first-choice goalkeeper. With Donnarumma's future at Paris Saint Germain uncertain, despite his heroics in their Champions League winning campaign, United have been linked with an audacious move.",
      "Reports from France claim United are contemplating a move for the Euro 2020 winner. L'Equipe understands both United and Manchester City have expressed interest in bringing the Italian to their clubs after negotiations between PSG and the shot-stopper hit a wall.",
      "From United's point of view, a potential move for Donnarumma would be a significant expense, especially when they also need to bolster their attack. But if they can find the funds for him, they could offer him the No. 99 shirt.",
      "Two things would be accomplished if they did this. Firstly, he would be reunited with the unusual number he wore at AC Milan, the club he joined when he was only 14 years old. Secondly, he would become the first ever United player to wear the number.",

      "Donnarumma has also been linked with a move to Chelsea. The Blues are currently pondering on whether to stick or twist with current shot stoppers Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. Neither goalkeepers were truly convincing between the sticks last season, although the former did enjoy an impressive campaign at the Club World Cup.",

      "Diogo Dalot has paid an emotional tribute to Diogo Jota and said his compatriot and friend will be “remembered forever”. Jota and his brother Andre Silva were killed when the car in which they were travelling suffered a suspected tyre blow-out and crashed in northern Spain last month.",
      "The pair were on their way to catch a ferry from Santander, with Jota set to return for pre-season training at Liverpool, when the tragedy happened on July 3. Manchester United defender Dalot was close to Portugal team-mate Jota and revealed the emotional toll his passing – and that of his brother – had taken on everyone who knew the 28-year-old.",
      "“It's tough to talk about it,” said Dalot. “It was a tough week for me, for every team-mate that played with him. I cannot imagine what the family went through.",
      "“I had the opportunity to see them and it's just tough. I don't think there are any words to describe it when such a tragedy happens like that. It hits you.",
      "“I felt that everybody, the whole world felt it, even if they didn't know him personally. It's just a tragedy.",
      "“I think every time, at least me, I go on the pitch, I try to - even today I saw shirts with his name on and I think he will be remembered forever.",
      "“I think he deserves it because he was a great man, a great team-mate. Someone I would say was a role model for me because I always like to see a player's behaviour when you play, when you don't play.”",
      "Dalot said Jota's legacy of always putting others first will live on following his passing and said he will treasure the memories he made with his compatriot and team-mate. “He was always the guy that was thinking and putting the team first. So I will always remember him like that and hopefully he's at peace now and resting where he is.",
      "“He could have played for any team. When you're talking about the personal side, I don't look to the shirts that he represents.",
      "“Obviously I played a lot of years with him in the national team and I spent some time with him in there and I think you create a connection, you create some memories and I think that's what I want to keep, the good memories. I think it's how I want to remember it.”",

      "Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly in talks to sign former Manchester United target Joao Palhinha. The midfielder had a challenging first season at Bayern Munich, but previously excelled in the Premier League with Fulham.",
      "The 30-year-old was restricted to just six league starts for the German club during an injury-plagued campaign following his move worth up to £47.4million last summer. Palhinha was a standout performer during his two years at Craven Cottage and was reported to be a target for United and several other clubs during his time in West London.",
      "Bayern eventually won the race to sign Palhinha, having initially seen a deadline day move collapse in 2023. There has been speculation that United have reignited their interest in Palhinha this summer, but the midfielder could return to the Premier League with a different club after emerging as a target for Spurs.",
      "The Independent has reported that Tottenham have started negotiations over a possible loan move for the former Sporting Lisbon star. It is claimed that Spurs held an interest in Palhinha prior to him joining Bayern.",
      "A temporary move to Spurs could allow Palhinha to find his best form ahead of the 2026 World Cup and prove a point to Bayern boss Vincent Kompany. Tottenham are well-stocked in midfield but may wish to bolster their squad after gaining Champions League qualification through their Europa League triumph.",
      "Palhinha has previously proven to be decisive when taking the next steps in his career. Sky Germany reported that the former Fulham midfielder made it clear he would turn down any approach from United as he remained committed to joining Bayern last summer following his collapsed transfer.",
      "Fulham were reported to have demanded £60m for Palhinha, who was claimed to have attracted interest from United, Barcelona and Bayern. Nevertheless, the doubt surrounding then-United manager Erik ten Hag's position, who would pen a contract extension only to face dismissal in October, failed to improve the club's chances of swaying Palhinha.",
      "United's squandered opportunity could prove to be a boost for Spurs should Palhinha join Thomas Frank's outfit on loan. Yet the defensive midfielder will be keen to sidestep another protracted transfer ordeal, having recalled the uncomfortable predicament he faced at Fulham in 2023.",
      "\"Obviously, it affected me and my family a lot, but it's water under the bridge, I don't want to remember too much about it,\" Palhinha said of his collapsed move to Bayern. \"It's a great pride, you know what happened. In my life everything that has been happening – it has been for a reason, I like to think that way. The future will tell me whether what really happened was what had to happen or not.",
      "\"But only the future will show me that. I want to continue walking the journey as I've been doing, no one has given me anything throughout my career, everything I've achieved is earned, for my work. I hope that continues to be the case. I'm 28 years old, but I know I can reach higher and it's with this ambition that I face the future.\"",
      "England manager Thomas Tuchel praised Palhinha when he expressed regret at failing to land his midfield target. \"I was sad because I know what he would have added to our team,\" former Bayern boss Tuchel admitted.",
      "\"He was sad and disappointed. We'll speak again about what happened. Everyone did what they had to do, but it was too late in the end.\"",
      "United brought in Manuel Ugarte from Sporting during the same transfer window that saw Palhinha finally complete his switch to Bayern. The £51m midfielder, who previously played alongside Palhinha, featured in 45 matches during his first campaign at United and has been reunited with manager Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Meanwhile, Tottenham secured a 1-0 victory over north London rivals Arsenal at the Kai Tak Sports Park in Hong Kong on Thursday, with midfielder Pape Matar Sarr netting the match's only goal. The club have recruited Mohammed Kudus for £55m and confirmed permanent deals for former loanees Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel, while also capturing several promising youngsters during the summer transfer window.",

      "United are seemingly ready to swoop for Sesko, who is one of the most highly-rated forwards in Europe after some superb goalscoring displays in the Bundesliga.",
      "Amorim is desperate to add more firepower to his squad after watching them finish 15th last season and Hojlund could not help the team as he managed just four goals in the Premier League, infuriating fans in the process.",
      "There had even been reports from the Athletic that United's interest in Sesko could lead to Hojlund, signed for a whopping £72m, going the other way in a swap deal.",
      "But now the Sun has claimed that Sesko's arrival would not spell the end for Hojlund, with Amorim believing the Slovenian can actually help the former Atalanta man raise his game by giving him some serious competition.",
      "United may have to spend as much as £70m to land Sesko after making him their priority transfer target over Ollie Watkins, who is valued at £60m by Aston Villa. United felt that Sesko represented better long-term value given he is five years younger.",
      "And Amorim is increasingly positive about the prospect of Sesko joining the club and feels he can get the best out of him - just as he did with Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting Lisbon, the report adds.",
      "It says the Portuguese coach sees Sesko as the \"dynamite\" United need up front to return to the glory days after a dismal season saw them lose 17 games in the top flight.",
      "Amorim is also said to think the lack of competition in attack last season contributed to Hojlund's poor season, with Joshua Zirkzee also struggling with just three goals in the Premier League.",
      "The presence of the two players at the club would add pressure on both players to succeed, which might be a factor in Amorim keeping Hojlund for the time being. The Denmark international has been included in Amorim's pre-season plans, unlike players like Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford who have been frozen out.",
      "He showed his desire to keep progressing by scoring a brace in a 4-1 friendly win over Bournemouth, leading to praise from his manager. \"People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,’ the coach said. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long].",

      "Last season he was loaned to Chelsea but his form suffered at Stamford Bridge as he scored just three Premier League goals from 19 top flight starts.",
      "And in a brutal end to his spell with the Blues, the London side opted not to turn his move permanent for £25m - instead paying a £5m penalty fee to send him back to United.",

      "He has been strongly linked with a move to Juventus but news on that front has gone cold. Now, reports from German outlet Bild report that he has held initial conversations about a possible return to Dortmund.",

And another season at Signal Iduna Park could now be on the cards, with Sancho said to be pushing for the move.",
      "The report adds that Sancho is willing to take a huge pay cut in order to seal his return to Dortmund and would even consider dropping his current £275,000-a-week salary by half. Sancho is believed to have spoken with Dortmund chiefs Lars Ricken and Sebastian Kehl in the hopes of sealing the transfer and ending his exile at Old Trafford.",

      "Talks are supposedly underway, and a fee in the region of £70million has been mooted as the Slovenian superstar's price tag. United already spent big on a No. 9 when they signed Danish ace Hojlund from Atalanta in 2023, and it is now suggested that the 22-year-old could be included in a potential swap deal at a dramatically cut price.",
      "The Athletic report that Leipzig are one of several parties interested in taking on the out-of-sorts Hojlund, and the prospect of some form of swap deal including Sesko has been raised, though it looks unlikely at this stage.",
      "Although the 22-year-old cost the Red Devils £72m, they would have to fork out a cash sum alongside their player to secure Sesko's services in any potential swap deal.",
      "The report states that United acknowledges internally that Hojlund's market value would be nowhere near what they paid for him and currently stands a little under £45m. This is a drop of £27m in just two years since his big-money move to Old Trafford.",
      "In light of Sesko becoming United's top striker target and competition for minutes potentially becoming scarce, Hojlund was questioned about his Old Trafford future and responded bullishly.",

It's been an important part of not only my career but my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them.",

      "Chelsea star Nicolas Jackson has insisted \"I have no competition\" at Stamford Bridge as speculation links him with a move away from the club.",
      "The forward has been strongly tipped for a move to Manchester United, who are desperately seeking more firepower for the new season after Ruben Amorim grew frustrated with a lack of clinical finishing from Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "There have even been suggestions of a swap deal between Chelsea and United for Jackson and Alejandro Garnacho, who has fallen out with Amorim.",
      "Jackson had a solid season for Chelsea last term as he netted 10 times in the Premier League and chipped in with another three goals in the UEFA Conference League - scoring in the final as the team beat Real Betis 4-1 - notching 13 in 37 games in all competitions.",
      "But there have been demands from fans and pundits for Jackson to score more goals and Jackson now appears to have slipped down the pecking order after Chelsea signed Ipswich striker Liam Delap for £30m and Joao Pedro from Brighton for £60m, with the latter starring in their FIFA Club World Cup triumph.",
      "Jackson, however, has now hit back at the suggestion that the club's new signings meant that he had a battle to be first choice up front under Enzo Maresca and claimed every player \"has their role to play\".",
      "\"Competition? I have no competition,\" he told DSports TV. \"We’re all here to help the club. Everyone has their role to play. I’m on a mission. It’s up to the coach to make his choices. I focus solely on my work.\"",
      "Jackson was coy on his future and said he was focused on playing for Chelsea as things stood, saying he had no control over any \"changes\" that could come.",
      "\"I’m a Chelsea player,\" he said. \"The future belongs to God. If there are any changes, you’ll know. For now, I’m focused on my preparation. It’s football, there are ups and downs. Last season we won two trophies. There were difficult moments, moments of glory. Every season is like that. But the most important thing is to stay focused, to learn, and to grow in the face of adversity.\"",
      "Jackson has netted a total of 30 goals in 81 appearances since joining Chelsea for around £32million from Villarreal in 2023, including 17 in his first season. Despite links to United, it's understood the Red Devils have ruled out a move for Jackson because Chelsea are demanding between £80m and £100m - and have since pressed on with a move for Red Bull Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But with Villa demanding £60m for 29-year-old Watkins, United have prioritised Sesko's signature given that he will cost roughly the same price, but represents better value for money as he is five years younger.",

      "New Arsenal man Viktor Gyokeres has refused to follow his agent in criticising former club Sporting CP for how they dealt with his summer move. The 27-year-old's Premier League switch was dragged out until last week, with clashes over a gentleman's agreement and a hefty fine issued.",
      "Gyokeres, having established himself as one of Europe's finest goalscorers with 97 in 104 appearances for Sporting, always looked destined to make a big switch this window. He joined the Gunners last weekend for a fee rising to £63.7million, having also been courted by Manchester United, who he chose to snub.",
      "Yet, the deal was not simple, as Gyokeres's Sporting departure was a drawn-out affair. The club refuted a supposed gentleman's agreement allowing the Swede to leave for less than his release clause, and the saga that ensued saw him fined for a training camp absence.",
      "Jonathan Chalkias, who works alongside Gyokeres' agent Hasan Cetinkaya, hit out at Sporting this week, claiming that they showed the striker little respect, but Gyokeres himself has not followed suit.",
      "Speaking to Swedish outlet WTV, Chalkias claimed that former Sporting chief Hugo Viana, who left for Manchester City, would have honoured the much-discussed gentleman's agreement to let his client leave more simply for a lesser sum.",
      "\"It was a mess,\" he began. \"There was a gentleman's agreement with the previous sporting director. If Hugo Viana were still at Sporting, the deal would have been done in an hour. Everything was written, we didn't have time to start a legal battle.",
      "\"I don't understand how a player who scored so many goals and won three trophies didn't deserve more respect. The sacrifices we made were the turning point for the deal to happen.\"",
      "The gentleman's agreement dispute was later followed up with Gyokeres being fined £306,000 – his salary for July – after he refused to report back for pre-season training in an attempt to speed up his departure.",
      "However, Gyokeres, speaking to the same network after his move to Mikel Arteta's side was sealed, insists that he does not need to lash out verbally, grateful that the ordeal is over.",
      "\"I don't need to throw mud at anyone,\" began the Swede, who made his first appearance for the Gunners against bitter rivals Tottenham on Thursday in Hong Kong. \"I don't need to say what others have done or decided.",
      "\"I don't do that, even though there are people who seem to need to tell others how to behave. I'm not like that. As a footballer, you always strive to reach the top. I felt ready to take the next step, and I believe many people at the club expected that before the season ended.",
      "\"I didn't find it strange that this desire came up this summer. I don't think it came from our side either. Besides, my agents work for what's best for my career, so there was some clash of interests, but that's part of football.",
      "\"It's been quite demanding mentally,\" he continued. \"It's been hard, but it also makes us stronger. Of course, I may have questioned it a few times, but I always believed it would happen. So it was that balance over those weeks that made everything quite difficult, but now it's even more enjoyable to be here. I feel very relieved and happy now.\"",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "When Rasmus Hojlund scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester United in December 2023 it bought to an end a wait that had spanned more than 1000 minutes. The relief around Old Trafford was evident.",
      "However no striker signed for more than £70million should have their first strike met with a feeling of relief. Instead there should be a sense of inevitability about them finding back of the net. A feeling of that being a sign of things to come.",
      "Think back to Erling Haaland's brace on his debut for Manchester City at West Ham, for example.",
      "In Hojlund's first season his goals constantly seemed like it was him justifying his price tag and Erik ten Hag's continued show of faith in him. But after scoring in England's top flight it looked as if the Dane was finally up and running.",
      "His strike against Aston Villa began a run of games that saw Hojlund score seven times in six outings. United's investment in the young frontman was done with an acceptance he would grow and develop, he wasn't the finished article. Nearly two years on though and the development simply hasn't been what was anticipated, needed or wanted.",
      "Hojlund, following his purple patch in early 2024, has never again scored in successive games. With each passing game he's looked like a player operating with less and less confidence every time he takes to the pitch. The aura that exists around prime Premier League marksman like Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak simply isn't present in the United No 9.",
      "Ten Hag once said about the 22-year-old: \"He has the resilience and the calmness, and to perform under that stress. He doesn't have any moment that he wants to give up. No, he keeps going every time.\"",
      "That resilience is seriously being tested now. 12 months ago United added Joshua Zirkzee, which was not a glowing endorsement of the club's belief that Hojlund could provide the goals they needed. Again they're in the market for more firepower.",
      "On the face of it, its hard to blame Ruben Amorim, who saw his side scored just 44 times in the league last season. He acknowledged that Hojlund was struggling in the final third, but attributed that to being a team problem, not an individual one.",
      "That said, for all Amorim's defence of his player, the Dane's haul of four league goals was bettered by full-backs like Marc Cucurella and Josko Gvardiol. The question United have to answer is just how long can they wait for Hojlund to ignite, if he is going to at all.",
      "The history of football is littered with players who needed a bit of patience before they became the players they had threatened to be. United's ambitions dictate that they need players, especially those in key positions, to be producing now and Amorim's own grace period is running out.",
      "In recent weeks Ollie Watkins has been cited as a target, now Benjamin Sesko is the man they want with initial talks held. A price tag has been quoted and Amorim has not given any guarantee that Hojlund will be a United player beyond the summer, stating \"I don't know what is going to happen.\"",
      "The Dane himself though is determined to fight for his place and prove his worth, welcoming the addition of a new striker to compete with even if that is likely to see him fall down the pecking order.",
      "Man Utd appearances - 95",
      "Premier League goals - 14",
      "European goals - 11",
      "FA Cup / Carabao Cup goals - 1",
      "He said: “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "If a week is a long time in football then 18 months is a few lifetimes. In February 2024 United saw off West Ham 3-0 at Old Trafford, a game in which Hojlund was on target. But it was the celebration that followed Alejandro Garnacho's goal that had those in Manchester purring.",
      "The Argentine reeled away and sat himself on the advertising board. Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo wandered over and followed suit with the image of the trio - all young, thriving and seemingly with their best days ahead of them - appearing to give a snapshot into the future of the club.",
      "Today, Garnacho is up for sale having angered numerous senior figures in Manchester. Mainoo has been linked with a lucrative move away as Amorim said he is \"so good sometimes but he can be better.\" And Hojlund is now seemingly fighting for his future.",
      "The message may well be, seize your moment, or watch it pass you by.",

      "Ruben Amorim's decision to include youngster Ethan Williams in Manchester United's squad for their pre-season tour of the US seems to have paid off. The 19-year-old was not expected to be part of the travelling cohort, but scored against Bournemouth on Thursday.",
      "The Red Devils made it two wins from two in the Premier League Summer Series when they beat the Cherries 4-1 in Chicago, having already put West Ham to the sword on Sunday. Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring after eight minutes, with Patrick Dorgu adding another before half-time.",
      "Amad Diallo netted their third on 53 minutes, and just one minute after coming on in place of the Ivorian, Williams swept home after a brilliant run from Diego Leon.",
      "Williams was not initially expected to travel to the US in light of an anticipated loan move, yet Amorim is now reaping the rewards after he reversed this decision, having taken a real shine to the English talent.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Williams, who scored twice during the second half of last season on loan at Cheltenham Town, was expected to be excluded from United's pre-season tour.",
      "This decision was reportedly made as a plethora of League One clubs were interested in taking Williams on loan. However, head coach Amorim changed his mind late on after taking a liking to the wideman.",
      "\"It was last minute,\" Williams told the club's website after Thursday's victory. \"I was kind of told I wasn't [going] and then I was. I remember just not jumping around the bedroom, but I was buzzing.",
      "\"I've been trying to train well as these guys are the best players I've ever trained with, know what I mean? To be around it and be learning every single day is a real blessing and I'm just thankful for it all.\"",
      "Williams failed to see gametime in the Red Devils' 2-1 victory over West Ham in New Jersey at the weekend, but made an immediate impact at Soldier Field and cut an exuberant figure post-match.",
      "\"It's mad, I can't believe it,\" he declared. \"It still hasn't really sunk in, to be honest. It's a dream come true and I'm so happy right now. I'm thinking about all the moments, all the hard work I've been through.",
      "\"You know, I feel so blessed and so happy to be given this opportunity. To score, it's mad. I can't even explain how I am feeling, to be honest. I already messaged my dad. He put in so much hard work, he's sacrificed everything for me and my little brother to do this.",
      "\"I was straight on the phone, messaging him, [saying] I can't believe I just scored. He was like: 'I told you.' Because we were kind of manifesting it for some time now. For me to finally take this experience, and actually go ahead with it and score, it's a crazy feeling.\"",
      "While it is still likely that Williams will be shipped out on loan after pre-season concludes, Amorim may have been given something to think about with this cameo, especially considering the winger's following admission.",
      "\"Obviously, I want to stay here and, obviously, my long-term goal is to play for the first team,\" added 19-year-old Williams. \"It'd be a dream.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag's attempts to introduce wholesale changes at Bayer Leverkusen look as though they will have to wait. The former Manchester United boss has taken over from Xabi Alonso at the BayArena, but an instant tactical shift has proved difficult.",
      "Leverkusen won the Bundesliga in 2024 with Alonso's three-at-the-back approach reaping rewards. Ten Hag's preference throughout his career has been for a back four - an approach which helped him reach the Champions League semi-finals with Ajax and win two domestic cups with United - but things are proving trickier in Germany.",
      "It hasn't helped that Ten Hag has been forced to rebuild after the loss of some key players. Jeremie Frimpong and Jonathan Tah were the first to seal moves away, with Florian Wirtz and Granit Xhaka since following suit.",
      "After a humbling defeat to a Flamengo Under-20 side in his first pre-season game, Ten Hag oversaw a victory over Bochum on Sunday. With the new season drawing closer, though, a return to an Alonso-style back three appears inevitable.",
      "Sporting director Simon Rolfes has said he held conversations with Ten Hag over the tweak, telling Bild: \"I believe it's a good system, that we have great stability in it and that we have the players for it. It makes sense to put many of the players on the pitch.\"",
      "Swiss midfielder Xhaka, one of Alonso's important signings ahead of the 2023-24 title campaign, has returned to the Premier League with Sunderland. \"I'm very proud to be here. When I spoke to the club, I was excited and I felt the energy, and the mentality that all the people and players have,\" the former Arsenal star said.",
      "\"It's exactly what I wanted, and I have a very good feeling. We are back to where this club needs to be, and we want to stay here to write our own history. I feel that I'm ready to help the team with my experience but with quality as well.\"",
      "Ten Hag has brought in a number of new faces, including former Premier League stars Jarell Quansah and Mark Flekken. Quansah made his debut in the weekend win over Bochum, as did fellow new arrivals Ibrahim Maza and Christian Kofane.",
      "Leverkusen have also spent £30m on Malik Tillman, with the United States international joining from PSV Eindhoven. \"This club has always played great football. But in the last four or five years Leverkusen have grown enormously and become attractive to a lot of players throughout Europe,\" the former Rangers loanee said.",

      "The reaction from a Manchester United staff member was one of near incredulity at Patrick Dorgu's performance in Chicago.",
      "\"Proficient\" was the word the suit used to describe Dorgu's start at the club. Dorgu, a left back by trade, is developing into a pure winger on the evidence of pre-season.",
      "Those selected for the wide roles in United's 3-4-2-1 system are routinely referred to as \"wing-backs\" when they have to be viewed as wingers. They are picked to service the striker. Dorgu did just that for Rasmus Hojlund's first goal against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We have a very good relationship,\" Hojlund said in the Soldier Field mixed zone. \"There's only one year between us and we have a lot of common friends. We come from the same sort of area in Denmark as well and we're really starting to bond.\"",
      "Dorgu also got on the scoresheet for the first time in United colours. The 20-year-old is more attack-minded and more intense than he was during his sheepish first few months, admittedly in a team that literally could not string two Premier League wins together.",
      "\"I feel like I play the same way,\" Dorgu opined. \"I just came in at a difficult moment and I think the team is improving a lot through the pre-season. I think it's more like a collective than an individual.",
      "\"I feel like we need to attack more and I feel like me and Amad did well today to be attacking and always be a threat in behind.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim struggled to find the right balance with the United team in his first six months. He often picked eight defensive players, hardly in keeping with the club's ethos.",
      "The indecision was apparent in the days leading up to the Europa League final when Bruno Fernandes was suddenly moved back to midfield to accommodate Mason Mount, a decision that hammered the final nail in Alejandro Garnacho's coffin.",
      "Now the defenders are going on the attack. In the absence of Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro is embracing the line-breaking role from centre back, spraying the odd pass from his own third into the opponent's.",
      "Fernandes was urgent in central midfield against Bournemouth, Dorgu was more of an attacker than a defender and Hojlund was ably supported by Amad and Mason Mount. It is a better balance.",
      "United have not put on a full open training session, as they have done on previous tours, due to the sheer amount of tactical work Amorim has presided over. Club media's lenses have not even been permitted entry for those sensitive segments. The players are playing as if they are being coached to within an inch of their lives.",
      "Jose Mourinho privately observed that Amorim's system revolves around \"providing depth to the striker\". United are more direct and pinging more forward passes towards Hojlund, not as isolated in possession.",
      "\"I'm not going to say every training session, but he (Amorim) makes sure that you go prepared for every game,\" Diogo Dalot said. \"We go to every game already knowing what's going to happen, more or less, with the opposition.",
      "\"Obviously, it can happen that they might change something, but the basics of every team, we try to go to every game prepared. We always do the walk-throughs and some tactical work, of course. He's very keen on that so we can be prepared.",
      "\"But at the same time, the message is really clear. There's not too much information, so everybody knows two or three things they need to do during the game.",
      "\"Once we get used to that, I think we will reach a point, hopefully, where we can almost play with our eyes closed. We already know where everybody is going to be on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim personally oversees the tactical walk-throughs. Unlike the dogmatic Louis van Gaal, who infamously admonished a player if he took a shot without first controlling the ball, Amorim trusts the players to make their own decisions in a match environment. His assistant, Carlos Fernandes, continues to take charge of set pieces and certain drills.",
      "The United head coach has settled on a softer form of discipline than Erik ten Hag. Players have breakfast in the Waldorf Astoria from 7.30am and have to be on the coach to training at the Endeavor Health Performance Center by 9.15. There is gym work before the players head onto the grass at 10.30. Amorim usually hits the gym for an hour from 7am each morning.",
      "Ten Hag's dim view of tardy timekeeping caused congestion on the stairwell in United's Bangkok hotel during his first tour in 2022. The lifts in the Athenee hotel were so slow that players sometimes trekked up 40 flights of stairs to make meals on time.",
      "United have performed enterprisingly in their two tour games in New Jersey and Chicago. Their chance-conversion rate in the latter against Bournemouth was most unlike them: four goals from six attempts on target. Most pleasingly for Amorim, United won without either of their £133.5million signings in the squad at Soldier Field.",
      "The team look in sync after a chastening six months getting to grips with Amorim's formation. He has identified the most suitable position for certain players, such as placing Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt in the middle of the back three. A minor adjustment but one that has emboldened Yoro and, to a lesser extent, Ayden Heaven on the left.",
      "Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have not started together, so the outfield is not overloaded with defensive-minded starters. United were initially rigid in the 3-4-2-1 and now look fluid, with Amad and Kobbie Mainoo seamlessly shifting between different roles in the two tour games.",
      "\"More than the results, it's the way they are playing,\" Amorim replied when asked if there was a difference about United. \"I think it's really important. People cannot see that. I think they are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other. Not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"I think they are stronger, they are faster. In this moment, of course, it's a pre-season. But you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"So we are improving. But again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season. It's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game. I think today was a good day.\"",
      "What we can see is this is the fittest United have looked on tour for several years. There was gallows humour in the press box that Matheus Cunha, who spent more time walking than any other outfield player in the Premier League last season, sat out the Bournemouth win due to fatigue. Amorim warned the players at the start of his tenure that they would have to \"run like dogs\".",
      "\"I think we will hopefully see a United team that is attacking more, that's on the front foot,\" Dorgu added, \"that's trying to dominate games, every game. We just take the rest of the pre-season to get even better.",
      "\"I feel like we're getting there, we're playing more as a team, we're running for each other, we just need to fight to win games, we need everyone to play 100 per cent and that's what we're trying to do.",
      "\"You can see it on the pitch that we're playing [as] a more active team. With the press, we run more for each other, so you can see that the pre-season has helped everyone.\"",
      "Mount revealed at the start of the tour that players were kicking each other more in training to up the intensity. The keep-ball activities at the start of sessions are usually lighthearted looseners. Fernandes was borderline overzealous on Tuesday, flying into Cunha.",
      "Well-placed sources have noticed how pleased the players are that Fernandes has stayed. Amorim quickly came to lean on him last season and his influence is so profound that Amorim regards Fernandes as the Mourinho to his Bobby Robson.",
      "Fernandes and Harry Maguire are the two players who spend the most time with the football staff. Fernandes joined club employees at the W Hotel bar on the post-season tour in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "The last time the majority of United's starters played for more than an hour in an opening tour game was in 2018 in Phoenix when Mourinho had to pick a shadow squad a week after the World Cup concluded. Lee Grant was his most senior available goalkeeper and Antonio Valencia, the captain, lasted a half against Club America. Nine days later, Mourinho accused Valencia of enjoying \"too much holiday\" in the close season.",
      "The current United players were all given an individual programme for the close season. Sources say much of it was a specific running drill that the players were tasked with replicating regularly back at the club's Carrington training complex, not dissimilar to a bleep test. The sports scientists have been impressed with the results, proof the players treated the programmes seriously, and the feeling is it has allowed United to hit the ground running in pre-season.",
      "Amorim has eschewed double sessions that have been commonplace on past United tours. From one o'clock onwards, the players are free to do as they please, with a midnight curfew set for them and staff.",
      "United have been based at the Chicago Fire's immaculate training complex that opened this year. United favour a base for their pre-season schedule and the delayed flight to New Jersey for the West Ham match was a minor matter owed to the stormy weather.",
      "Crucially, Amorim ensured United did not schlep across to San Diego to play at the Snapdragon Stadium to keep the sponsors sweet. That would have meant United heading west, where the time zone difference is eight hours as opposed to six in Chicago.",
      "Staff felt the schedule for the 2023 tour - New Jersey, San Diego, in and out of Houston and Las Vegas - affected United's form at the start of a sulphurous season. United seem to be the only football club that has to reiterate that football comes first but on this tour it has.",
      "They have been better than proficient.",

      "Diogo Dalot has backed Ruben Amorim's handling of Manchester United's wantaways.",
      "Amorim refused to allow the 'bomb squad' members, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, to train with the United first team amid their wish to leave the club.",
      "Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but the other four players are still at the club, training back in Manchester while the first team is on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "Amorim dropped Rashford and Garnacho from the squad for the Manchester derby in December and he sanctioned the mid-season loans of Antony and Malacia to Real Betis and PSV Eindhoven. Sancho has not made a competitive appearance for United since August 2023 and does not have a squad number.",
      "The United head coach has stressed that he is only interested in coaching players who want to be at the club and Dalot feels that Amorim's approach has benefited the squad in the States.",
      "\"I think he's really good as a manager of trying to [get] the best out of you,\" Dalot said. \"He's very clear in his messages that you want to be a part of the team or you cannot be here. If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you're not able to match it, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.",
      "\"The message was that if you started the pre-season, it's because he believes that we are the group that needs to come. Obviously, we had players coming in, which is always amazing. You can feel straight away that they match those standards.",
      "\"We are really happy with how things are going, but we're not going to get carried away by the results of what we are doing. It just has to give you motivation that when you do things right, you get the results.\"",
      "Dalot suggested the strong \"connection\" between the players has underpinned the harmony in United's happy camp. \"I think we are now creating a group that fights for each other. I think that's what we are trying to create.",
      "\"Obviously, there's still a long way to go. I'm not going to say perfect because it's difficult, but that's where we want to go, towards perfection.",
      "\"But obviously, I think you can see straight away some signs of the team fighting a bit more, having more intensity, and that's what we are trying to do.\"",
      "Dalot's club and international teammate, Bruno Fernandes, rejected the chance to leave United for the Saudi Pro League at the start of the summer. Fernandes signed a new three-year contract with United in August 2024 following interest from Bayern Munich and Inter Milan and he went on to claim a fourth Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "However, United endured their worst campaign for 51 years and Al Hilal made a proposal to Fernandes, who ultimately opted to stay at United.",
      "\"I think it's a clear message that he still believes that this club can go to the places that it should be,\" Dalot added. \"I don't think there's a better way of starting a season than your captain staying and believing that this can go in the right direction. It's a clear message for the other teammates, for everybody, that we have to believe.",
      "\"We have to work really hard to put Manchester back on the place that it deserves.\"",
      "Patrick Dorgu played on the opposite flank to Dalot in the 4-1 win against Bournemouth in Chicago and was named the man of the match after he assisted Rasmus Hojlund's opening goal and scored the eventual winner.",
      "Dorgu joined United from Lecce in a £29million deal in the winter transfer window and played regularly on the left wing but did not tally a competitive goal or assist for his new club.",
      "The 20-year-old has shone during United's pre-season and been more attack-minded. Dorgu revealed that United are becoming a \"more active\" side.",
      "\"You can see it on the pitch that we're playing a more active team,\" he explained. \"With the press we run more for each other, so you can see that the pre-season has helped everyone.",
      "\"I think we will hopefully see a United team that is attacking more, that's on the front foot, that's trying to dominate games, every game. We just take the rest of the pre-season to get even better.\"",

      "The 27-year-old has done some individual ball work and running outdoors at the Endeavor Health Performance Center in Chicago but is not ready to re-join team training.",
      "Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee are also training on the grass again in their recovery from injuries. A well-placed source said Onana, who suffered a hamstring strain in training last month, has been \"throwing himself around\" in training but in non-contact drills.",
      "Onana could make his return in United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9, eight days before their first Premier League fixture at home to Arsenal.",
      "United have been in the market for a new goalkeeper and had a loan offer for Emiliano Martinez rejected by Aston Villa earlier this summer.",
      "Zirkzee sustained a minor injury at the start of pre-season and was not able to play in United's games against Leeds United, West Ham United and Bournemouth.",
      "The 24-year-old was rushed back from a hamstring injury to come on in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao but Zirkzee sustained a different injury two weeks ago.",
      "\"I’ve got a small injury but it shouldn’t take too long to recover now,\" Zirkzee said in midweek. \"I’ve got great physios working with me every day.",
      "\"It’s not a serious problem. It’s pre-season so unlike last season where I wanted to push myself to be back for the final, obviously now I just want to be there for the start of the season.\"",

      "Few players impressed in Manchester United colours towards the end of last season more than Leny Yoro.",
      "The centre-back, who arrived from Lille in July last year, went from strength-to-strength in the second half of the campaign and it was not long before United fans were drooling over his potential.",
      "When it was confirmed he had made the starting XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, it gave United a shot in the arm ahead of kick-off. Unfortunately, his presence at the back did not improve their attacking efforts.",
      "Yoro experienced a stop-start debut campaign at Old Trafford because of injury issues. He did not make his competitive debut for the club until December after fracturing his metatarsal in the opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States last July.",
      "Just over a year after his premature exit against Arsenal in Los Angeles, Yoro is reminding United's stateside supporters of what they missed out on last summer.",
      "After starting United's goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm on the bench, he has started the opening two games in the US, helping United beat West Ham United (2-1) and most recently Bournemouth (4-1). He has occupied the right-sided centre-back spot on both occasions.",
      "Plenty of caveats have to be taken into account when making judgements on pre-season friendlies, but there is no doubt United have been sharp and enjoyable to watch. They have played with an excellent tempo and plenty of purpose.",
      "There is also no doubt they are benefitting from their first pre-season under head coach Ruben Amorim, who arrived at Old Trafford last November and immediately switched to a three-at-the-back formation. The team has been balanced and everyone understands their roles.",
      "Keen to build through the thirds, there is plenty of expectation on the shoulders of United's centre-backs, particularly those who occupy the two wide berths. Yoro and Ayden Heaven started in those positions against West Ham and Luke Shaw came in to replace the latter for the win over Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "After playing a couple of really eye-catching cross-field passes during the win over West Ham, helping United get on the front foot and up the pitch in next to no time, Yoro was similarly attack-minded against the Cherries, showing an eagerness to get on the ball and drive up the pitch.",
      "Yoro is very comfortable on the ball and his desire to get up the pitch when in possession cannot be faulted. Amorim wants ball-plying defenders in his ranks and Yoro fits the bill, likewise Heaven.",
      "The Frenchman, who can operate on either the right or the left of the back-three, demonstrating last season that he is comfortable on his unnatural side, is highlighting he wants to become an aggressive centre-back that can get on the ball and advance. And that is something he has already set himself as a personal goal for the coming season.",
      "\"Maybe I would say sometimes the aggressiveness,\" he told Rising Ballers earlier this summer. \"I think I can be more aggressive because with the ball, I need to improve, of course, but I think I'm good [when in possession].\"",
      "Yoro's assertiveness on the ball was particularly noticeable against Bournemouth. He wanted to get the ball played into his feet and advance, regularly crossing the halfway line to occupy attacking positions.",
      "As already documented, caveats have to be accounted for in pre-season, and the time and space Bournemouth afforded United at Soldier Field is unlikely to be the same once the competitive action starts later this month.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",
      "Also full fixtures guide so you don't miss a game in what is set to be a thrilling season.",
      "Get your copy NOW",
      "Nevertheless, Yoro's performance was another one that offered plenty of encouragement and confidence. His showings towards the end of last season offered plenty of evidence to suggest United have a player with an extremely bright future on their hands.",
      "His opening two performances in the US have certainly backed up that theory and there is undoubtedly more to come from him. If he can avoid any injury issues this season, he will be an ever-present figure for Amorim.",

      "Those of you who decided to stay up overnight may well be feeling tired but shall be delighted with what you witnessed in Chicago. United continued their unbeaten start to pre-season with an exceptional 4-1 victory against AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring, before Patrick Dorgu, Amad and youngster Ethan Williams added gloss to the scoreline. The only blotch on the performance was an own goal from Matthijs de Ligt but it would do little to dampen the enthusiasm for that display.",
      "Away from pre-season, United's main focus is now a move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. The Reds are advancing their approach for the Slovenian after discovering that the pursuit of Ollie Watkins was unlikely to be fruitful.",

      "United postponed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season training last month and removed him from his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he has now secured his dream move to Barcelona after spending the latter part of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",

      "He told TBR Football: \"Rasmus Hojlund knows he is not wanted by Man United as first choice, he knows they have been talking to strikers all summer – let’s not forget they were trying for Liam Delap in early July. Now it is Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"United have not directly told him he can leave, and vice-versa, Hojlund has not demanded to leave – but I am told they have talked and he knows where he stands. If Sesko or another new number nine arrives, Hojlund is likely to leave.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim revealed he is happy with his new squad following a busy summer transfer window.",
      "He said after Manchester United's 4-1 victory over Bournemouth last night: \"It's just pre-season, but the feeling with the same players, if I look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team. And that is a good sign.",

      "It is easy to understand why some Manchester United supporters have reservations about the club's pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",

      "United are keen to offload the winger this summer as they aim to bolster their attacking line-up. It is thought that the ex-Borussia Dortmund player doesn't feature in United boss Ruben Amorim's long-term plans and is likely to depart from M16 once more.",

      "Marcus Rashford is settling into life at Barcelona after completing his loan move to the Catalan giants from Manchester United this summer.",
      "The La Liga champions will be covering Rashford's salary during his time at Camp Nou, a move that is projected to save United approximately £12million. Barcelona also hold the option to make his transfer to Catalonia a permanent one for £26m.",
      "United postponed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season training last month and removed him from his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he has now secured his dream move to Barcelona after spending the latter part of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Below is a round-up of what those connected with Barcelona have said about Rashford's move to the Camp Nou so far.",
      "Striker Robert Lewandowski become the first Barcelona player to publicly express his feelings about Rashford's move to the club.",
      "\"We played Manchester United two years ago and he was in great form. He can help us and is able to play in different positions.\"",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick felt that Rashford did what every other player did by putting in a solid shift against FC Seoul in the club's recent pre-season friendly, as the United loanee bagged his first assist for his new club.",
      "\"Each player had 45 minutes,\" he said, via the Metro. \"In the end, I’m happy.",
      "\"We had a good start in the first half and then we were a little sluggish, but we returned to a great level. In the second half, too, with Gavi, Ferran, Marcus… also Gerard Martin in a position that isn’t his usual one.\"",
      "It follows on from the Barcelona coach explaining why Rashford only played 33 minutes on his debut against Vissel Kobe. Speaking after the game, he said: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball.\"",
      "Jules Kounde has already noticed that Rashford is slightly more reserved than other players in the dressing room.",
      "\"He's a bit introverted, but he's really enjoying himself, and feeling more and more comfortable,\" Kounde said of Rashford to Diario Sport. \"I think he is happy. He is smiling a lot. He is happy in the field.",
      "\"He reminds me a little of myself. He's a bit introverted, but he's enjoying himself a lot, and I think he's feeling more and more comfortable. Everyone has welcomed him very warmly. He's talking to everyone.",
      "\"I think he's very comfortable. As I speak English, I'm trying to help him as best I can, but I think everyone is doing that.\"",
      "Barcelona midfielder Gavi was quizzed about the club's failed pursuit of Athletic Club's Nico Williams, but decided to focus on how happy he is at Rashford's arrival.",
      "Asked by AS, he said: \"Everyone knows Nico is a very good player. He's always proven that with the national team. I'm happy with Marcus's arrival because he's an impressive player. We're very happy with his signing.\"",
      "Barcelona legend Rivaldo has insisted that Rashford is unlikely to start ahead of Raphinha, who scored a staggering 34 goals under Hansi Flick last term.",
      "\"I think that’s highly unlikely that Rashford will take Raphinha’s spot, especially after the season Raphinha had last year. In my view, Raphinha is currently among the top five players in the world,\" he told Betfair.",
      "\"Right now, he’s an undisputed starter at Barça and already a club icon. Everyone, the players, the coaching staff, the whole club rates him very highly.",
      "\"What he did last season was outstanding, so without a doubt, that position is his. Of course, it’s always good to have top-quality players around you. So yes, there will be competition, but I don’t think Rashford is going to take Raphinha’s place.",
      "\"Other opportunities will arise, and with training, the manager will likely find a way to fit them both into the team. But for me, Raphinha is a nailed-on starter. I don’t see any chance of him being dropped from Barça’s starting line-up.\"",

      "Despite having seen Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Enzo Kana-Biyik all arrive at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim is still actively searching for further reinforcements.",
      "United still want to bring in a goalkeeper, a midfielder and a new centre forward, according to The Independent, and look to be advancing with a move for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But in terms of outgoings, four players have been told they have no future under Amorim and are still on the search for a new club.",
      "Below, MEN Sport looks at the names who could still leave United before the end of the window and the latest rumours surrounding their futures.",
      "Altay Bayindir, despite going on United's pre-season tour, is desperate for more first-team football. He has seen his opportunities limited since joining from Fenerbahce in 2023.",
      "For now, no concrete offers have arrived for the Turkey international, with some murmurings that a move back to his homeland could be on the cards.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Bayindir stays at United this season, and his exit would likely affect whether a new shot-stopper arrives at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is proving a hard sell, especially given his injury problems over the last two years. In fact, he almost feels like a forgotten man.",
      "Malacia isn't part of Amorim's plans, and the Netherlands international has been told to find a new club. Having spent time with PSV Eindhoven on loan last season, the Dutch giants appear not so keen on a permanent deal.",
      "Another loan move could be the play for Malacia, but it's been a torrid time at United since his arrival under Erik ten Hag, and a fresh start should stand him in good stead to revive his career.",
      "Antony looks to be the biggest sellable asset for United as we reach August, which is a surprise given his form over the last six months.",
      "Having enjoyed a superb loan spell at Real Betis, rumours have suggested a return to Spain is still on the cards, with interest from Saudi Arabia having also arisen.",
      "Antony's transfer fee was always going to attract criticism, but he has proven his worth at both Ajax and Betis, even if his skillset appears less suited to English football.",
      "Despite a decent enough loan spell at Chelsea, Jadon Sancho is still a Manchester United player, and his wages are proving tricky to shift.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund man earns an estimated £300,000-a-week at Old Trafford, and plenty of clubs have already decided he is not worth the outlay alone.",
      "In a situation similar to many former United stars, Antony Martial and Victor Lindelof also decided to run down their healthy contracts, and Sancho could be the next one. Italian and Saudi Arabian interest appears to have gone cold.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is another player who has been bombed out by Amorim, with interest from Chelsea and Arsenal having been mooted this summer.",
      "Aston Villa is also another potential location, with Garnacho keen to stay in the Premier League, given his young family's wishes.",
      "United want a fee close to £40m for the young Argentine, and his exit seems one that INEOS are confident about, given rumours all summer long.",
      "The curious case of Rasmus Hojlund continues, especially given his showing in pre-season against Bournemouth in the US this week.",
      "Having opened the scoring for United, Hojlund wants to stay at Old Trafford, but Amorim may be forced into a sale if talks for Sesko continue and funds are needed.",
      "A move to Inter had been talked up, but the Serie A giants have now signed former Parma man Yoan-Ange Bonny and that move seems to be dead in the water.",

      "Sesko's stock has been on the rise over the last few years and United expressed interest in him back in 2022. He moved from Red Bull Salzburg to Leipzig in the summer 2023 after the two clubs reached an agreement 12 months earlier.",

      "The 27-year-old made his second appearance for the La Liga champions at the Seoul World Cup Stadium in South Korea on Thursday afternoon as goals from Robert Lewandowski, Andreas Christensen, Ferran Torres, and Gavi secured a resounding 7-3 triumph for Hansi Flick's side.",
      "The England international, who joined Barcelona on loan from Manchester United earlier this month, provided an assist for Gavi after he was introduced to the action at the start of the second half.",
      "However, there was an equally special moment for Rashford after the game as he was reunited with former United team-mate and close friend Jesse Lingard, who has played for FC Seoul since leaving the Premier League in 2023.",

      "Posting to Instagram after the game, Lingard revealed that he had swapped shirts with both Rashford and Yamal.",
      "Clearly, Rashford enjoyed the reunion with Lingard as he reposted the story to his own Instagram account with emojis included.",
      "He will be hoping to revitalise his career in Catalonia having fallen out of favour with Reds head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"The situation with Manchester United is that the club is going through a period of change, and this has been ongoing for some time,\" Rashford said of his parent club. \"I don’t have anything negative to say about Manchester United.\"",

The former Aston Villa star faces an uncertain future in Turin with reports suggesting that he could return to the Premier League after leaving for Serie A last summer.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, the 27-year-old will leave the Italian giants this summer, which has sparked fresh speculation surrounding his future. In other outlets, United have been mooted as possible suitors to add reinforcements to their midfield after adding Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to their attacking firepower.",
      "Football Insider claimed in mid-July that United had registered their interest in the Juventus midfielder.",
      "It was reported at the time that they faced competition from Everton who were also reportedly targeting Luiz, despite four years remaining on his contract.",
      "The claims suggest that it comes after the Serie A side began considering their options and were keen to offload the midfielder, preferring permanent offers over a short-term solution.",
      "Speaking to reporters, Comolli claimed that Luiz was forced to apologise after disrespecting his teammates.",

      "As reported by the Telegraph, Chelsea maintain their interest in the United winger this summer, and is said to be the favoured destination for the player this window. The Blues are said to have made background checks on Garnacho, and hold no concerns over his character after being bombed out of the United squad by head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "It is added that Chelsea are expected to make an offer for the winger, but may wait until United’s search for a new striker is over.",
      "The Blues themselves may need to create space in their squad with the sale and loan of attackers. Christopher Nkunku and Armando Broja are expected to leave permanently, while Marc Guiu and Tyrique George could complete loan moves.",
      "Chelsea are also said to have held talks with Red Bull Leipzig over a deal for Xavi Simons, but even if he does arrive at Stamford Bridge, it would not stop a move for Garnacho happening if enough room could be made in the squad.",

      "Although even writing that sentence has made us realise it should have been a silver kit, shouldn’t it? The FA Cup is not goldware. There’s more than one reason why tinfoil and not gold leaf is the preferred method for covering your cardboard FA Cup when your local non-league team reaches the first round for the first time.",
      "The ‘Korean-style’ collar also looks a bit odd. We’re going to have our cake and eat it here; despite our frequent complaints about the modern trend for plain boring crew-neck collars on football shirts, there are still times when they are a solid and appropriate choice, and one of those is when you’ve already made the rest of the kit ostentatiously showy gold.

And if anything even more so here where the use of black seems to lean even harder into traditional United areas.",
      "We do rather like that shield for the badge, though. And again, the shirt is absolutely rock solid. We just can’t quite work out why adidas have decided to mix two of what is now their Premier League ‘Big Three’ kits that appear better suited to the other.

      "We like the black. We like the collar. We can happily live with the silver Puma cat and Etihad logos. But that full silver City badge is just too much. Rendering the badge in the colours of an away kit is almost always a good choice and we can see why it was felt necessary here, but it just doesn’t quite work. And on what is otherwise such a simple kit there’s really nowhere else to look which just makes it stand out more.",

      "The home kit is the home kit, that’s rarely going to be the one. And definitely isn’t for West Ham this season, because that home kit is very strong. The navy and gold third kit also has plenty to grab the attention.",

We don’t hate metallic or neon detailing on a black shirt, but there’s something to be said for leaning into the monochrome simplicity, and Nike have done that beautifully here.",

The light blue pinstripes pop beautifully between the stripes/panels/whatever, and the elegance with which the umbro mark and Bournemouth badge sit within the two blue stripes is just very lovely indeed.",
      "And while we’re on the subject: just look at that badge. We are suckers for a club crest re-rendered in the appropriate colourway for an away kit and this is just an absolutely fabulous example of it. More excellent use here of that lighter blue that really pulls the whole kit together.",

The vibrant yellow and navy is a classic Tottenham change kit colourway, the Total 90 template remains sensational even if we do find the very idea that anything from a year beginning with a ‘2’ might now be considered fair game for raking in the retro-nostalgia coin slightly uncomfortable.",

      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: if you must deploy a central club crest, you simply must also centralise the maker’s mark. It’s a basic question of balance. This example of this unacceptably frequent misstep upsets more than most, given the otherwise 10/10 shirt they’ve decided to slightly spoil for simply no good reason.",

      "We like this one a lot, especially for the clever use of the ‘snowflake’ imprint. It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",
      "But if it works, it works. And what they’ve done for United here that maybe isn’t quite so true of the (nevertheless strikingly excellent) Arsenal away kit is do something new and different with it. In this case that means making it all massive.",

Very bold, and it turns out very correct. Because this is excellent. Lovely shield on there, as in the 93-95 umbro kit to which this doesn’t so much subtly nod as hold up great big neon arrows with flashing signs on them saying “Remember when Eric sorted out that wrong’un lol”.",

      "It is so, so much better than last year’s away kit when, instead of drawing inspiration from a beloved Arsenal kit from the past a rare yet gigantic mis-step from the Germans saw them instead influenced by a bottle of Lynx Africa.",
      "The only minor grumble one could reasonably have here is the similarity to a third kit Arsenal had a few years ago, and thus the fact that this shirt could be argued to represent the running out of ideas, with adidas leaning on the lightning bolt motif yet again on yet another retro-inspired Arsenal shirt.",
      "To this we say: Yeah, whatever, just look at it. It is lovely. And that’s the real quiz.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "13) Victor Osimhen – £64.8m/€75m (Napoli to Galatasaray, July 2025)\nA decent haul of 37 goals and eight assists in 41 games on loan inspired Galatasaray to a league and cup double while convincing them Osimhen was entirely worth absolutely obliterating a Turkish transfer record which had previously stood at around €20m.",
      "",
      "14) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "15) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "16) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "17) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "18) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "19) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "20) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle. To make matters worse, Eto’o won the Treble with Inter.",

      "These five English youngsters are set to move clubs this summer. But where are they going? Well, we’ve tried to predict that, with Tottenham Hotspur snapping up two starlets…",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\n“I don’t really want to be wasting years on my career because it’s a short career. I just want to improve and be the best possible version of myself. If that’s to go somewhere else, then it’s a decision that I’m going to have to make.”",
      "That’s Liverpool attacking midfielder Harvey Elliott earlier this summer. The club’s signing of Florian Wirtz does the 22-year-old no favours, while Hugo Ekitike is another signing to contend with out wide. Luis Diaz has left, but then Alexander Isak is coming in. The writing is on the wall for the Under-21 European Championship’s Player of the Tournament.",
      "We are well over a month on from the acceptance that Elliott will leave Anfield this summer, yet there has been a concerning lack of movement. He was a big name at the start of the window but it’s gone pretty quiet. We said he’d be ‘perfect’ for Manchester United, but there’s no chance that happens. Then you have West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur. The London clubs are being linked more than others, while Newcastle United – who have more alarming priorities – are in the picture.",
      "After missing out on Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White, Tottenham should go all in on Elliott. They need a creative spark in midfield, and more depth in the middle of the park in general. The Liverpool youngster has the versatility to play in a midfield three, behind the striker, or on either wing. Thomas Frank has plenty of depth in wide areas, but James Maddison’s injury record is concerning, and Dejan Kulusevski – who’s also struggled with injuries this year – is naturally a winger.",
      "So, yes, a transfer to Spurs makes sense. Not just for the club, but for Elliott. If he moves there, he’ll still have Champions League football and a platform to become an England regular. Competition for places in Thomas Frank’s midfield is fierce, but from what Elliott has shown us, we’re confident that he’s good enough.",

      "",
      "James McAtee (Manchester City)\nReports suggest that Man City want Cole Palmer money for James McAtee. Considering they massively underpriced the former, we can’t blame them. Now worth over £100million on Transfermarkt and surely not available for anything below £180m, Palmer joined Chelsea for around £40m in September 2023.",
      "Palmer played 41 times (12 starts) for the Cityzens, scoring six and assisting two. Nobody could foresee what the 23-year-old would become at Chelsea, which means it’s unfair to completely disregard McAtee – 34 appearances and seven goals for City – as capable of reaching a similar level. They are both young, English attacking midfielders, who will leave having been unable to repeat Phil Foden’s success. It’s hardly an easy task considering how much City invest on players.",
      "While it’s unfair to disregard McAtee as a potential Palmer, it’s difficult to envision him moving to a ‘Big Six’ rival, besides Spurs, who, as we’ve said, want to bring in a creative midfielder. Aston Villa could be a good fit if Morgan Rogers or Jacob Ramsey leaves, but they are clearly working with a very limited budget and won’t be spending £40m on McAtee.",
      "We really like the Bundesliga links, and as things stand, a move to Germany seems the most likely. Borussia Dortmund are being linked but recently signed Jobe Bellingham and are now looking for a more natural wide player after selling Jamie Gittens to Chelsea. Then you have long-time admirers Bayer Leverkusen, on top of Stuttgart and Eintracht Frankfurt. Stuttgart finished ninth last season, making them the only club on that list not in the Champions League.",
      "The Bundesliga has proven to be an incredible springboard for English talent and McAtee surely knows that. Leverkusen are a good fit and say what you like about Erik ten Hag, he’s done some excellent work with young players in his managerial career.",
      "",
      "Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea)\nThere’s no shame in failing at Chelsea. Especially as a young player. They sign so many players that it’s difficult to keep up. Plenty of promising youngsters will be regretting choosing the Stamford Bridge project, and Chukwuemeka is one of them.",
      "There was strong competition for the midfielder’s signature when it became clear he’d leave Aston Villa for around £15m in the 2022 summer transfer window. Every top club, and Manchester United, wanted him, but it was Chelsea that won the race and since then, the 21-year-old has scored twice in 32 matches for the Londoners, starting a bleak five times.",
      "Chukwuemeka, like McAtee, seems destined for a move abroad. He’s already had a taste, spending the second half of last season on loan at Dortmund. He scored on his only Bundesliga start and was only an unused substitute twice during his time in Germany, which is…something.",
      "In order to fulfil his potential, the ex-Villa youngster should leave the Premier League, but his Dortmund spell hints that a Europa League or Conference League outfit could be the way to go. Recommending RB Leipzig completely contradicts that, but that’s what we’re doing. The important thing is, they surely won’t miss out on Europe again this season.",
      "Leipzig have a proven track record of developing young talents. Just look at Xavi Simons and Benjamin Sesko. Both are set to move clubs for a combined ~£130m this summer. Chukwuemeka should become the second Englishman to play for Red Bull FC after Emile Smith Rowe.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nIt’s fair to say Mainoo is ‘available’. He’s not ‘up for sale’ or anything of the sort, but United would listen to offers for their academy graduate to help ease their Profit and Sustainability worries. The 20-year-old holds the pure profit key, which doesn’t just unlock the ability to reinvest, but also unlocks the part of the brain that makes you think it’s okay to sell your most promising youngster and someone who’s been at the club since they were seven to sign someone from abroad. Don’t tell Matt Law.",
      "Mainoo was one of the very few positives for the Red Devils in 2023/24, until they won the FA Cup, which was quite a big positive. His breakout season was fantastic and a reason for the miserable Old Trafford faithful to be optimistic. Last season was less fruitful for the young midfielder, despite a big Euro 2024 with England. Still, United shouldn’t be considering cashing in. But, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. And Manchester United are a circus.",
      "Chelsea? The upside is gargantuan, but the downside is career-threatening. We don’t want their bloated squad to completely bugger Mainoo’s development. Yet, there’s a strong chance he could go there and become one of the world’s leading midfielders.",
      "And then there’s Spurs. Yes, these guys again. Not Real Madrid, who Defensa Central reckon are interested. Mainoo is more of a box-to-box midfielder than a creative one, or even a deep-lying No.6. Frank loves energy and Mainoo can bring that in abundance. It shouldn’t be a case of ‘Elliott or Mainoo?’ for the Londoners; they can get both and give them the playing time they want.",
      "",
      "Tyler Morton (Liverpool)\nWe’ll truly find out if young Morton is available in due course, with Lyon reportedly keen on signing him from Liverpool. Should the Reds reject the French side’s offer, it will become clear that he’s not for sale, or that the club’s asking price has not been met.",
      "There have been Club Brugge, Braga, Celtic, Ajax and West Ham links but Lyon’s interest is serious. They’ve just lost a key midfield figure in Jordan Veretout and are clearly impressed by the 22-year-old’s Under-21 European Championship campaign with England. He played five of the Young Lions’ six games as they went back-to-back, assisting in the final victory over old foes Germany.",
      "He has also spent time on loan at Hull City and Blackburn Rovers in the Championship, with opportunities at Anfield hard to come by. He has 14 appearances, which shows he hasn’t been completely ignored, but it’s definitely time to move on and become a regular for a top-flight team.",
      "Lyon can provide him with that platform and with only a year left on his Liverpool contract, might get a deal done for a very decent price.",
      "READ NEXT: Liverpool 2) and 7) in top 11(?!) best Premier League transfer windows ever",

      "Manchester United’s continued struggles in the transfer market under INEOS have put head coach Ruben Amorim in a precarious position. There is much left to do in the final weeks of this summer’s transfer window, which has not brought about the level of seismic change required after last season’s misery.",
      "Their two marquee signings, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, dramatically improve United‘s No.10 department and the same can be said up front once Benjamin Sesko joins the Red Devils after ‘making his final decision’ to snub Newcastle United.",
      "All that remains is for United chiefs to settle on a price with RB Leipzig and while they are ‘hoping’ to pay €70m (£60m) rather than €80m (£69m), the prolonged prelude to them buckling to Brentford for Mbeumo suggests they will cave again and agree to pay the larger fee for their desired striker.",
      "Man Utd would likely have no qualms about paying the set fee for Sesko were they to recoup funds through player sales, but their blatant desperation to offload members of their bomb squad (and baffling £160m valuation) has been their undoing, as most remain in the building.",
      "After United’s recruitment team set out a pre-summer plan to fund signings through the sales of outcasts, it is looking increasingly likely that more dispensable stars will follow Barcelona newbie Marcus Rashford in leaving on loan as a last resort.",
      "And with two signing priorities remaining after Sesko, the loan market could be the only solution for INEOS as these five potential transfers represent an underwhelming end to the window for the Premier League giants…",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea (loan with buy option)\nSo much for Man Utd getting £70m for Garnacho…",
      "The 21-year-old is one of the few current United stars who hold value, though that is due to his huge potential and not the dire form/attitude that derailed his 2024/25 campaign.",
      "It is easy to foresee Garnacho, like Rashford, shining in a new environment, but Man Utd and Amorim’s very public stance on his future has impacted their negotiating power, as even the most sellable of their bomb squad is yet to secure a move elsewhere.",
      "Still, Garnacho is not without interest and this saga reeks of a club capitalising on Man Utd softening their stance on his exit in the final days of this window, and said team could be Chelsea after he passed ‘background checks’ in a repeat of last summer’s deal for Jadon Sancho as they remain interested, despite already being flooded with attacking options.",

      "David Ornstein’s inferior, Fabrizio Romano, has revealed that Man Utd are unwilling to “spend money” on a new goalkeeper as they prioritise Sesko, so it makes sense that Pope’s name has been brought up and he would be a safe pair of hands in the short term.",
      "But it’s hard to see him dislodging Andre Onana as United’s No.1 at a time when a new starter is required after the Cameroon international’s shambolic fall to calamity after a steady debut season. An up-and-coming goalkeeper or even Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez would be a better fit than 33-year-old Pope to fix this glaring weak spot.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho to Aston Villa (loan)\nOne of many mistakes made by Man Utd last summer was to give Chelsea an easy out in a clause to send Sancho back to Old Trafford for a measly £5m, which was a no-brainer to activate after his uninspiring stint at Stamford Bridge.",
      "This means Man Utd are back to square one with Sancho after a season apart, and this is becoming an increasingly common pattern at the club as the decision-makers settle on loan-to-buy deals to kick their problems down the road for next year.",
      "Sancho’s mixed spell at Chelsea – but particularly his huge salary – leaves him waiting until the close of the window for a solution.",
      "Aston Villa, as they did with Rashford, could follow up their interest and offer him sanctuary away from Old Trafford, but only on an initial loan before a possible free transfer in 2026, as their board know what they are doing.",
      "Alternatively, he could return to Dortmund after making a ‘sacrifice’.",
      "",
      "Antony to Real Betis (loan with buy option)\nThe £80m flop is United’s fifth-worst signing since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, but he headed into this summer as a hot commodity following his remarkable 14-goal involvement stint at Real Betis, in which he came close to matching his overall tally of 17 for the Red Devils in 70 (yes, SEVENTY) fewer matches.",
      "From United being unlikely to attract £10m bids for Antony to their £30m valuation being fully justified amid shock Bayern Munich interest, it was quite the turnaround for Antony, though his future remains unsettled.",
      "Rumblings on Antony’s future have been limited, yet he has recently ‘rejected two offers’ to leave as he and Real Betis seem content in the knowledge that they want to reunite this summer.

      "Mainoo struggled in an injury-impacted 2024/25 campaign after his sensational breakout season in 2023/24 and he has attracted interest from Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Earlier this month, a report claimed Spurs have made contact with Man Utd over signing Mainoo, but it currently seems that he is unlikely to leave his boyhood club.",
      "After opening the door to his exit in the winter window, a report from Football Insider claims Man Utd have ‘made a transfer U-turn’ on the centre-midfielder, while former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown reckons they were “crazy” to “consider letting him go”.",

And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",

      "",
      "3) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "4) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",

      "The Red Devils are looking to sign a new goalkeeper in the off-season after Andre Onana failed to convince last term, and Gianluigi Donnarumma has emerged a surprise option in the last few days as the trail to Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez has gone cold.",
      "The Italian – valued by Transfermarkt at €40m [£34m] – is said to be assessing his options this this summer as he enters the last 12 months of his deal, with PSG closing in on the signing of Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.",
      "Fabrizio Romano wrote on X on Tuesday: ‘Paris Saint-Germain are at final stages of Lucas Chevalier deal, here we go soon!",
      "‘€40m [£35m] deal being sorted directly between presidents Al Khelaifi and Letang as Lille ask for more add-ons, but very close. Chevalier accepted a five year deal last week.’",
      "PSG want to avoid losing Donnarumma for nothing next summer, and amid reported interest from Chelsea and other suitors, a report on Wednesday claimed United are now the ‘frontrunners’ for the 26-year-old’s signature and that ‘in the last few hours their chances have increased significantly’.",
      "When asked about reported Man Utd interest in Donnarumma, Romano added: “I’m not aware of movements at this stage. Man United want a new goalkeeper but the numbers have to be right.”",
      "The transfer expert has now claimed that there’s still a chance the Italy international will remain at the Parcs des Princes.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Gigio Donnarumma and his camp do not rule out to stay at Paris Saint-Germain. Even with contract expiring in June 2026 and Chevalier coming soon, Gigio could stay and compete for his spot as he did with Navas… …and then, decide his future in the next months.’",
      "But former footballer turned journalist Jan Aage Fjørtoft insists United are making progress in their bid to land Donnarumma.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Donnarumma and Manchester United There were some reports yesterday that this was a non-starter. That’s not correct! Just been told that this process is ON. There are talks going on.’",
      "Paris-based journalist Fabrice Hawkins previously explained how United were just one of several clubs interested in the Italy shot stopper.",
      "On Monday, he said: “Gianluigi Donnarumma has not yet left, even though his agents are exploring the market to find him a new destination.",
      "“The Italian goalkeeper has options. Manchester United, Manchester City, Galatasaray, and Saudi clubs are interested. However, he remains attached to PSG and will only leave if a project fully suits him.",
      "“Internally, the possibility of seeing Chevalier and Donnarumma compete, with Luis Enrique making the final decision, is not ruled out.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the truth about rumours that Man Utd could sign Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now the ‘frontrunners’ to sign PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer after James Trafford returned to Man City.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have picked out their ‘next big target’ after landing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly ‘decided to sell’ a ‘top name’ on Manchester United’s ‘shortlist’ to replace a current starter at Old Trafford.",

For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins.

However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",

      "8) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible?

The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",

As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow.",

      "5) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle and Liverpool are currently at a stand-off, with Isak in the middle. Newcastle have received no bid yet, and the Reds are holding fire, knowing that time only increases the pressure on the Magpies. They are still intent on digging in, even if it means convincing Isak to stay for one more season, and are unlikely to sanction a sale without having a replacement sorted first. Sesko is their top target, but Man United are also there.. Given Isak left it so late to declare his wishes and Liverpool have already signed a striker in his place, it is easy to imagine this being kicked down the road until next summer. For now we wait until Liverpool show their hand.",

      "2)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms and a fee agreed. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",

      "1) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, Ramsdale is having a medical on Thursday before the Toon pay £4million to borrow him for the season with the option of a more permanent arrangement.",

      "Xabi Alonso has his eye on two Premier League midfielders as Real Madrid ‘open the door’ to a double swoop which would cost Los Blancos £142m.",
      "Madrid have spent around £150m so far this summer, with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen, Franco Mastantuono and Alvaro Carreras all arriving to bolster the squad ahead of Alonso’s first season at the helm.",
      "The former Bayer Leverkusen manager is thought to be keen on adding a target man to his ranks in the mould of ex-Madrid striker Joselu, but is also after a new midfielder who can dictate play from the base of midfield, as he used to do in his time at the Bernabeu.",
      "They’ve been linked with Manchester City’s Rodri, Chelsea’s Enzo Fernández and Liverpool star Alexis Mac Allister, but there’s said to be ‘reluctance’ from president Florentino Perez to make such a ‘galactic’ signing this summer, with the Madrid boss ‘opening the door to a planned signing with pause and measure’.",
      "Defensa Central don’t explicitly say that means the La Liga giants are happy to wait until next year to sign a new defensive midfielder, but that’s the implication.",
      "And Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo is said to be one of two Premier League players Alonso ‘wants’ amid a ‘change in focus’ to ‘alternatives more focused on the future’.",
      "After a report last week claimed Tottenham had ‘made contact’ with United over a possible move for Mainoo – who was previously valued at £70m by the Red Devils, but is now thought to be available for just £42m – manager Ruben Amorim warned the academy graduate that he won’t be a guaranteed starter next season unless he increases his tempo of play.",
      "Amorim said: “I think he can play in both positions [No 6 and No 10] in the midfield. Last year, he played more in front.",
      "“His perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball. He’s a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. He needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I’m always on top of that with Kobbie because he is so good sometimes, but he can be better.",
      "“So I have big plans but, like I said, it’s one game per week and the competition is going to be huge. Everybody has to be prepared to play one game, or play all the games, that is a key point in our season.”",
      "The Spanish outlet also names Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton as another midfielder Alonso is a big admirer of.",
      "It was claimed last month that Wharton is ‘ready to wait’ for Liverpool to come calling next summer amid interest from Tottenham, with Palace currently not willing to listen to offers for their £100m man with the futures of both Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi in doubt.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Both players are old acquaintances of the Madrid skimmers. The scouting team that responds to Juni Calafat has always maintained a follow-up of promising young people in the Premier League, where the names of the Crystal Palace midfielder and the Manchester United midfielder, respectively, always stood out.",
      "‘In England, as we have been able to see from Central Defense, they understand that Real Madrid is looking for an incorporation for the near future. The progression of Adam Wharton and Kobbie Mainoo is brilliant, but they have not yet stood out enough to integrate into the orbit of the football elite of the Old Continent. That is why the follow-up carried out to date will be intensified under the orders of Xabi Alonso.’",
      "These four English youngsters are set to move clubs this summer and we’ve tried to predict where they’ll end up, with Spurs snapping up two starlets…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to perform a ‘U-turn’ on the ‘crazy’ sale of one Red Devils star, who is ‘happy’ to remain at the club.",
      "Tottenham have ‘made contact’ over a potential deal to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo this summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd face a ‘dilemma’ over the future of Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Tottenham amid claims the midfielder’s agent is ‘not asking for too much money’.",
      "Tottenham have made an approach to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as his contract saga drags on, according to reports.",
      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…"

      "“And sometimes some players who are younger and maybe want to develop in a different way, maybe they are scared to go to Newcastle and not having the opportunity to leave the club in maybe two or three years.",

      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has emerged as Man Utd's top target with club holding initial talks over conditions of a deal; Newcastle also interested but Sesko thought to prefer Man Utd move",
      "Thursday 31 July 2025 07:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have held initial talks with RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old has emerged as a top target for Manchester United in this window if they sign a striker.",
      "Exploratory talks have also been held with Sesko's representatives and it is understood that while Manchester United are keen to sign him, it will not be a simple deal to do financially.",
      "Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought, as it stands, Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.",
      "The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.",
      "United's interest in Sesko is long-standing, having kept an eye on his development for a number of years.",
      "While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.",
      "Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "However, the prices and structure for those players have been deemed too high at this stage.",
      "While Sesko would cost more than Watkins overall, it's thought a more favourable structure could be struck with Leipzig.",
      "Sesko has a gentleman's agreement in place with Leipzig and they will not stand in his way should an appropriate offer arrive.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund responded to Man Utd's interest in Sesko by scoring the opening goal in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth on Thursday.",
      "Hojlund struggled in his first season at United but boss Ruben Amorim believes his side are playing better because of Hojlund's improvement.",
      "\"The important thing I think is that people focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,\" he said. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long].",
      "\"The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.\"",
      "The United boss doubled down on his praise for Hojlund when asked a direct question about interest in Sesko.",
      "\"I'm really happy with Rasmus,\" said Amorim. \"I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford? And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",

      "Wednesday 30 July 2025 17:11, UK",
      "Manchester United have made Benjamin Sesko their top transfer target - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "The 22-year-old was wanted by Arsenal earlier in the transfer window but Manchester United are now interested after the Gunners moved for Viktor Gyokeres - who used to be managed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford?",
      "And with a release clause between £68m and £86m, could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "Like Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, Sesko could help add counter-attacking threat to a Manchester United side that only scored four fast-break goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness might be part of his appeal to Manchester United.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "It is likely another part of his appeal to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to Old Trafford would bring considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United."

      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",

      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",

      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",

      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",

      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",

He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
