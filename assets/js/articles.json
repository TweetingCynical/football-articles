      "Ruben Amorim will hope to rejuvinate his team when the transfer window reopens on June 16. The club are hoping to strengthen their head coach's forward line and the team as a whole.",
      "United have already confirmed a number of departures from Old Trafford, and more could follow. The likes of Casemiro faces an uncertain few weeks as he enters the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "It will not be an easy summer however, with the club having already missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, and sales required to boost funds for incoming deals. There is a lot of work to do.",

      "United are said to have enquired over the terms of a prospective deal. The Bundesliga side have stood firm on their valuation of the 22-year-old thus far, insisting on a €100m (85m) fee.",

      "David Beckham declared himself \"immensely proud\" after being bestowed with a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours. Beckham, who turned 50 last month, has been given the honour for his services to sport and charity.",
      "The former England captain, who won 115 caps for the Three Lions, with 59 of those as captain and Manchester United icon has become one of the most recognisable faces on the planet, known as well in Los Angeles as he is in Auckland and pretty much everywhere in between.",
      "Speaking about his knighthood, Beckham said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour.

      "It has been a rollercoaster ride for Beckham, who used to earn £10 a shift collecting glasses at Walthamstow dog track before heading to United's academy as part of the fabled 'Class of 92', where, after making his Premier League debut in 1994, he truly announced himself as a star on the opening day of the 1996-97 season, with a memorable goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.",
      "The red card at France '98 and the subsequent fallout has never been forgotten - least of all by himself. In a Netflix documentary series, released during October 2023, Beckham revealed he still cannot forgive himself for the abuse his family suffered amid the fallout, which include a pub hanging up an effigy of Beckham, and the hostility he faced at grounds around the country the following season. He admitted it left him a \"mess\".",
      "And yet, he not only went on to be an integral part of United's Treble success in 1999 - winning six Premier League titles and two FA Cups too during his time at Old Trafford - he became England captain just two years after his dismissal in Saint-Etienne, became a one-man wrecking crew to drag the national side kicking and screaming to the 2002 World Cup with a virtuoso display and 93rd minute equaliser against Greece - and there, in Japan and South Korea, completed his redemption story with the winner against Argentina during the group stage.",
      "At the height of his footballing fame, fronting global brands and married to a pop star, he became a Galactico in 2003, joining Real Madrid in a £25million move after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and refusing to join Barcelona, having made almost 400 appearances for United and scoring 85 goals.",
      "Beckham would go on to win La Liga before he departed for LA Galaxy in 2007 and collected the MLS Cup twice, spending two loan stints at AC Milan along the way. In January 2013, Beckham returned to Europe with Paris Saint Germain, later announcing his decision to retire when he signed off with a Ligue 1 winners’ medal.",
      "During his time in the States he had already been thinking about life after football, a remarkable business move during his time in MLS allowing him to become co-owner of Inter Miami in 2020 at a cut price rate, while a multi-million-pound lifetime deal with Adidas, signed in 2003, had long since secured his financial future away from the game.",
      "Beckham, who was made an OBE for services to football in 2003, has long been involved with children’s charity UNICEF, and is a co-owner of film production company Studio 99.",
      "In 2024 he was appointed Ambassador for The King’s Foundation which works globally to create sustainable communities through placemaking projects and also transform lives through practical education programmes.",
      "Certainly, there has been no shortage of controversy, whether during his footballing career or after. But now, the man known in some quarters as 'Becks', and infamously also as 'Golden Balls', becomes Sir David.",

      "The situation surrounding Viktor Gyokeres is really starting to spiral as he pushes to leave Sporting Lisbon. Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in all competitions for Sporting this season, but is now keen to move on and test himself in the Premier League.",
      "The Sweden international snubbed a move to Saudi Arabia and Al Hilal this week, which would’ve earned him in the region of £500k-per-week. Both Manchester United - where former mentor Ruben Amorim - and Arsenal are pursuing a new No.9 this summer, and Gyokeres is keen to join either.",
      "As he does so, the fallout in Portugal is getting increasingly bitter. It has been claimed that Gyokeres is willing to go on strike to force a move away from Sporting after suggestions they’ve been increasing their asking price in talks with potential buyers, having, it’s claimed by the Gyokeres camp, to sell him for a set fee.",
      "To that end, Gyokeres has an £85million release clause in his contract, but his representatives have claimed a deal worth a total £59m had been agreed with Sporting chiefs and that that was what they are expecting him to be sold for this summer.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas hit out in response, insisting he would not be bullied into selling his club’s prized asset: \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Gyokeres himself followed that up on social media, declaring: “There is a lot of talk at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.”",
      "Now, Gyokeres' agent, Hakan Cetinkaya, had appeared to come out - according to Swedish media - and claim that he has written proof of the £59m agreement. Except he didn’t say it. Gyokeres representative didn’t make the comment, as first reported by Record.",
      "Which leaves the whole situation just looking increasingly messy. And for the two Premier League clubs who may be interested - United are prioritising Bryan Mbeumo before moving onto a No.9 while Arsenal are understood to prefer Benjamin Sesko over Gyokeres - it's looking increasingly expensive too.",

According to those close to Newcastle, it's because they baulked at the Bees' transfer demands, but more particularly the Cameroon international's salary demands. Those close to the player claim he wasn't interested in a move to the North East.",
      "Instead, the No.1 choice has been Manchester United, who have made him their top target after tying up a deal for Wolves star Matheus Cunha. Offers have been made, but United have fallen short of Brentford's demands, a first offer of £45million up front with £10m in add-ons rejected, before a second bid was also turned down.",
      "Spurs have launched a £70m bid, worth £65m plus £5m in add-ons. All told, it's £10m more than United's last offer, with more guaranteed.",
      "It's understood Mbeumo still prefers to join United. Certainly they have the edge when it comes to wages, as the salary on offer at Old Trafford is between £150,000-£175,000-a-week with bonuses taking Mbeumo’s expected package to £200,000-a-week.",
      "Spurs would have to break their strict wage structure to match that, with Mbeumo expected to earn around £130,000-£140,000-a-week. Bonuses would still see it fall short of the cash he would pick up at United.",
      "But as Spurs were making their move on Friday afternoon - and before it hit the public domain - Mbeumo himself stoked the transfer rumour flame on social media, amid suggestions he's reconsidering his options. Until then, Mbeumo hadn't reacted to Frank's departure as Brentford boss, but the 25-year-old duly used his Instagram account to do just that, sharing Brentford's post confirming Frank's exit - almost 24 hours later - captioning it with two prayer emojis.",
      "Let's just say it's open to interpretation what they meant. Thank you? Please take me with you? Ultimately the proof will be in the pudding.",
      "Intriguingly, Frank was candid about his desire to continue working with Mbeumo while still Brentford boss, comments that speak volumes about his thoughts of the player.",
      "\"I'm the head coach. I want my best players to stay forever\" he said. \"I know that Bryan is very happy being here at Brentford, he's thriving, doing well and playing fantastic. What happens in the future? I don't know.",
      "\"I've said many times, we are a selling club. But at the same time, we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world that aren't selling clubs. So, of course, if the right price - and that's going to be expensive - is coming, then I'm sure the club will be open for it.",
      "\"But I'm very happy he's here, and I'm convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.\"",
      "Now, Frank is preparing to be happy elsewhere. The question is whether Mbeumo will be happy with him."

      "“It is the most common phrase that you can say at this moment, but this is the dream come true,” he told MUTV. “Maybe outside, I think maybe my decision, they don’t understand. But when you have always dreamed to play here, it’s easier to pick this decision.",

      "Gyokeres is good friends with fellow goal machine, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, and could soon be rivalling him – and Liverpool's Mo Salah – for the crown of the Premier League's top scorer.",
      "United is the logical destination for him, where he would be reunited with former boss Amorim, but Arsenal are also determined to land the 27-year-old Sweden star.",
      "Gyokeres has enjoyed a meteoric rise, from being let go by Brighton, to a spell at Coventry, then to Sporting and now on the brink of a mega-money move to the Premier League.",
      "It was at Coventry where Gyokeres first came up with his unique goal celebration, one which sees him cross both hands over his mouth, to form a mask.",
      "Debate has raged over the meaning of the celebration, with former Coventry team-mate Josh Eccles suggesting it is a nod to the character Hannibal Lecter in the film Silence of the Lambs. \"He [Hannibal Lecter] eats people and Viktor destroys defences,\" said Eccles.",
      "Others believe the celebration was inspired by the masked villain Bane, from the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises. What is certain is that Gyokeres has been feasting on defences in Portugal and all over Europe since joining Sporting and has proved as deadly as Bane and Hannibal Lecter.",
      "A remarkable haul of 97 goals from 102 appearances in two seasons at Sporting has seen Gyokeres become a target for United and Arsenal, who will go head-to-head for him.",
      "Gyokeres served notice of his ability to terrorise Premier League sides in the Champions League last season, with a stunning hat-trick in a 4-1 win for Sporting over Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "As well as averaging more than one goal a game last season, Gyokeres has also scored nine in just six appearances for Sweden, underlining his ability to score at any level.",
      "Those who know Gyokeres well and have worked with him speak of a player with a relentless work ethic, strong mentality, laser focus and a fierce desire to win.",
      "Having just turned 27, Gyokeres is hitting the peak years of his career, which is why United and Arsenal – both crying out for a proven and prolific goalscorer – want to land him.",
      "Having agreed last summer to give Sporting one more season, Gyokeres insists he struck a gentleman's agreement with the club, allowing him to leave for a certain price. Sporting president Frederico Varandas has denied this and is adamant Gyokeres will not be allowed to leave for lower than his release clause of £85million.",
      "Reports from Lisbon suggest Gyokeres is willing to go on strike to get the move he wants, a move dismissed by Varandas and the Sporting hierarchy. What seems likely is that the future of Gyokeres will be a protracted saga over the summer, unless United or Arsenal are willing to meet Sporting's valuation.",
      "On the evidence of his phenomenal form of the last two seasons, Gyokeres would appear to be worth it.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "Shaun Wright-Phillips has warned that Manchester United risk alienating their young talents if they opt for a sell-to-buy strategy this summer.",
      "The ex-Manchester City and Chelsea midfielder highlighted the predicament of Alejandro Garnacho, who seems to have fallen out of favour with Ruben Amorim. Wright-Phillips also expressed concern over 20-year-old Kobbie Mainoo's situation, as he looks to be struggling to adapt to his manager's system.",
      "Wright-Phillips suggests that academy product Mainoo and Garnacho, who was bought for £420,000, could be seen as valuable assets. The United board appears willing to let the duo leave for a substantial fee in order to alleviate concerns over Profit and Sustainability Rules.",
      "Marcus Rashford, another homegrown talent, also looks set to bring in a hefty sum for United this summer. With the club facing financial difficulties after a disastrous season that saw them miss out on European football, significant player sales may be needed to boost their transfer funds.",
      "\"I don't think they should be getting rid of key players like that,\" Wright-Phillips told Betway. \"Because the same thing in many ways has happened to Kobbie Mainoo without even saying anything. He's just not been playing either and he was that golden child, as well, about a year ago.",
      "\"It's either that or they're trying to raise money from players they've not had to pay for. Because some of their selling, I'm not really understanding.\"",
      "Garnacho was limited to just 20 minutes in United's Europa League final defeat by Tottenham. The 20-year-old now finds himself on the brink of an Old Trafford exit with teams such as Chelsea and Napoli linked with the Argentinian for around £50m-£60m.",
      "The young winger hit out after the humbling loss in Bilbao, branding United's season \"s**t\" and adding that he would wait to see what his future holds. Wright-Phillips believes that Amorim and United have poorly handled Garnacho's situation. \"It's a hard one because I do think he's a fantastic winger,\" Wright-Phillips added.",
      "\"I like wingers that try and take on their defenders, entertain, because that's what I based my game off –entertaining the crowd, trying to make the full-back's life hell. Garnacho does that in multiple ways.",
      "\"He was obviously hurt by the decision not to start him in the final, which, to be honest, I didn't understand either, considering he had started all the other games and played really well in most of them.\"",
      "He continued: \"But before the game, the manager's seen something tactically different – whether it worked or didn't work. When he brings him on, that's when the game changed, and it was more United than Spurs, because he was causing them all sorts of problems.",
      "\"It obviously hurt him deeply, and I think the manager should have just pulled him aside and said, 'Look, I know you were hurt, but you could have just come and said it to me, you didn't have to go public'. But he's gone public. I just think there's a better way for the manager and the club to handle it.\"",

      "United agreed a £62.5million deal to bring Cunha into the side as their first signing of the summer, while the club have announced nine players will depart. Amorim's team have already shown their ambition to reinforce their forward line after a sub-par season in front of goal but Cunha's arrival is just the start.",

      "The new Premier League season is still some way away, but clubs have been giving their fans plenty to get excited about. For some, that means new signings, but for others the 2025-26 kits are the main talking point.",
      "It has become a habit of some sides to debut new kits at the end of the previous season, while others wait longer. At the time of writing, fewer than half of the 20 teams in England's top tier have shared their new releases, but we'll be updating you throughout the summer as the newest home and away kits drop.",
      "There will often be variety in new kit releases, though this is more likely to come with the change strips than with the home efforts. Traditional colours aren't tampered with quite as regularly - though there are some exceptions.",
      "This time last year, we were starting to see the first of the 2024-25 kits. If you want to refresh your memory, you can look back at our complete ranking of the home and away shirts unveiled by the Premier League's clubs last term.",
      "Those of you who liked last season's efforts might be dreading what's to come, while if you weren't a fan of last year's you might be giving your team a shot at redemption this summer. Without further ado, here are the kits which have been released so far.",
      "Arsenal released their new home kit before the end of the 2024-25 season, allowing their players to wear it for the home Premier League closer against Newcastle. The adidas shirt is red with white shoulders and a red trim, and puts a gothic letter 'A' on the badge at the forefront in a nod to the 1990-91 title winning season.",
      "\"I love our new kit, it looks fresh - I'm excited to wear this in front of our incredible supporters,\" Arsenal and England defender Myles Lewis-Skelly said when the kit was released. \"Their energy lifts us and when we step out in the shirt, we feel it more than ever.\"",
      "Aston Villa's away shirt for the 2024-25 season was all white, but that will change for the upcoming campaign. The new dark away shirt made its first appearance on the final day, when Unai Emery's side lost at Manchester United to miss out on Champions League qualification.",
      "As the club explained, the new design also carries a nod to Villa's home city of Birmingham. \"The design on the shoulders is inspired by the Bullring, one of the iconic landmarks on the skyline of Birmingham and where the club’s new store opens today - meaning both fans and players alike will wear the fabric of our city,\" the club explained along with the release in May.",
      "Chelsea were the first Premier League club to release both their home and away shirts. Both were unveiled before the Blues' Club World Cup campaign, with that competition beginning in mid-June, with the blue home kit carrying a nod to London - and their specific part of the capital.",
      "\"The fabric of London is woven into every thread of our new kit, which is inspired by the capital’s iconic landmarks and creative culture,\" a club release read. \"Chelsea Town Hall is among the architectural landmarks subtly featured on the shirt, which was unveiled by Chelsea and Nike today.\"",
      "We've also now seen Chelsea's new away kit. Players from the men's and women's teams got involved in the launch of the white away shirt with red and green trim - a nod to a 70s design.",
      "\"There is an artistic feel to our new away kit, with the photoshoot taking place at Saatchi Gallery on the King’s Road and the colour palette inspired by a cult classic kit from days gone by,\" the club announced. \"Our manager from the early 1970s, Dave Sexton, introduced an away strip back then which was a tribute to Hungary’s famous ‘Magnificent Magyars’ team from two decades earlier and it evolved into a white shirt with a broad red and green vertical stripe.\"",
      "Manchester City have shown it is possible to keep traditional colours and still get a bit creative. Their 2025-26 home kit will predominantly be sky blue, as usual, but with a white sash.",
      "City also have a sash on their change strip for the Club World Cup, which is predominantly white, in a nod to their 2009-10 away kit. However, this will just be used for the tournament, with City confirming a new away kit will be unveiled ahead of the upcoming league season.",
      "Manchester United won't have a chance to show off their new home kit in Europe, having lost in the final of last season's Europa League. However, they've wasted little time showing off what they will wear next term.",
      "United's new shirt has adidas' famous three stripes in black on the shoulders, while there is also a graphic on the sleeves inspired by the club's Old Trafford Stadium. It's capped off by the words 'Theatre of Dreams' just below the collar on the back.",
      "\"The colour red is fundamental to the club's DNA. There have been many different expressions of it over the years and, for this season, we wanted to do something a little different, using the sleeves as a canvas,\" adidas' Jurgen Rank said. \"The abstract graphic stays true to the club's DNA while providing an innovative look and feel to an otherwise classy and classic jersey.\"",
      "It's black and white again for Newcastle - no surprises there - but with a twist. The classic stripes are blended with a shepherd's check for a slightly different take on the usual colours.",
      "Newcastle debuted the kit at the end of last season against Everton, when they qualified for the Champions League despite losing their home closer. The club has also pledged to donate £5 per shirt sold to the Newcastle United Foundation.",
      "\"It’s a way for supporters to not only wear the badge, and the beautiful new kits with pride, but to directly contribute to the life-changing work the Foundation does across the region,\" chief commercial officer Peter Silverstone said. \"Together, we’re making a difference – on and off the pitch.”",
      "Spurs didn't just appoint a new manager in the first half of June - they also unveiled their new home shirt. The Europa League winners now know what they will be wearing as they look to build under that success under new boss Thomas Frank.",
      "\"The 2025/26 Kit features a subtle tweak to the navy sleeves of last season, with a new grey and ashen slate pattern under the arm and the traditional lilywhite base forming the outer part of the sleeve,\" the club announced when unveiling the new Nike shirt. The kit release was accompanied by a video featuring club legend Ledley King.",

      "The former Blackburn Rovers and Birmingham City defender would often bring his football-mad son to work, where Toffees favourites like Wayne Rooney and Duncan Ferguson kindly took him under their wing. However, it was one of their opponents who Ollie was most starstruck by as a youngster - Manchester United legend Ronaldo.",
      "Mick revealed how it led to a very awkward encounter with the Portuguese forward in a corridor after a match between Everton and United. The incident, which left Ronaldo distinctly unimpressed, occurred after Ollie tasked his dad with getting his shirt signed by his idol.",
      "Recounting the episode in his book, The Smell of Football, Mick said: \"Sometimes, I must admit, when surrounded by these superstars, I just wanted to grab a pen and piece of paper and get their autographs, but this was frowned upon as being totally uncool.",
      "\"A few years ago, however, when we played United, Ollie begged me to get Cristiano Ronaldo's autograph on his brand new Portugal shirt that he had just received for his birthday. I really didn’t like to ask and did feel a bit of an anorak, but you know what it's like - you will do anything for your kids, won't you?",
      "\"I kept my eyes open after the game to try and catch sight of Ronaldo passing the medical room. Eventually, I saw him and stepped into the busy passageway, clutching the shirt. I was in my full Everton regalia, so I didn't feel too much of an intruder.",
      "\"'Excuse me, Cristiano, could you please sign this for my son?' He didn't look too pleased, but grabbed the shirt and the pen without looking up or acknowledging my existence, and started scribbling. 'Can you write, 'To Oliver, happy birthday' on it please Cristiano?' He still didn't look up but just kept scribbling.",
      "\"'It’s O-L-I-V…' I didn't get any further. He just threw the shirt back in my face where, due to the phenomenon that is static electricity, it stuck. He then walked away, leaving me with the shirt on my head.\"",

      "Ollie got a taste of life at United for himself as a youngster after coming up through the club's academy at the same time as the likes of Marcus Rashford. The 28-year-old spent eight years with the Red Devils before joining Rochdale in 2016 due to a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "He later signed for Rotherham, where he enjoyed a three-year stint, until moving to Wrexham for £500,000 last summer.

      "Manchester United should sign Victor Osimhen this summer instead of Viktor Gyokeres. That's according to Rio Ferdinand, who reckons the Nigerian striker is a better fit for his former club. The Red Devils struggled for firepower this season, with Rasmus Hojlund finding the net just four times in the Premier League.",
      "Last summer's marquee signing Joshua Zirkzee has also failed to impress at Old Trafford, with just three league goals in 32 games. With just 44 goals registered as a team - the second lowest amount in the Premier League outside of a relegated Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester - it is clear that United need to bring a talisman to the north west in the coming months.",
      "And Ruben Amorim is eager to welcome fresh faces to overhaul his inherited squad. United have already struck a £62.5million deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, and are trying to work out terms with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Another name linked with the Red Devils is Sporting CP sensation Gyokeres, who scored 39 goals and provided eight assists to help his side clinch the Primeira Liga title this season. However, Ferdinand believes Napoli's Osimhen is a better option, given he has far more experience than the 27-year-old Swede.",
      "\"So, I think you need someone in all the good teams you see. They normally have at least one of the attacking players, normally the number nine. And you go, actually, yeah, I can pin my hat on him. I can rely on him.",
      "\"And I think Hojlund's lack of experience has been a big factor. So, a striker, I don't want any striker. I think I've said it on my podcast many times. I think a striker with experience, knows his right way around the football field, who the young ones they've invested in, like Hojlund and Zirkzee and Chido [Obi] can learn from.\"",
      "On Gyokeres, he added: \"I think Gyokeres, everyone's talking about him. Again, I think if I'm looking at the market now and I had to pick him or Osimhen, I'd probably pick Osimhen because of that experience.",
      "\"And he's shown he's done it in multiple leagues now. And he's done it internationally as well. I think he's a top-class number nine who, again, the young players will be able to learn from. I'm not saying that Gyokeres would fail. I'm just saying that if I had a preference, I would go there.\"",
      "If United are to sign Gyokeres, they will have to beat Arsenal to the punch, with Mikel Arteta also linked with the star striker in a bid to bolster his own strike force for 2025/26.",
      "Gyokeres's contract has a reported £85m release clause, so the Red Devils could be forced to pay in excess for his services, given that he is contracted with Sporting until 2028. Club president Frederico Varandas also recently announced that interested parties will have to part ways with more than his £59m price tag.",
      "Osimhen, meanwhile, is unsettled at Napoli, but the club will still want big money to part ways with him this summer. A £63m deal with Al-Hilal was reportedly accepted by the Serie A giants recently, only for the 26-year-old to decide against a move to the Middle East.",
      "However, with Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus all thought to be interested in the striker, Manchester United will again face stiff competition for his signature.",
      "Ferdinand's comments come as he launches his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, with hopes of connecting teenagers and parents in planning their futures. Speaking about the cause, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",

The former Manchester United star is expected to succeed Miron Muslic, who masterminded the FA Cup win over Liverpool but left for Schalke last month.",
      "Cleverley meanwhile is out of a job having been sacked by Watford last month. He had led the Hornets to a 14th-place finish in the second tier in his first full season.",
      "Plymouth had spoken to four candidates about their vacancy with Cleverley emerging as the frontrunner. Former Arsenal star Jack Wilshere, who had been caretaker boss at Norwich, was also interviewed but looks set to miss out according to the Guardian.",

      "The Pilgrims knew their relegation was all but confirmed ahead of the final day with a hugely inferior goal difference meaning they were ultimately down. They were beaten by Leeds at Home Park which bought an end to their two-year stay in the Championship.",
      "Their demise began with Wayne Rooney at the helm. Cleverley's former team-mate at Old Trafford was handed another managerial gig in the Championship but struggled for results. He won five of his 25 games before he was shown the door just after Christmas.",
      "He left Plymouth sitting in the relegation zone and, despite an upturn in form that saw them down the likes of Sheffield United, they couldn't save themselves and will hope to bounce back at the first time of asking. They are among the pre-season favourites for promotion.",
      "Rooney has said on his stint: \"I loved my time there - I think the fans were great, the staff were great. We just hit a bad run of form and the players actually you know I can't fault them, they were trying everything. Maybe we just lacked that bit of quality.\"",
      "Rooney's successor, Muslic, appeared to take a swipe at the Evertonian and claimed that the club would never have gone down had he been in charge all season. \"I think if I'm the head coach from day one we will be far, far away from the relegation zone,\" he said previously.",

      "There are some ongoing changes at Manchester United that most fans won't notice.",
      "The revised transfer strategy of signing talented youngsters falls into that category. United have always signed young players to add to their academy, but the profile of targets has evolved.",
      "Sekou Kone (19) was signed from Mali, Diego Leon (18) has been scouted from Paraguay, while Enzo Kana-Biyik (18) is set to arrive on a free transfer from the renowned academy of French club Le Havre AC.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Chido Obi, James Overy, Samuel Lusale and Harley Emsden-James have also been lured to Manchester with the promise of a pathway to first-team football at Old Trafford.",
      "Heaven and Obi have already broken into the senior squad. Ruben Amorim gave opportunities to both players last season and they will be used as a shining example to future targets.",
      "United's transfer strategy has become interesting, although it could be argued they are simply catching up with the times. Premier League rivals have cast their nets around the globe to sign young players with high ceilings, some of whom will never make a first-team appearance in England.",
      "Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have been a huge factor and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea and Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "United sources would deny that young players are being signed to be 'flipped', but the reality is that not every signing will make the grade and some will be sold for profit down the line.",
      "Club sources stress that each young signing in the last 18 months has been made because they have first-team potential, however, that does not guarantee they will make a senior debut.",
      "The transfers are essentially low risk and high reward. For example, United signed Kone for around £1m for Guidars FC and the young midfielder arrived in Manchester with a huge upside.",
      "The best-case scenario is that Kone breaks into the first-team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "Similar signings were made by the previous regime, but they have increased since Ineos gained control of football operations. Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "The club's network of scouts present reports on young players and Kone was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "After following Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where he featured as one of the players of the tournament.",
      "It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",
      "Deals to sign Obi, Overy and Lusale were also arranged last summer. United became aware that Obi wanted to leave Arsenal and was about to join a European club after visiting their training ground.",
      "Nick Cox (head of the academy), Luke Fedderenko (head of academy recruitment), Stephen Ajewole (lead scout) and Sam Williams (lead scout) all played a huge role in signing Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Overy (18) attracted interest from other Premier League clubs but he signed for United, while Lusale (17) was signed from Crystal Palace, and they both went into the U18 squad.",
      "The signing of Emsden-James, 16, from Southampton this summer is similar to those deals. The centre-back will join up with the U18s in 2024/2025 and still has a long way to progress to make a first-team debut.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how United handle Kone, Leon and Kana-Biyik ahead of 2025/2026.",
      "Kone could leave on loan after being given time to find his feet in England, but Leon might be kept within the building so he can adapt to his new surroundings after leaving South America.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in early January and the defender signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year.",
      "It's understood United agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and Leon continued to play in Paraguay with a view to moving to Manchester this summer.",
      "United are expected to formally announce the arrivals of Leon and Kana-Biyik. The latter is joining from Le Havre on a free transfer and only a few regulatory steps remain for him to complete his move.",
      "The highly-regarded Kana-Biyik is a natural striker and he scored nine goals in 16 appearances for the French club's Under-19s last season, while also training with their first-team.",
      "Kana-Biyik has been linked with an immediate loan move to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport, but it's understood that no loan plan has been confirmed for the incoming French youngster.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves does exactly what his job title says on the tin and will continue to try to obtain value during negotiations this summer, wherever that may be found across the world."

      "Hasan Cetinkaya, the agent of Viktor Gyokeres, says he has written proof that Sporting CP promised the striker he could leave for £59million this summer.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, has been linked with a blockbuster move to Manchester United after scoring 54 goals in 52 matches for the Portuguese side in 2024/25. United are intent on signing a new centre-forward this summer to boost Ruben Amorim's options in attack.",
      "It had been reported that the Swede has a 'gentlemen's agreement' in place to leave Sporting for £59m, after he rejected transfer interest last summer. Gyokeres has an £85m release clause but the Portuguese club were said to have agreed for him to depart for much less.",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas revealed in a press conference on Wednesday that there is no agreement for Gyokeres to leave for £59m in the summer transfer window.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" Varandas said. \"To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Reports in Portugal suggested that Gyokeres was left feeling 'disrespected' about the situation and won't return to Sporting for pre-season. It was added that the former Coventry City man would 'rather go on strike' and is willing to 'interrupt his vacation' to speak out about his situation and Sporting's agreement that was in place.",
      "Gyokeres then took to social media to issue an update, as speculation continues to rise on his future. In a story on Instagram, he said: \"There's a lot of talk at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "Now, Gyokeres' agent, Cetinkaya, has become the latest to speak out about the situation. According to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, the businessman stated he has proof of the alleged agreement that he made with Sporting, and Gyokeres can, in fact, leave the club for £59m this summer.",
      "Cetinkaya's comments are the complete contrast to what Vandaras said. \"Sporting will not demand the release clause, but they should know me better by now: threats, blackmail, insults, they don't work with me,\" Vandaras added, as he fumed about the reported gentleman's agreement.",
      "\"I can guarantee one thing: Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60m + €10m. He won't leave because I never allowed it, and with this game that the agent is playing, the situation will only get worse,\" he assured.",
      "While there doesn't seem to be an agreement between Gyokeres, his camp and Sporting, a departure from the Primeira Liga is all-but certain, at this stage. United remain linked, while Arsenal, Chelsea, Barcelona and Juventus are among his other potential suitors."

      "Far from the striker Manchester United needed to sign.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee admitted himself that he wasn't an out-and-out centre forward following his move to United, despite being brought to the club to provide cover and competition for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Zirkzee's tendency to drop into pockets of space meant he was never a genuine candidate to lead United's frontline, though he became something of a cult hero for the way he bounced back from his career nadir against Newcastle, where his first-half removal was sarcastically cheered by some fans.",
      "While his style of play didn't lend itself to leading the attack, the 3-4-2-1 system Ruben Amorim brought with him following his mid-season appointment meant Zirkzee could operate as one of the two No.10s behind the striker. He was still chosen to play as the sole centre forward at times but looked far more comfortable when operating in slightly a deeper role.",
      "United may not have signed him to play as a No.10 but there's no doubting that's where he's looked best since his Old Trafford arrival. Though that doesn't mean he should stay at the club.",
      "For all their issues, United have plenty of options at No.10. Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount could be joined by Bryan Mbeumo on the list of options available to Amorim behind the striker. Bruno Fernandes, Amad and Kobbie Mainoo have all played as a No.10 under Amorim, and so that's six potential options even working under the assumption they manage to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Zirkzee would be ahead of some of the aforementioned players in the No.10 pecking order but it's still difficult to see where he fits in.",
      "United didn't intend to sign a No.10 when they sanctioned a €42.5million move for Zirkzee, yet they stumbled upon a player perfect for Amorim's system.",
      "With an abundance of options already available to them in that position, they need to cash in on the Dutchman this summer."

Ian Foster was appointed in January 2024 but lasted just 14 matches - with then-director of football Neil Dewsnip and first-team coach Kevin Nancekivell taking over and keeping Argyle in the Championship.",

So Pope might be happy to hear that the two clubs are some way off an agreement with Burnley said to be asking for £40million.",

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, but Manchester City have overtaken them.",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Liverpool – £33.7m\nThey idle down on the list after the signing of Jeremie Frimpong and a new third-choice goalkeeper, but they will catapult to the top if they pull off the British record transfer of Florian Wirtz.",
      "",
      "9) Burnley – £35.22m\nLast season’s loans have been made permanent, with Bashir Humphreys the most expensive of the quartet. Now to persuade somebody not already in Burnley to sign for Burnley…",
      "",
      "8) West Ham – £35.4m\nPenny for the thoughts of Graham Potter, who inherited the ‘loan with obligation to buy’ deal that is Jean-Clair Todibo.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "7) Brighton – £41.5m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "6) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £58.5m\nThey have dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Welcome to the big time, Xabi Alonso.",
      "",
      "4) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "1) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will cost more on his own."

      "Updating everyone on Gyokeres’ situation, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said on his YouTube channel earlier this week: “Gyokeres was and remains an option for Arsenal in terms of new striker. Because at the moment my information is Arsenal are advancing on the deal for Benjamin Sesko.",

      "“At the moment Sesko remains the favourite, Viktor Gyokeres remains the other option on the table, but as it’s now two or three weeks that Arsenal are still not advancing on the Gyokeres deal, all the other clubs keep calling his agents.",
      "“That’s what happened in the last 48 hours over the weekend. From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",

      "Their initial showed Arsenal ‘willing to pay a fixed amount below 60 million euros (something around 55 million euros), but which, with bonuses for objectives, could reach close to 65 million euros’.",
      "After the ‘urgent request’ by Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, it is claimed that ‘there has been growing optimism among the Swedish international’s representatives regarding a positive outcome’.",

      "It’s a phenomenal achievement for a club of Brentford’s size and it’s a credit to them and Frank in particular, that it would feel weird not to have them in the Premier League with their feet firmly under the top-flight table.",
      "Frank’s move to Tottenham for a supposed upward career move could raise their relegation fears, but the ever-increasing gap to the Championship should cushion their likely decline next season as Leeds United and co. face an uphill battle to buck a disheartening trend.",
      "Brentford’s situation would become more problematic if several key stars follow Frank in leaving this summer, though. With that, we have decided to prepare their supporters for this worst-case scenario (you’re welcome, by the way) by reassigning five Bees standouts to rival Premier League clubs…",

      "Bukayo Saka has emphatically left Gabriel Martinelli in the dirt, with their respective development heading in opposite directions as the stagnated Brazil international’s uninspiring form has fuelled their interest in potential upgrades, including one ‘dream target’.",
      "With a large chunk of Arsenal’s summer budget likely to be spent on a striker, they may not have the financial muscle to splash out on a direct upgrade on Martinelli and if they decide to pursue an affordable option to compete with, rather than replace, the Gunners star, Schade would not be a bad shout.",
      "The 23-year-old, valued at £25m on transfermarkt amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund, enjoyed a breakout season in 2024/25 and was a consistent provider of goal involvements, with his final total of 13 in 38 games a more-than-respectable tally.",

      "It has not helped that the squad inherited by Amorim was not suited to his 3-4-3 system, but their dire Premier League form ensured they were shot of confidence and the lack of creativity in the side was laid bare as they struggled to forge enough openings at goal.",
      "The Red Devils seemingly have two irons in the fire for a new No.9, while significantly more progress has been made in their overhaul of the No.10 department, with £65m-rated Mbeumo set to follow Matheus Cunha in joining United for four reasons.",
      "This is somewhat surprising given how shambolic United were in the 2024/25 season, but the grandeur of the club is  still enough to lure key targets to their “graveyard”.

      "In previous seasons, Wissa has mostly been used as a winger, but circumstances meant he had to operate as a No.9 in 2024/25 and he seamlessly adapted to this role and is attracting interest from elsewhere.",
      "The age factor is against the 28-year-old as clubs eye targets with a longer shelf life, but Forest plotted an ambitious move in January and their chances of landing him have increased since securing European football.

      "Their much-needed Europa League triumph was not enough to save Ange Postecoglou, but it provides Frank and their recruitment team with a strong platform to build with Champions League football delivering a huge injection of funds.",
      "You have to fancy Frank to steady the ship at Spurs with a more flexible approach than Postecoglou, while his philosophy is front-foot enough to align with the Spurs way.",

      "The 24-year-old arrived in the Premier League with plenty of promise but fell short of expectations in his first two years, though he is coming off a standout campaign as he reached double figures for assists in the Premier League and could be another regen of fellow Dane Christian Eriksen.",

      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from Nottingham Forest. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",
      "",
      "9) Alan Varela (Porto)\nVarela is only 23 but still uncapped for Argentina, which is mildly baffling. He’s quietly become one of the best defensive midfielders in Portugal, and we expected more concrete interest from the continent by now.",
      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked at one juncture, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract just weeks ago.",
      "That alone makes him the least likely on this list to actually move this summer.",
      "",
      "8) Thomas Partey (Arsenal)\nPotentially available on a free transfer, Partey is in talks to extend his Arsenal contract. If he does leave, he could be the bargain of the window.",
      "This was the first season since joining Arsenal that Partey has managed to stay fit throughout, which is typical in a contract year. Had his deal expired any other summer, Mikel Arteta would probably have let him walk.",
      "Not only was Partey reliable for once, he also played extremely well, and quietly became one of Arsenal’s most important players.",

      "",
      "7) Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich)\nOne of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League during his Fulham days, it just hasn’t happened for Palhinha at Bayern. He earned a deserved move last summer, but could be out the door again after just one season.",
      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign.

      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 25, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",

      "5) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",

      "They won’t have him in time for the tournament and struggled to convince top targets before the first summer deadline, so he’s high on their list. The 25-year-old often emerges as a Plan B for clubs chasing midfielders; Manchester City had him on standby if Tijjani Reijnders didn’t move, while United and Liverpool have been linked over the past year.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘opened new talks’ to sign Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta and the deal hinges on two factors.",
      "Man Utd are wasting no time in the transfer market this summer and their current priority is to overhaul their attack after they were toothless in forward areas in 2024/25.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, Matheus Cunha commented on his move to Old Trafford after they paid around £62.5m to sign him from Wolves.",
      "Cunha said: “It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player.",
      "“Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.",
      "“I can’t wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my team-mates and prepare for the season ahead. All my focus is now on working hard to become a valuable part of the team, and helping get this club back to the top.”",
      "Cunha is expected to be joined by Bryan Mbeumo at Man Utd, who are also in the market for a new striker as they need an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "READ: Spend now, sell later? Man Utd could be stuck with bloated bomb squad",
      "Liam Delap initially looked likely to join the Red Devils, but he eventually opted to sign for Chelsea as Man Utd have been forced to consider alternatives.",
      "Man Utd are also known to be admirers of Viktor Gyokeres, who worked with Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Gyokeres would be another statement signing, but they face competition in the race to sign the 54-goal striker, who is a contender to be this year’s top scorer in Europe.",
      "Mateta is also a potential target after he shone for FA Cup winners Crystal Palace during the 2024/25 campaign, with reports suggesting he could cost around £40m this summer.",
      "A report from Football Insider claims Man Utd have ‘opened new talks’ to sign Mateta, whose long-term future is in doubt as his contract expires in 2027.",
      "Former Premier League scout Mick Brown – who remains well-connected at his former clubs – claims the striker, who is ‘crucial’ for Crystal Palace, but the door would open to a move to Old Trafford if the Eagles and the forward cannot agree terms and should the Red Devils miss out on other options.",
      "Brown explained: “Crystal Palace are talking to Mateta about signing a new contract.",
      "“At the moment, it’s definitely more likely he’ll stay at Palace rather than going anywhere else.",
      "“He’s a big player for them and a big part of the manager’s plans to keep building his squad.",
      "“He is one Man United have been looking at, one of a few I might add, and I’m sure they’ll be keeping a close eye on the situation there.",
      "“They have other targets who I expect they’ll put ahead of Mateta, but if they can’t get somebody else over the line, he has been spoken about.",
      "“If for whatever reason Palace can’t agree a deal, it might give United the chance to make a move.“",

This deal, if finalised, would have an immediate impact on the pursuit of Marcus Rashford, whose signing would lose momentum in the Camp Nou offices.’",

The goalkeeper’s most recent appearance for the Three Lions had come during his time at West Brom, but when he replaced Joe Hart at half-time of a 1-0 win over Sweden, he was plying his trade in Turkey with Bursaspor. Jack Rodwell and Bobby Zamora also featured in a game settled by a deflected Gareth Barry header, which feels remarkably fitting.",

      "Al-Ahli (1)",
      "We thought he might have played his last game for England when he left Brentford for Saudi Arabia, but the unavailability of Ollie Watkins, Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden meant a return to the fold/bench, where he was ‘fuming’ to be only given a few minutes at the end of a 3-1 friendly defeat to Senegal.",

      "After seven years of dividing opinions between England fans – was he quite obviously the best right-back of his generation, an option in midfield or a defensive liability that should be shunted from the squad? – as a Liverpool player, Trent became the sixth Real Madrid player to represent England when he come off the bench in a 1-0 win over Andorra.",

He later moved to Sporting Gijon, Marseille, Charleroi and Rayo Vallecano (twice) before his untimely passing in 1989, but never again came onto the Three Lions radar.",

      "One year with Highley Miners Welfare, two apiece at Kidderminster Harriers and Cardiff and four years as a striker at Aston Villa persuaded the oft-ignored Gerry Hitchens to move further afield for his opportunities. And to be fair to him, more than half his caps came after he left England behind for Italy. He was actually the first player to be capped for England while playing abroad, and the first to go to a major tournament (the 1962 World Cup) while playing for a foreign team.",

This is the David Watson of relative journeymanship, who ended up at Werder Bremen in 1979 after spells with Notts County, Rotherham, Sunderland and Manchester City. His red card and subsequent eight-week ban in his second Werder game – as well as an early return to England – meant he played more often for his country (four times) than his club (twice) while in Germany.",

      "Roma (5)",
      "In that eternal race to live off a cameo minute every other game when Kane is given a rest by being substituted late on, Abraham really staked his claim in a 27-goal debut season with Roma.

After his particular brand of Fronting Up reached a crescendo at Euro 2016, Hart was bombed out of the Manchester City starting line-up by Pep Guardiola but held on to his England shirt for a while, including during that weird loan in Italy where his name was listed as ‘John’ on a team sheet that one time, despite his actual name being neither that nor Joe, but instead Charles. Fair play. No chance you get away with calling yourself ‘Hartdog’ if your name is Charles.",

During his sole season in Spain, he retained his England place and duly netted six times in 11 matches. That included a hat-trick in a win over Colombia in May 2005 – six days after former club Liverpool had lifted the Champions League.",

He earned more caps in three years at Rangers (22) than in four with Tottenham (20), as well as 12 at Lazio and three with Middlesbrough. He was sadly never even called up while at Chinese second-tier side Gansu Tianma, despite boasting a record of two goals in four games.",

Woodcock, then coming to the end of his first spell at FC Koln, was truly the odd one out.",

      "Inter Milan (17)",
      "Ince had just barely left Serie A by the time his most memorable and blood-soaked England performance came against Italy in October 1997. But the midfielder was in the midst of his Italian job during Euro ’96, where he was supposedly the designated sixth penalty taker in that semi-final shoot-out.",

      "Sampdoria (17)",
      "Paul Gascoigne emerged from the 1990 World Cup as a global superstar, but he was not the only England player to impress sufficiently to earn a move to Italy. In the same summer Gazza left Tottenham for Lazio, Walker departed his Nottingham Forest home to try his luck at Sampdoria. His time in Serie A was not quite so memorable, with Sven-Goran Eriksson playing him out of position at right-back in his only year outside of England, but he did keep his international place.",

      "",
      "12) Kieran Trippier – 19 caps (of 42)",
      "Atletico Madrid (19)",
      "Two-and-a-half seasons of learning under the cojones of Simeone did absolutely nothing whatsoever to impact the England prospects of Trippier; it might even have strengthened them, considering it was somewhere around the defender’s move to Spain when Gareth Southgate decided that yeah, this man is also a left-back. It does not feel like a coincidence that he retired from international football straight after the manager resigned.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – 22 caps (of 23)",
      "Borussia Dortmund (22)",
      "That says plenty about his brilliance in Germany. It also says absolutely loads about how things have gone in England.",
      "",
      "10) Trevor Francis – 22 caps (of 52)",
      "Detroit Express (2), Sampdoria (20)",
      "Most will know that many of Francis’ England caps came during his spell in Sampdoria, but he also earned a couple of call-ups while on a weird kind of loan with NASL side Detroit Express. He headed to America at the end of the 1977/78 season with Birmingham, returned to become the first £1m footballer with Nottingham Forest in February 1979, then went back to Detroit that summer, never fully losing his grip on an England place.",

      "9) Ray Wilkins – 22 caps (of 84)",
      "AC Milan (22)",
      "Far from damaging his England prospects, Wilkins found that his candle shone brighter away from the spotlight. He made nine and ten international appearances in 1985 and 1986 respectively – his two full calendar years in Italy. Only in 1982 (12) did he play more often for his country.",

Much like James Rodriguez earned a move to Real Madrid with his exploits in 2014, Spain’s other giant saw fit to bring in Gary Lineker in 1986. He played 24 of a possible 25 England games as a Barcelona player, scoring 17 goals.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "Heading into the 2024/25 campaign, Onana‘s position at Man Utd was pretty secure as he grew into his debut season at Old Trafford after replacing David De Gea.",
      "However, Onana’s situation has drastically changed over the past year as his performances declined during the 24/25 season as he made several unforgivable mistakes.",
      "This summer is vital for Man Utd as they need to build a squad equipped to thrive under Ruben Amorim in his 3-4-3 formation and their priority has been to strengthen in forward positions.",
      "The Red Devils have already signed Matheus Cunha and he is expected to be joined by Bryan Mbuemo while they remain in the market for a new striker.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye Isak alternative, City to spoil Arsenal plan",

      "Man Utd have been linked with several potential targets and a report from Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport claims two goalkeepers are on their radar amid an ‘open situation’.",
      "Nice’s Marcin Bułka is ‘one name on United’s list’, while Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez is also ‘on their radar’, as they ‘determine whether to go for a number one’.",
      "Jacobs also claims Man Utd have ‘entered talks’ for Bulka, but they cannot sign him during this summer’s transfer window.",
      "The report notes that ‘United and Nice are still banned from doing summer business until September after the latter was placed in a blind trust, allowing both clubs to compete in the Europa League in 2024/25’ as they avoided a breach of UEFA’s multi-club ownership rules amid Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s involvement.",
      "Therefore, ‘should a deal progress, United will attempt to agree on something for January 2026, or even wait until Bulka becomes a free agent next summer’.",
      "Bulka’s current contract is due to expire in June 2026, with ‘the Red Devils and additional suitors sniffing an opportunity to pounce for a cut-price fee when the transfer window reopens on June 16’.",
      "Regarding Onana and Martinez, the report adds:",
      "‘Onana went on holiday focused on Manchester United as he has not been warned that he is for sale or at risk of losing his regular starting berth, GMS sources understand, but influential figures are assessing the market and will communicate their decision to him after the initial plan was to bring in a replacement for Altay Bayindir ahead of his expected exit.",
      "‘GMS sources recently revealed that Aston Villa fan favourite Emiliano Martinez has been on the Red Devils’ radar, alongside La Liga heavyweights Atletico Madrid, and the World Cup winner’s preference is thought to be to stay in Europe even though he has options to embark on a fresh challenge in Saudi Arabia.’",

      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Friday 13 June 2025 12:16, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",

      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 15:13, UK",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",

      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",

      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo; Man Utd also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward; he is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford",
      "Monday 9 June 2025 18:40, UK",
      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Manchester United also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward despite having a bid rejected for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo - a player also on the list at Spurs.",
      "Mbeumo appears to be United's priority target after a £55m offer was rejected by Brentford last week - and they are expected to follow up with another offer.",
      "There have been reports that Thomas Frank wants Spurs to sign Mbeumo if he becomes their new head coach - but it is ultimately Spurs as a club that decide who they sign.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Johan Lange call the recruitment shots, with the returning Fabio Paratici also having a say - so a Frank arrival would not necessarily make a move for Mbeumo inevitable.",
      "He is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It means both Semenyo and Mbeumo's futures remain in the balance as Frank nears the head coach role at Tottenham - an event that may prove pivotal in the outcome for both men.",
      "Tottenham have opened talks with Brentford for Thomas Frank.",
      "Discussions between the clubs over compensation are under way. Spurs have no second or third-choice options. Frank is and has been the No 1 target for board members.",
      "Frank is interested in taking the job and wants to speak to Spurs. Although Brentford do not wish to stand in his way if he wants to move to a bigger club, they do not plan to let him go on the cheap.",
      "Brentford are prepared to listen to offers from Spurs but expect them to be serious ones.",
      "Frank has a release clause in his contract, which has two years left to run. It is widely being reported to be in the region of £10m.",
