      "Liverpool have set the early pace in the transfer market after completing deals for Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Armin Pecsi and there's little sign they're slowing down. Wirtz's arrival is the big move of the summer thus far with the Reds requiring to pay up to £116million with add-ons.",
      "Milos Kerkez is next expected through the door, with a medical scheduled for during the week. Liverpool have agreed a £40m fee with Bournemouth and personal terms are already agreed.",
      "And a striker is still on the agenda. While Alexander Isak is appreciated, prising him away from Newcastle will prove difficult after the Magpies claimed Champions League football.",
      "But with Darwin Nunez set to depart, a forward is likely to be on Arne Slot's list. A number of other exits could await too as Andy Robertson, Harvey Elliott and Federico Chiesa all consider their futures.",
      "Italian outlet Tutto Mercato Web claim Liverpool have made a proposal to Napoli to sign Victor Osimhen. The Serie A champions are keen to offload the Nigeria international, who spent last term on loan at Galatasaray.",
      "Osimhen has been linked with Manchester United already this summer as they target a new striker, and the forward is said to have snubbed a move to Al-Hilal. Liverpool are hoping to tempt Napoli into a deal by offering up Darwin Nunez and Federcio Chiesa in exchange for the 26-year-old",
      "Darwin is expected to leave Anfield this summer after a tough season. Chiesa meanwhile has been told by new Italy boss Gennaro Gattuso that he must play more frequently to be part of his plans with the national team.",
      "Napoli have made Darwin Nunez their primary target up front this summer and will not advance negotiations over other options until they know whether making a deal with Liverpool is feasible, per reports.",
      "The Italian side are set to continue talks with the Reds next week having already made a verbal offer in the region of €40m (34m). That would see the club make a significant loss on the Uruguay international who signed for more than £85m.",
      "Lorenzo Lucca and Rasmus Hojlund have been touted as alternatives but Darwin is Antonio Conte's favoured option for the moment. Liverpool are said to want £43m for the striker.",
      "Marc Guehi is only willing to leave Crystal Palace if he is assured of being a regular first-team starter, per reports. The defender has long been admired by Liverpool, and has drawn interest from the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle.",
      "The Eagles star is in the final year of his contract but Palace still want a £40m fee. The Reds do not want to overpay for Guehi, but with the sale of Jarell Quansah and uncertainty over Ibrahima Konate, speculation is sure to continue.",

      "United's lack of European football doesn't seem as if it will halt their recruitment. A willingness to sell nearly every player in their squad is also set to aid their transfer budget.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-3 system didn't lend itself to the players the Portuguese boss inherited in Manchester and several key positions need addressing. That is before the man in the dugout decides whether those on his books have what it takes to make the club a winning outfit once more.",
      "Cunha is set to play in one of the two roles that sit behind the frontman. Who that will be still needs to be determined. Viktor Gyokeres has flirted with a move but doesn't seem to be keen at present. It is clear that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee aren't what the team need currently.",
      "United's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo is well documented. Brentford have rejected their opening offers with Tottenham, who now have Thomas Frank at the helm, hoping they can swoop in and seal a move for the Cameroonian. He's just enjoyed the best year of his career and is tipped to move on, but still favours a switch to Manchester.",
      "He, like Cunha, would likely thrive in one of the positions behind the frontman. Equally though Bruno Fernandes, the club's talisman, has occupied one of those roles but may drop deeper to accommodate all the attacking talent that could be arriving in Manchester.",
      "With Gyokeres favouring other destinations Amorim's search for and out and out striker continues. Scoring goals was a well documented problem for the Red Devils and, after also missing out on Delap, Victor Osimhen could now come into play. The Nigerian's time in Napoli is up.",
      "He was pushed out of loan last term, scoring regularly at Galatasaray, and he's turned down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia which underlines his desire to remain in Europe. Osimhen has just 12 months left on his deal meaning he could be available for less than his market value.",
      "At the other end of the pitch Andre Onana is still yet to convince despite having two years in between the sticks. He has continued to come up with errors and was even dropped by Amorim last term. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez is a man who is linked with pastures new.",
      "He appeared to say his goodbyes and cut an emotional figure on his last outing at Villa Park. Rumours have mounted that United are keen, and their interest is reciprocated by the Argentina No 1 himself whilst Monaco are understood to be keen on Onana.",
      "In front of the goalkeeper, despite potentially wanting to bolster his defensive line, Amorim may have to stick with what he's got. United ultimately don't have a bottomless pit of cash and if they landed Cunha, Mbeumo, Osimhen and Martinez it would take them beyond the £200m mark.",
      "Those signings could yet be aided by some significant departures with Alejandro Garnacho being among the most significant. Previously cited as a player for the long haul, he has since fallen down the pecking order and his attitude was called into question following his snub in the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd's possible XI: Martinez; Yoro, Maguire, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dalot; Cunha, Mbeumo, Osimhen.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot is making up for lost time this summer after opening the transfer floodgates at Anfield. And it has taken the Dutchman just a few weeks to break the rule predecessor Jurgen Klopp sought to adhere to above all others in the market.",
      "Klopp, 58, previously made a point of stressing his morals when it came to keeping Liverpool financially solvent. And that meant not necessarily spending on a par with the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United, who copped criticism from the former Reds boss for their free-spending ways in the past.",
      "Of course that changed over time as Liverpool made allowances in opening their chequebook so Klopp could compete. But the German was staunchly against spending £100million fees on individuals when he first arrived at Anfield – a line Liverpool have now crossed with the blockbuster signing of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a British record deal worth up to £116m, with £100m of that being guaranteed.",
      "\"If you bring one player in for £100m or whatever and he gets injured then it all goes through the chimney,\" Klopp warned back in 2016 after United forked out £89m to re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. \"The day that this is football, I’m not in a job any more, because the game is about playing together.",
      "\"That is why somebody invented passes so these players can play together. It’s not about running with the ball because you can do it all the time. Building the group is not my unique idea – it is necessary to be successful in football.",
      "\"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players, yes. Do I have to do it differently to that? I don’t know exactly how much money we could spend because nobody has told me up to this point, ‘No, no, no you can’t do this.’",
      "\"If I spend money it is because I am trying to build a real team. You can win championships, you can win titles. But maybe there is a manner in which you want it. It is about how it is.\"",
      "The Merseysiders have added 22-year-old Wirtz to their armoury and could have to shell out as much as £116m if certain conditions are met. And that addition means Liverpool have now spent more money in this window than any other in their history to date.",
      "Slot recruited Jeremie Frimpong (also from Leverkusen) for £29.5m earlier in the summer, while goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has joined from Valencia for an initial £25m, along with £4m in add-ons – with that deal agreed last summer counting towards their 2025 spending. Not only that, but a £40m move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez is also in the pipeline.",
      "Provided the Kerkez deal goes through as expected, that would take Liverpool's total spend this summer to roughly £215m (providing all bonus clauses are met). And despite the fact the transfer window has been open for less than one month, that would far eclipse the previous record for total spend in any other window.",
      "The closest Klopp came to matching that sum was in the summer of 2018 when he spent around £170m on new signings. That included Alisson from Roma (£65m), Naby Keita from RB Leipzig (£53m), Fabinho from Monaco (£39m) and Xherdan Shaqiri from Stoke (£13.5m), though the investments paid off as they won the Champions League that season.",
      "Eventually, Klopp wasn't too far from overseeing a couple of nine-digit deals himself, considering Liverpool signed Virgil van DIjk and Darwin Nunez for £75m and £85m, respectively. Van Dijk became the most expensive defender in football history at the time of his move from Southampton, and Klopp later walked back his comments concerning exorbitant transfer fees.",
      "\"These kind of things happen. When you want to sign a striker as exciting as Darwin is, that’s the market and you have to pay the price,\" he conceded in 2023. \"I said so many things in my life and life caught me then later and showed me that my imagination was obviously not clear enough for how quickly life can change. That’s how it is.",
      "\"After that [comment about Pogba], we bought a centre-half for quite a decent fee [£75m for Van Dijk], we bought a goalie for quite a decent fee [Alisson]. Our situation is always the same, we try to level it somehow [with sales], the things we invest in the boys and in the players we sell, it’s kind of that it’s not going out of any kind of range and that worked so far, but I know, I heard it immediately.\"",
      "To Slot's credit, he won the Premier League in his debut campaign despite barely spending at all last summer. It's only fair that one, therefore, takes into account that spread of cost, which brings his net spend to a more modest £100m or so per summer window so far."

They are also understood to be targeting Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo and Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres, but the failure to complete such deals has left Amorim frustrated.",
      "But ex-United goalkeeper Ben Foster believes there is still hope after suggesting that bringing in a player of Martinez's quality would encourage others to follow.",
      "The former Watford and Wrexham shot-stopper expressed his view despite suggesting United are unlikely to challenge at the top of the table next season.",
      "\"That's a good move for Man United and it's going to be a massive miss [for Aston Villa] ,\" Foster said on his 'Fozcast' podcast. \"If they do sign him, I think it enables United to go and flex their muscles and get a couple more big boys.",
      "\"Mbeumo has already been spoken about and Cunha is already through the door. But I don't think they are going to be anywhere near challenging. Even the top ten is going to be a struggle this season for them.\"",
      "When asked what would motivate Martinez to leave Villa, who finished sixth in the table, he added: \"What Man United have got ahead of others is global appeal.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "\"If he signs for Manchester United, everything just gets bumped and his wages are going to go up. He's definitely going somewhere, because nobody cries on the pitch at the end of the season otherwise.\"",
      "Any move for Martinez is likely to see him replace Andre Onana as United's first-choice goalkeeper. Onana has made a series of errors since joining the club and has recently spoken out about rumours surrounding his future, telling Afrik-Foot: \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see.\"",
      "Martinez currently has four years remaining on the five-year contract he signed with Villa in 2024. If he does join United, he could find at least two familiar faces at Old Trafford in international teammates Lisandro Martinez and Alejandro Garnacho."

      "The relationship between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo has been the source of feverish speculation for years. The duo, often regarded as the two best players of all time, honed their intense rivalry in La Liga with Messi starring for Barcelona and Ronaldo for Real Madrid.",
      "While fans are eager to know if the pair are pals, the Argentinian World Cup winner has now opened up on where he stands with his Portuguese rival. Messi, 37, is still causing waves on the world's stage for Inter Miami, while Ronaldo, 40, now plays for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Messi gave a timely reminder of his genius on Thursday, giving Miami their first win the Club World Cup with a breathtaking free-kick against FC Porto.",
      "Afterwards, he discussed his long-term adversary Ronaldo, claiming that they are not actually friends. However, he explained that's only the case as the pair barely get a chance to cross paths.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect and admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo and for the career he's had and continues to have, because he's still competing at the highest level,\" Messi told DSports.",
      "\"The competition with him was on the pitch. Each of us wanted to do the best for our team. Obviously, as always, everything stayed on the field. Off the pitch, we are two normal people. We're not friends obviously because we don't spend time together, but we've always treated each other with a lot of respect.\"",
      "His comments echo his take on the relationship that he made eight years ago. Messi told Spanish outlet Marca in 2017: \"I don't know if we will be [friends]. Friendship is built through spending time together and getting to know each other.",
      "\"We have no relationship, mainly because we only see each other at awards ceremonies and that's the only time we speak. Everything is fine, but our lives don't cross over very often.\"",
      "Does Ronaldo feel the same way? In an interview with Spanish outlet El Chiringuito earlier this year, the ex-Manchester United star claimed he is on good terms with the Miami star due their 'healthy' rivalry – although he has distanced himself from having a friendship with Messi in the recent past.",
      "\"I have a good relationship with Leo Messi,\" said Ronaldo this year. \"I was translating him in English at an award ceremony too! It was funny. It was a healthy rivalry, we got along.\"",
      "However, speaking in 2023, Ronaldo explained: \"I don't see things like that [as a rivalry], the rivalry is gone. It was good, spectators liked it.",
      "\"Those who like Cristiano Ronaldo don't have to hate Messi and vice versa. He's followed his path, and I have followed mine, regardless of playing outside of Europe.",
      "\"The legacy lives on, but I don't see the rivalry like that. We shared the stage many times, it was 15 years. I'm not saying we're friends, I've never had dinner with him, but we're professional colleagues and we respect each other.\"",
      "While the constant debate of just who is the better player, as well as their La Liga battles, have spurred on the question of whether the two are friends - there is another point of contention between the pair: the Ballon d'Or.",
      "Messi has been crowned the winner of the prestigious award eight times, while Ronaldo is his closest challenger on five, which has caused some friction. Yet it seems the iconic duo, while not likely to be spotted dining together any time soon, have put their famous rivalry to one side, for now."

      "Marcus Rashford might only have one Manchester United exit option left after already ruling out three Premier League rivals. The Red Devils academy graduate is fully expected to leave Old Trafford this summer after an explosive season.",
      "He was axed from the squad entirely by Ruben Amorim before joining Aston Villa on loan. Villa had a £40m option to make the deal permanent but despite his promising displays in the Midlands, they chose not to re-sign him.",
      "It is suggested that Rashford has already turned down moves to both Saudi Arabia and Turkey. He is open to a rival Premier League side but he does not want to move to London, which would see the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham all out of the race for his services.",
      "It is further detailed that United chiefs expect Rashford to move abroad having put a move to Barcelona at the top of his list. The Catalan giants have an interest in Rashford but are currently attempting to thrash out a deal for Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams which will stretch their finances.",
      "A loan move now looks to be the only route out of Old Trafford for Rashford this summer. And he will hope to get his future sorted soon after Ruben Amorim made his feelings about a reintegration into the squad very clear.",
      "The United boss banished the forward alongside three colleagues from the club’s pre-season tour alongside Antony, Alejando Garnacho and Jadon Sancho. Explaining Rashford’s initial omission back in February, Amorim said: \"What I say is I couldn't put Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it.",
      "\"And sometimes you have one player who is really good with one coach and the same player with another coach is different. I just wish the best to Rashford and Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",
      "He added: \"The case was some of the guys don't adapt the way I see football, the other guys adapt, and we are trying to build the team. It's something that you feel, as a coach and a player.",

      "Signing the best player from Wolves should never be billed as a 'statement signing' by Manchester United but there was a statement of intent with the quick conclusion of the Matheus Cunha deal.",
      "Cunha's release clause, the Portuguese coterie at United and Ruben Amorim's system made the Brazilian playmaker an obviously attractive target. After Wolves won at Old Trafford on Easter Sunday, the swiftness with which United moved for Cunha meant it would have been a surprise if he had not ended up in their shirt.",
      "Buying Premier League quality also laid down a marker. After the world record £80million United parted with to buy Harry Maguire in 2019, they bought one player from a Premier League side (Mason Mount) before this calendar year.",
      "Cunha is a specialist No.10 and an upgrade on United's existing options, bar Bruno Fernandes. Fernandes could be relocated to central midfield if he remains at United beyond the closure of the transfer window.",
      "Sources at United spoke about the desire to come out of the blocks in the window. Ideally, they would have two new forwards in the building but Liam Delap chose Chelsea. Minutes after Delap's decision had been reported, United staff in Hong Kong were in a relaxed mood and stressing there were contingency targets.",
      "United's season, with 44 league goals and a -10 goal difference, demanded swift action in the market. Now their priority is Bryan Mbeumo, another forward who outscored Cunha with a remarkable 20 league goals last term.",
      "Mbeumo represents the best of both worlds. He can switch from attacker to defender, given his experience on the right wing in Brentford's back-three system. His natural skill set is of an attacker, though. Mbeumo was amused to discover he was listed as a midfielder in the Fantasy Premier League last season.",
      "The looming 'deadline' of June 30 - the end of the financial year - and the rejection of United's opening offer of up to £55m for Mbeumo has caused activity to slow down. Deals were practically done for Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro in early July last year and there is bound to be movement next month.",
      "United leave for their pre-season tour of the United States on July 22 - four weeks on Tuesday. Before that, their friendly schedule begins against Leeds United in Norway (again) on July 19. United are still guarded as to the official return date for their players but the week beginning July 7 would be logical (it was July 8 last year).",
      "In previous summers, United have finalised signings after the start of the pre-season tour only to welcome new players at their base. Sergio Romero, Fred and Andre Onana flew to the United States in 2015, 2018 and 2023. United decided not to summon Christian Eriksen to Australia in 2022.",
      "This summer is a rarity in that there is no international tournament. After the 2026 World Cup, another Africa Cup of Nations is scheduled for summer 2027, then is the European Championship and the Copa America in 2028.",
      "Having Cunha and Mbeumo in Chicago would be another statement."

      "The wall of the Manchester United academy gym at Carrington may be in need of a revamp. It is adorned by Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Tom Heaton is also on it. At the time of the interior decoration, all four were United first team squad members. Three still are, technically, but Heaton is likely to be the only one remaining come the end of summer.",
      "In the main building, there are young and old images of past graduates. Dean Henderson is one of the most recent, a success story for the United academy but not at United.",
      "United's outgoing academy director Nick Cox celebrated Henderson's man-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final on X. Henderson was, briefly, United's first homegrown No.1 since Gary Walsh. The chances of an academy talent making the grade at United are more remote than for those in any other position.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "£85",
      "Cox always accepted goalkeepers were a conundrum. Enough were needed to play, train and cover the first team, so a minimum of six were needed in the junior teams. United relish emergency loan calls from clubs for goalkeepers as Henderson's first career appearance was as an emergency loanee at non-league Stockport County in 2016.",
      "The image of Henderson can still motivate the incumbent academy custodians. Henderson has won the FA Cup, will be playing in Europe next season and there are whispers he could supplant Jordan Pickford as the England No.1.",
      "\"We take great pride in seeing our boys have great careers away from here,\" Cox said. \"If we hinged everything on who crosses the white line (for United), we'd all be miserable.\"",
      "Cox's work at United is done and he will move to Everton as their technical director later this year. “Nick has made a huge contribution to Manchester United over the past nine years,\" United's director of football Jason Wilcox said. \"I was already well aware of his qualities before I arrived at the club and have really enjoyed working together.",
      "“Identifying and developing the best youth talent remains one of this club’s top priorities, and we are grateful for the work Nick has done to provide such a strong foundation for us to continue to build on.\"",
      "2019, the year that Henderson became a Premier League player with Sheffield United, coincided with Cox's appointment as head of the United academy. Nicky Butt assumed the role of head of first team development and both made invaluable contributions to reviving one of the most important sectors at United.",
      "In the years after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, the academy was neglected. Following Brian McClair's departure in 2015, there was no full-time academy head for a year. Instead, it was jointly run by the club secretary John Alexander and John Murtough, long before he assumed the prominent post of football director in 2021.",
      "United were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea, in the midst of monopolising the FA Youth Cup, in January 2016. Louis van Gaal watched Marcus Rashford from the stands at Altrincham a month before Rashford's stratospheric start to his professional career.",
      "That under 18 side also endured a 12-match losing run. Later that year, United's under 14s were annihilated 9-0 by Manchester City. There was uproar in Northern Ireland when United did not participate in the Milk Cup in 2015.",
      "The academy's reputation was buttressed at senior level by the breakthroughs of Rashford and Jesse Lingard, the 2016 FA Cup final matchwinner. Van Gaal handed debuts to 12 academy players, the majority of them undeserved or utterly unforeseen. Paddy McNair and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson had brief purple patches that gave the illusion the academy was in ship-shape.",
      "It wasn't until Butt returned to United to head the academy in February 2016. He oversaw an aggressive recruitment drive in the close season with Tahith Chong, Lee O'Connor, Nishan Burkart, Joshua Bohui and Millen Baars. None became United mainstays but a marker was laid down.",
      "After his promotion to the first team coaching staff by Jose Mourinho in 2018, some players found McKenna to be akin to a school teacher. His success at Ipswich Town is evidence that McKenna had the mettle to manage adults but his avuncular streak was apparent when he supported a nervous Gomes, aged 16, during a live televised interview with MUTV at the player of the year awards.",
      "Mourinho despaired at some of the players in the relegated under 21 side in 2018. \"Roshaun Williams, f*****g hell,\" he scoffed to a confidant. For Mourinho's final pre-season tour, Greenwood, Garner and Gomes were all included in the squad to usher in the more promising contingent.",
      "Cox ramped up United's overseas recruitment. Hannibal Mejbri cost £9m from Monaco in 2019, a year before United raided Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid for Marc Jurado, Alvaro Fernandez and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The European intake was never driven by Brexit, according to Cox. Jurado, Fernandez and Garnacho filled gaps at academy level to support the first team and all just happened to all be based in Spain, was his version of events.",
      "Fernandez is another United academy success story but one that got away from the first team. Garnacho's United career seems certain to end prematurely after five years yet he will be fondly remembered for his FA Youth Cup and FA Cup final winning goals.",
      "Cox coaxed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid to United via Zoom calls and the aid of an interpreter from his spare bedroom during lockdown in 2020. He wryly recalled his sons, aged 14 and 10 at the time, arguing outside over their X Box.",
      "Mark Dempsey, the academy coach brought back to United by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018, likened Garnacho to Peter Barnes, an old teammate during his fleeting playing career at United. Garnacho ended up ousting Rashford and has been bracketed with more celebrated United wingers.",
      "\"Only at 50 or 100 games can you start to think they might have cracked it,\" Cox once said. It could be 144 and out from Garnacho.",
      "Domestically, United bought Joe Hugill amid competition from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur in 2020. Charlie McNeill also made headlines as he defected from City for £750,000.",
      "United's academy fell behind City's for several years, which made the McNeill deal such a coup. McNeill started out at the United academy before he was lured to City in 2014. City offered to put McNeill's siblings in St Bede's College.",
      "More significantly in 2014, City opened the City Football Academy. United sources accept their own training complex at Carrington is no longer fit for purpose, though their new first team building is due to be finished later this summer.",
      "Darren Fletcher's sons, Jack and Tyler, spent nine years in the City academy before their homecoming at United in 2014. Both are youth internationals, one for England and one for Scotland. United considered City's simultaneous approach for Harrison Parker to be a \"revenge move\" after the deal for the Fletchers.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, born in a City stronghold in Stockport, is another graduate who United figures feel highlights the academy's revival. Those who know Mainoo believe he would have gone to City at youth level had United's academy not been overhauled by Butt and Cox.",
      "United's domestic recruitment has had to become more intense since Brexit regulations prevented English clubs from signing under- 8s from overseas. The Fletcher twins, Harry Amass and Chido Obi have all been involved with the first team. Toby Collyer and Ethan Ennis joined from Brighton and Liverpool in 2022. United include Ayden Heaven, a £1.5million signing from Arsenal's academy, among them.",
      "Cox was saddened by Brexit blocking United from assembling more multicultural squads. He felt United's ethos always had a blend of local lads and overseas recruits. The Youth Cup winners in 2022 had a Czech, a Norwegian and two Spaniards in the starting XI.",
      "Maxi Oyedele, born in Salford and now at Legia Warsaw, has already played for the Poland national side and is generating notable interest. Zach Baumann, from Bolton, has played for the Ukraine youth team.",
      "With a predominantly British squad, United secured a triple-crown success in 2023-24. The only blemish was on the night they froze in a surprising Youth Cup loss at Swindon Town.",
      "In February 2020, United reached the Youth Cup semi-finals for the first time in eight years. It was not a vintage squad and Mejbri, with 13 appearances, had the most first-team exposure. It nevertheless represented another progressive stride.",
      "A potent youth team underachieved in the competition the next year, losing 1-0 to Liverpool at Leigh Sports Village, before the glory in 2022. The final, staged at Old Trafford, set a new record for a Youth Cup attendance as 67,492 clicked through the turnstiles.",
      "Cox was never going to allow that triumph to define the academy. His role was so broad he restructured the coaching staff, rebuilt the sports science team, considered psychological support, redeveloped the performance analysis team and built a life skills programme.",
      "His responsibilities evolved significantly, segueing from effectively a dual-role with Butt. Cox also sensibly downplayed the presence of youngsters training with the first team, attempting to counter the hype and provide context for their temporary promotions.",
      "No, it did not mean they were primed to be the next superstar. It is often owed to first team injuries, recovery days or international commitments. It was different when Garnacho missed the Youth Cup final media day at the academy building as Ralf Rangnick deemed him worthy of senior squad status.",
      "Tyrell Warren was one of the first academy players to be namechecked by Mourinho after he took over at United. A former academy teammate of Rashford's, he is now at Grimsby Town in League Two yet the Mancunian remains a shining example of the United academy.",
      "Cox attended United's EFL Trophy match with Barrow in 2022, flanked by Tony Whelan, Dave Bushell and Eamon Mulvey, stalwarts of the United youth set-up. Darren Fletcher was also present at Holker Street.",
      "Before kick-off, Warren and Adam Temple, a former United academy coach, entered the boardroom for a catch-up. \"That's a classy Manchester United thing to do,\" Cox enthused. \"Because they've been brought up that way. In that they come to welcome us to talk about how their season's going. And you sit there and you go, 'that is youth development in a nutshell'.",
      "\"A young lad that's been through your programme that is absolutely maxing out, he has reached his full potential. He's earning a living in the game.\"",
      "Warren has since moved to Grimsby Town, seven places better off than Barrow last season. He had not hit a wall."

The 81 points United amassed in 2017-18 remain their most in a single campaign since the 2012-13 title win.",

After the Europa League group stage defeat to Fenerbahce at the start of November, United lost one of their next 28 matches - a League Cup semi-final second leg reverse at Hull City in which they still progressed to the final.",
      "Mourinho recalled Carrick for United's next game after Fenerbahce, a 3-1 victory away to Swansea City. In December and January, United embarked on a nine-game winning run and Carrick started in six as he was rested for the other three.",
      "Carrick was added to Mourinho's coaching staff after he retired from playing in May 2018 and he spent six months in the dugout before the Portuguese was sacked in December 2018.",
      "United beat Tottenham three times and Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City twice under Mourinho. They were unbeaten in four games against Liverpool until a 3-1 defeat in Mourinho's final match in charge at Anfield while there was a memorable 2-1 victory at Juventus in the Champions League a month earlier.",
      "“He was hungry to win,\" Carrick said of Mourinho, \"which is a pretty obvious thing to say. He was his own man and he knew how to win big games. That was his biggest asset.\"",

      "With Matheus Cunha already through the door, United are facing a crucial period over the next few weeks to sign more players. Bryan Mbeumo is a key target with the Brentford man seemingly set to decide on a move to Old Trafford or Tottenham.",
      "A move for a striker is expected to follow after the Mbeumo deal is wrapped up but there has been talk of United replacing Andre Onana in goal. AS Monaco have reportedly offered the United No.1 an escape route out of Manchester with Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez lined-up to replace him.",
      "In the past 24 hours, a number of updates have emerged regarding the future of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Rashford's dream move to Barcelona seems to be off with Nico Williams set to move to the Nou Camp while clubs in Italy are lining-up a move for Sancho.",
      "With this in mind, keep across all the latest United transfer news and updates below:",
      "Inter president Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed that the Italian club are keen on Parma striker Bonny despite their reported interest in Hojlund.",
      "Marotta told Sportmediaset:",
      "He is a player who is in our notebook, but we have not yet negotiated in depth. We will do it calmly. Parma's will remains to be seen, but I do not deny that they are interested.",
      "Como have reportedly enquired about the availability of Antony.",
      "The Mirror, however, claims he currently favours a return to Real Betis. They, though, reputedly want to do another loan, while United are said to be keen on a permanent departure, believing that now is the perfect time to cash in.",
      "Manchester United could finally be about to move ahead with their attempt to bolster Ruben Amorim's centre-forward options this summer.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves, United have been working to sign another attacker, with Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo close to becoming signing number two. There are also plans to add another option in the final third after United recorded their worst goalscoring season in 51 years.",
      "United finished the Premier League season with -10 goal difference, with Bruno Fernandes topping their scoring charts with 19. Centre-forwards Rasmus Hojlund (10) and Joshua Zirkzee (7) failed to hit the heights needed and expected of strikers to grace Old Trafford.",
      "Nottingham Forest are reportedly leading the race to sign Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "TEAMtalk claims they are currently the most concrete option. However, the Serbia international is said to be waiting for whether other Premier League clubs to intensify their interest, so United could come forward and still pursue the Juventus player.",
      "Inter potentially signing Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly getting complicated.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claims United want to sell the striker for around £40million. They are said to be against a loan that includes either an option or obligation for the Serie A side to make the move permanent. Inter's directors are reportedly working on the resistance they are encountering.",
      "United have reportedly rejected a request for information regarding Marcus Rashford, according to Corriere dello Sport.",
      "The losing Champions League finalists are one of several sides credited with an interest in the United player. Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus are also said to be among that group, alongside multiple Premier League clubs.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho reportedly wants a move within the Premier League this summer transfer window.",
      "GiveMeSport claims intermediaries have begun approaching United's rivals within the league to gauge interest levels league-wide. Garnacho is reputedly not committing to talks with overseas clubs such is his desire to remain in England, allegedly to the frustration of United.",
      "Their sources also suggest the club may have to halve their apparent £70million asking price. Dropping it to around £40million would purportedly improve chances of attracting interest.",
      "United have reputedly 'tried to establish whether there is a market for Mason Mount' this summer transfer window.",
      "The club's former chief scout, Mick Brown, has told Football Insider:",
      "Aston Villa have been spoken about, and I think they could make a move. People remember Mason Mount at his best; that's what Villa want to help him get back to, and it looks like he's back to full fitness now. His move to Man United hasn't been positive by any means, but he's still a talented player.",
      "Villa want to strengthen because they've lost Rashford and Asensio, so Mount is on their list. Unai Emery is a fan of his and feels he could help him to rediscover his Chelsea form. It would be an excellent move for Mount as well, because Villa are a top club, they've got top facilities, and they'll be playing in Europe.",
      "The one-time Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano has urged Moise Kean to stay at his former Fiorentina despite reported interest from United.",
      "Speaking on Radio Bruno [as relayed by FiorentinaNews.com] he said:",
      "I hope that the boy understands that Florence can still give him a lot: on more coveted stages, he has, in fact, shown that he has failed, and Fiorentina could be ideal for him for at least another year.",
      "It is true that, on a sporting level, Manchester United are not shining, but they are still one of the most important clubs in the history of football, with considerable economic power.",
      "Lately, everyone who has gone there has done badly, and I think it will be difficult for him to do worse than what his predecessors have already done.",
      "Marcus Rashford has admitted that he would like to play with Lamine Yamal someday amid reported transfer interest from Barcelona.",
      "He was asked in a video uploaded to YouTube on the xBuyer channel: \"Would you like to play with Lamine someday?",
      "Rashford replied:",
      "Yeah, for sure. Everybody wants to play with the best, y'know, so hopefully, we will see.",
      "Andre Onana is reputedly determined to remain a United player amid interest from Monaco.",
      "ESPN cites sources when claiming the goalkeeper is keen to stay and plans on returning to training next month for pre-season at Carrington. Ruben Amorim would reportedly have to tell Onana he is no longer needed to change that stance.",
      "AS Monaco seem to be looking to push ahead with their interest in Andre Onana with reports from The Times claiming they have approched the goalkeeper's representatives.",
      "The report states that the Ligue 1 side have asked the goalkeeper's camp to be kept updated on the situation. Onana is said to want to stay at Old Trafford to fight for his spot.",
      "Christian Falk has claimed that Man United target Joao Palhinha is keen to find out if Bayern Munich plan to use him this season.",
      "Reports have stated that United and Fulham are interested in bringing the Portugal international back to England. Speaking to CFBayern Insider, Falk said: \"Palhinha wants to talk with Kompany and Eberl, if he will have a chance for the next season.",
      "\"The club’s view is that they want to sell him. His prize tag will around £30m. Eberl returned to Europe from Bayern’s camp in the States to focus on transfers.”",
      "Marcus Rashford has initiated contact with Barcelona once again in hope of landing a move to the La Liga champions.",
      "Tot Costa of Catalunya Radio has claimed that Rashford's entourage have made fresh contract with Deco to reiterate his eagerness to join and willingness to remain patient over the transfer window.",
      "The report adds that Barca are open to signing Rashford, but only under the right conditions.",
      "Cesc Fabregas' Como have attempted to sign Antony this summer but the Brazilian's desire to return to Real Betis have delayed their pursuit.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Como want to bring the winger to the Serie A but Antony's preference is to return to Spain. Betis are said to be attempting every possible route to get a deal agreed with United.",
      "Man United are not ruling out a move for Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa this summer, according to reports in Portugal.",
      "Journalist Sebastiao Sousa-Pinto has reported that Costa is United's goalkeeping priority despite reports linking them with other targets. He wrote on X:",
      "\"As I have been reporting in recent weeks, Diogo Costa remains on Manchester United’s list to fill the goalkeeper position. The price tag could be an obstacle for the Red Devils. He has been Ruben Amorim’s favourite since January, but there are other options on the table if Onana leaves.”",
      "Jadon Sancho reportedly prefers a move to Napoli over Juventus this summer, according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio.",
      "It's claimed that Juventus have made a bid worth €25m for Sancho but the forward has agreed to join Scott McTominay in Naples. However, the Serie A champions are yet to submit an official bid.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic would become one of Man United's highest earners if he moves to the club this summer.",
      "GIVEMESPORT have claimed that the Juventus star is seeking a lucrative contract with a wage of around £200,000-per-week demanded.",
      "Vlahovic is set to reject a contract offer by Juve.",
      "More on Andre Onana here with Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio reporting that Atalanta's Marco Carnesecchi is among the list of replacements.",
      "Emi Martinez continues to be a strong candidate but Di Marzio has claimed that the Italian is admired by United.",
      "AS Monaco are reportedly exploring the possibility of offering Andre Onana an escape route out of Manchester United.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe have claimed that Monaco are looking to add a new shot-stopper to their squad to upgrade on their current options Radoslaw Madecki and Philipp Kohn.",
      "Chelsea's Djordje Petrovic is also on their radar.",
      "More from ESPN's report on Rashford and more clarity on what teams are interested in the United star has emerged.",
      "The story claims that Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, Bayern Munich and 'several' Premier League clubs are all interested in signing the forward.",
      "Marcus Rashford is planning to return to Man United training next month if a deal to leave the club isn't agreed, according to ESPN.",
      "A firm bid is yet to be received and as things stand, the 27-year-old will report back to Carrington. ESPN have reported that Ruben Amorim is yet to make a decision about whether Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho or Jadon Sancho will be part of his squad for the summer tour of the United States.",
      "Jadon Sancho is prepared to settle for a move to Italy after Chelsea decided not to buy him with Napoli reputedly keen on Sancho, having had a £40m bid rejected for fellow United winger Alejandro Garnacho in January.",
      "Sancho is out of contract at United next year and the club is seeking a fee similar to the one Chelsea originally agreed to pay, despite Sancho's underwhelming campaign in west London.",
      "United and Napoli have a productive relationship following the sale of Scott McTominay last summer and Napoli coach Antonio Conte has form for bringing players from the Premier League to Serie A.",
      "Manchester United are preparing for the possibility of sending Marcus Rashford out on loan for the entirety of next season.",
      "Rashford, 27, wants to join a Champions League club and has not entertained a potentially lucrative move to Saudi Arabia or Turkey and United sources believe there is a low possibility that a suitable bidder will come in for the £40million-rated forward.",
      "Inter Milan tentatively enquired about Rashford when they expressed interest in Rasmus Hojlund earlier this month but the Champions League finalists would only consider a loan deal.",
      "Antony is prepared to take a 30 per cent wage cut to leave Manchester United in this summer's transfer window, boosting Real Betis' chances of re-signing the winger.",
      "Spanish giants Real Madrid have been offered the chance to sign Marcus Rashford this summer, according to reports in Spain.",
      "Defensacentral report that United have approached Real Madrid over the possibility of signing Rashford. It is claimed that United are worried over Barcelona's interest, given their financial problems.",

      "Manchester United hero Gary Pallister has tipped Matheus Cunha to \"shake things up\" at the club.",
      "United signed Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million earlier this month after he scored 15 Premier League goals last season.",
      "Cunha, 26, is set to slot in as one of the two playmakers in coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, a set-up he regularly played in under Vitor Pereira at Wolves.",
      "Former Atletico Madrid forward Cunha is the first Brazilian to join United who has already played in the Premier League. During Pallister's five seasons with United in the Premier League era, Sir Alex Ferguson recruited top flight-proven quality in Eric Cantona, Roy Keane, Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham.",
      "Cunha received two separate suspensions last season for a fracas after Wolves lost to Ipswich Town and a red card away to Bournemouth. But Pallister, a member of United's first two double-winning teams in 1994 and 1996, believes the current United squad needs \"an edge\".",
      "\"I think it's big,\" Pallister said of United bringing in a signing with Premier League experience. \"I think you see a lot of foreign players coming in and I think that they’re taken aback with the pace and the physicality of the Premier League and it's not as physical as it used to be. So if you're already proven at that level in that environment, then I think it speaks volumes.",
      "\"I like Cunha because I know he's got an edge to him. I like that in a player. I think managers like that as long as you can try and keep a lid on it most of the time, I don't think that's a bad thing and a little bit of edginess is maybe what the dressing room needs as well, a little bit of personality, a little bit of character.",
      "\"Bryan Mbeumo, we know what he's like but I don't know what he's like as a character. He seems quite calm and calculated but for Brentford he has been a real threat.",
      "\"I like seeing a bit of an edge, I think, in terms of real leaders in the squad at Manchester United, I'm not sure there's too many who've got that Roy Keane, Paul Ince, Steve Bruce, Bryan Robson edge. I like seeing somebody going in there to shake things up a little bit.\"",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha both scored against United in defeats inflicted by Brentford and Wolves. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo were both booked for fouling Cunha in the Boxing Day loss at Molineux and Pallister duelled with a number of future teammates during his playing career.",
      "Ferguson consulted Pallister and his defensive partner Bruce on Cantona two-and-a-half months before his surprising move from Leeds United in November 1992. Keane came up against United a number of times with Nottingham Forest and made an impression on the squad.",
      "\"I remember back in the day after we won the title in '93, the first Premier League title,\" Pallister recalled. \"I remember sitting in the back of the bus one day and he was chatting amongst probably half a dozen or eight of us in the back of the bus before we went back after a game and I think we'd already won the title. It might have been the Wimbledon game after we won the title.",
      "\"And he was saying on the bus if you could sign one player for next season, who would it be? And he was going around us individually and I think everybody said Roy Keane.",
      "\"That year, he had kicked everybody, and we played him in the League Cup final (in 1992) and he had a fight with every player on the pitch that day. But we loved that edge about him, he was that up for the fight. But he could play as well.",
      "\"I remember (Ferguson) asking about Eric Cantona and we told him what we thought and never thought anything of it until a few months later he was coming across the door.\"",
      "Pallister has been a regular at Old Trafford for several years in his role as one of the club's ambassadors. He has been well-placed in the directors' box to assess Amorim during a tumultuous first six months in the dugout.",
      "\"I think everybody likes his personality,\" Pallister added, \"likes the way he talks. His system's different for Manchester United and that's going to take time, I guess. How much time he’ll get, who knows.",
      "\"If it’s anywhere near the bottom after seven or eight games next year then people are probably going to start having a different conversation. But I like him. I think he's got a really good personality and he's promised to get it right.",
      "\"I think the United faithful have got the faith in him and are sitting there waiting to see if he can do what he says and create a better Manchester United team that's got to be much better than it was last year.",
      "\"Maybe that brings a bit more pressure for him, but I certainly like the cut of his jib at the moment and hopefully he gets things right on the pitch, gets the players that he wants in there to suit his system and Manchester United can start looking like Manchester United again.\""

      "The last time Manchester United had a season devoid of European football was also one of the last in-person squad photos the players assembled for.",
      "Looking back at that line-up in September 2014, the squad is larger than necessary for a season where United played a meagre 44 domestic matches. Ben Amos, Anderson, Jesse Lingard, Andreas Pereira and Anders Lindegaard are four inclusions by default.",
      "Amos and Lindegaard did not play all season. Pereira and Anderson each played twice and Lingard once. United got Amos, Anderson and Lindegaard off the books in 2015.",
      "Jonny Evans, Tyler Blackett, Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria, Rafael da Silva, Radamel Falcao, Darren Fletcher and Adnan Januzaj had gone when the squad reassembled in front of the Scoreboard End a year later. United had the luxury of cutting their losses on misfits and past-its without any financial ramifications back then.",
      "Ruben Amorim would probably scoff at the recommendation of 27 senior professionals. United are provisionally aiming for 26, which does not seem like much of a difference but is a logical number.",
      "Three of the 26 would be goalkeepers, so whittle that down to 23 outfield players and you have two XIs and three players as cover.",
      "Van Gaal actually used 38 players in his first season, a number skewed by the wholesale changes he made for the shocking League Cup thrashing by MK Dons in early August. Saidy Janko, Reece James, Marnick Vermijl and Nick Powell were all one-and-done for the campaign that balmy night.",
      "Injuries also forced Van Gaal's hand. Paddy McNair did not have his own Wikipedia page when he made his debut against West Ham United 11 days after the first team's class photo. Evans, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones were, of course, all out injured and Blackett suspended. Tom Thorpe, on the bench, came on to play 111 seconds and remained stranded on Nelson.",
      "Including the auxiliary options Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, the only survivor of the Van Gaal squad, Amorim has seven centre backs to pick in his back three next season. Few would have Shaw in the United second XI, never mind first XI.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass are raw options on the left wing but they are a manageable pair for a sparser season. The versatile Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot are alternative options. Shaw's 27 appearances out of a possible 112 fixtures in the past two seasons place him at the back of the pecking order at centre half and left wing.",
      "United are light in midfield. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo can both play there and the former may well transition to a deeper role for the latter years of his competitive club career.",
      "But the specialists are Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Toby Collyer. Amorim seems to consider Mainoo as an option further afield, Ugarte was dropped for the Europa League final, United have tried and failed to shift Casemiro and Collyer's three starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Amad and Mason Mount are three natural fits to go into the two 10s behind the striker. The absence of a new striker is glaring but United wanted one as early as this month before Liam Delap opted for Chelsea over Cheshire.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is multi-functional and only Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland outscored him in the Premier League last term. Mbeumo is an attacker but has to be the upgrade on the right wing.",
      "United held discussions with the representatives of Sporting winger Geovany Quenda before he too chose Chelsea. Quenda is a left-footed winger by trade. As is Mbeumo.",
      "Six United players broke the 50-appearance mark in a 60-game season in 2024-25. Mbeumo started in 45 consecutive Premier League games for Brentford and completed 90 minutes in all but two. United already have durable players who can complete the entirety of one match once a week, which has to further reduce the core squad size.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's form and rapport with supporters comfortably trump Rasmus Hojlund's this calendar year, even though the Dutchman missed nine of the final ten games. As an alternative '10' or a support striker, Zirkzee has more merit as a squad player than Hojlund, who was dropped by Denmark coach Brian Riemer this month after one goal in 15 games for the national team.",
      "Chido Obi's exposure at first-team level since February and his development in the youth team make it logical to keep him in the building next season. He is a purer striker than Zirkzee and often looks more natural than Hojlund.",
      "Obi, Collyer and Shaw would be the logical 'cover'. Two academy graduates still learning their trade and the longest servant who has outstayed his welcome but is unsellable.",
      "There is a clear plan for United to streamline their attack and mould it in Amorim's image, but considerable fat to cut off. Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho is a weekly wage bill north of £1m.",
      "And United would not want any of them in a squad photo.",
      "Possible United squad 2025-25",
      "Goalkeepers: Andre Onana, new goalie, Tom Heaton",
      "Defenders: Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, Ayden Heaven, Luke Shaw, Harry Amass, Patrick Dorgu",
      "Midfielders: Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Toby Collyer, new midfielder",
      "Forwards: Bryan Mbeumo (?), Amad, Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha, Chido Obi, Joshua Zirkzee, new striker"

      "In April 2005, Sir Alex Ferguson's son, Darren, etched his name into the Wrexham history books.",
      "After Spanish forward Juan Ugarte had fired the Welsh outfit into a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute of extra-time of the 2005 EFL Trophy final at the Millennium Stadium, Ferguson added a second with two minutes left on the clock. It clinched Wrexham their first and only EFL Trophy crown to date.",
      "Celebrating with his teammates as his father watched from the stands, little did one of Ferguson's colleagues know Sir Alex had been impressed by his performance. The man in question was former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster.",
      "Foster was on loan at Wrexham from Stoke City, having joined on an initial month's loan in January that year. The deal was eventually extended until the end of the season.",
      "No doubt to Foster's disbelief, he returned to Stoke after the conclusion of his loan spell at the Racecourse Ground and was sold to United in July, signing for a reported fee of £1million. Ferguson was impressed by what he had seen from the shot-stopper when watching him play alongside his son.",
      "Foster, who was 22 at the time, made the switch to Old Trafford without having made a single first-team appearance during his four-year spell at Stoke, which featured a catalogue of loan moves. The goalkeeper soon added another loan spell to his collection, being shipped out to Championship side Watford for the 2005/06 season, making 48 appearances as they clinched promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Watford borrowed him again the following season, giving him a full season's worth of Premier League football that featured him infamously being beaten by Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson from a free-kick around 75 yards from goal. Despite being powerless to stop Watford from suffering an immediate return to the second tier, 29 Premier League appearances served him well.",
      "Back at United, the 2007/08 campaign was nothing more than a write-off for the goalkeeper, with a serious injury restricting him to just one appearance. That one outing, however, saw him mark his United debut with a clean sheet in a 1-0 away win at Derby County. United won the Premier League title that season, but in making just one appearance, he did not qualify for a medal.",
      "The following season, Foster did experience the buzz of having a winner's medal draped around his neck while donning United colours. He won the Man of the Match award as the Reds beat Tottenham Hotspur on penalties in the 2009 League Cup final at Wembley.",
      "After a goalless 120 minutes United prevailed on spot kicks, winning 4-1. Foster saved one penalty, thwarting Jamie O'Hara with what was Spurs' first penalty of the shootout.",
      "United and Foster were back at Wembley again for the 2010 League Cup final 12 months later. On that occasion, however, Foster watched from the bench as Tomasz Kuszczak started between the sticks, helping United come from behind to beat Aston Villa 2-1.",
      "Foster had played once on the road to Wembley, keeping a clean sheet in a 2-0 away win at Barnsley in the fourth round, meaning he secured a second League Cup winner's medal. He featured more prominently for United that season, earning 13 appearances.",
      "Despite helping United win two League Cup crowns in as many seasons, Foster never felt comfortable at Old Trafford, so much so that he admitted last year he \"hated every second\" of his time at the club.",
      "\"It was at a time in my life, mid-20s, 24, 25, I look back at that person who played for United then, and it's not me,\" he revealed, speaking to talkSPORT. \"I was so wet behind the ears, I didn't understand how anything worked in life.",
      "\"But I did [suffer from impostor syndrome]. I hated every second of it. I didn't enjoy it. I was nervous, I was petrified of making a mistake, petrified of what the outside world would say about it.",
      "\"That's a bad way to go about it. When you go into games thinking the worst, or fearing the worst, you're off to a bad start straight away. I'd look around at some of these big names behind me and think, 'how have I got here?'.\"",
      "After clasping his hands on the League Cup for a second time, Foster, who made 23 appearances for United in total, departed Old Trafford on a permanent basis in May 2010, joining Birmingham City. It was an opportunity for him to earn regular football.",
      "Spending just one season at St Andrew's, Foster helped Birmingham beat Arsenal 2-1 in the 2011 League Cup final, with Obafemi Martins famously scoring a last-gasp winner. It marked Foster's third League Cup triumph.",
      "Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League a few months later, meaning Foster moved on and joined West Bromwich Albion, initially on a season-long loan deal. He ended up spending seven years at The Hawthorns, making more than 200 appearances.",
      "A four-year return to Watford followed, ahead of Foster deciding to hang up his boots in September 2022. However, he was tempted out of retirement by Wrexham in March 2023, helping them end their 15-year absence from the Football League by saving a penalty in stoppage time to secure a 3–2 win over Notts County, which helped them move three points clear at the top in the race for promotion.",
      "Having played non-league football at the beginning of his career, it was somewhat fitting that his last career highlight was a historic penalty save that helped Wrexham escape the clutches of non-league football.",
      "Despite what Foster made of his time at United, nobody can ever take those League Cup winner's medals away from him, nor that penalty save at Wembley to deny O'Hara."

      "\"This summer, we will ‘buy’ Antony, we’ll ‘buy’ Sancho, we’ll ‘buy’ Casemiro, we’ll ‘buy’ Martínez, we’ll ‘buy’ Hojlund, we’ll ‘buy’ Onana, and they’re all about £17m each,\" he said. \"If we buy nobody we’re buying those players. It’s not a light switch (that can be turned off).",
      "\"These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things and have to sort that out. For (Jadon) Sancho, who now plays for Chelsea and we pay half his wages, we're paying £17m to buy him in the summer.",
      "\"Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid, but for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time. It takes time for us to move away from the past into a new place in the future. We've got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future.\"",
      "Given the number of new players needed at Old Trafford if the team are ever going to suit Ruben Amorim's style of play, it's no surprise they are adopting a new transfer strategy as they look to raise funds to buy players alongside paying off the debt owed from previous deals.",
      "Four players were classed as 'untouchable' within the United squad, with Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana absolutely not for sale. However, this stance has since changed, and United no longer regard any squad member as 'untouchable'.",
      "In fact, it's not absolutely out of the question that all four players could be plying their trade elsewhere by the start of next season. Uncertainty remains over Mainoo's situation with no agreement reached on a new deal, Garnacho has been told he is free to leave, Hojlund is generating interest from Inter Milan and Onana has endured a rollercoaster few years at United. It's unlikely all will be moved on but not impossible.",
      "United are looking to build a team in Amorim's image and the money owed for transfers made before his arrival isn't helping.",
      "If they've any chance of recruiting players good enough to take them back to where they want to be then they need to ensure they get as much as they can from any sales this summer."

      "Manchester United could finally be about to move ahead with their attempt to bolster Ruben Amorim's centre-forward options this summer.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves, United have been working to sign another attacker with Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo close to becoming signing number two. There are also plans to add another option in the final third after United recorded their worst goalscoring season in 51 years.",
      "United finished the Premier League season with -10 goal difference with Bruno Fernandes topping their scoring charts with 19. Centre-forwards Rasmus Hojlund (10) and Joshua Zirkzee (7) failed to hit the heights needed and expected of strikers to grace Old Trafford.",
      "Centre-forwards cost a premium but United are anticipated to hand Amorim a talismanic number nine to lead the line next season. In an ideal world, one of Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen would have been through the door by now, or at the very least close to joining.",
      "That hasn't been the case and after United were rejected by Liam Delap, the hunt for the right candidate goes on. Moves for Gyokeres or Osimhen could still play out but alternatives continue to be suggested, some with Premier League experience and others with an impressive goalscoring record.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic is the new name on their radar and with the Juventus star entering the final year of his contract this summer, the opportunity to sign him has never been greater. The Serbian has scored 56 goals for the Old Lady yet Randal Kolo Muani's permanent move to Turn has added another nail into his coffin.",
      "With talks over a new contract stalling due to Vlahovic's decision not to take a pay cut to stay, United could swoop in. Now, according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, Juve are plotting a move to replace the 25-year-old and progress in a deal could be the green light that Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have been waiting for.",
      "Di Marzio has claimed that 'explorative talks' have been held with Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson and his camp over a possible move. Delap's move to Stamford Bridge and the Blues' continued links to Hugo Ekitike and Osimhen means the Senegal international is no longer unsellable.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are also considering a move for Jackson but they are understood to be prioritising Lorenzo Lucca and Darwin Nunez. Yet should Nunez leave Liverpool for Juventus or Jackson moves to Italy, Vlahovic will be guaranteed to move away from the Allianz Arena and United will finally be able to get their hands on a new striker."

      "Manchester United remain focused on strengthening their team this summer, with Ruben Amorim looking to rebuild his own squad.",
      "Among the priorities is a striker and a midfielder which will be significant to kick on their 2025/26 season. United must make amends after their worst Premier League campaign since the 1973-74 season last term.",
      "With the transfer window closing on September 1, United have plenty of time to finalise more signings. However, some departures are also expected.",
      "According to Caught Offside, Amorim’s side is planning to make a move for former Fulham midfielder Joao Palhinha, who worked with the Portuguese coach at Sporting Clube de Portugal.",
      "It’s believed that Bayern Munich are open to letting Palhinha leave this summer, and his agent is reportedly exploring options to bring him back to the Premier League. The 29-year-old struggled for regular game time under Vincent Kompany last season.",
      "MEN Sport says: Palhinha enjoyed great success under Amorim in Portugal, evolving into one of Europe’s most reliable midfielders - a rise that ultimately earned him a move to the Premier League. If the reports are accurate, his arrival at United would represent a major boost, offering much-needed stability in the middle of the park alongside Bruno Fernandes. Crucially, Palhinha’s understanding of Amorim’s system could prove vital in helping the team start the new campaign strongly.",
      "Aston Villa are reportedly 'plotting' a move for midfielder Mason Mount. The 26-year-old, who joined United from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, featured 26 times across all competitions last season.",
      "According to Football 365, Villa have stepped up their interest in Mount and are looking to make a move if he is allowed to leave Old Trafford in this transfer window. Meanwhile, former Reds scout Mick Brown believes Unai Emery’s side could be preparing a move.",
      "\"United have tried to establish whether there is a market for Mason Mount,\" he said on The Inside Track podcast. \"Aston Villa have been spoken about and I think they could make a move. People remember Mason Mount at his best, that's what Villa want to help him get back to and it looks like he’s back to full fitness now.",
      "\"Villa want to strengthen because they’ve lost (Marcus) Rashford and (Marco) Asensio, so Mount is on their list. Unai Emery is a fan of his and feels he could help him to rediscover his Chelsea form. It would be an excellent move for Mount as well, because Villa are a top club, they’ve got top facilities and they’ll be playing in Europe.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: Injuries have significantly disrupted Mount's time at United so far, limiting his ability to establish any real rhythm or consistency. While there were flashes of his quality and creative influence toward the end of last season, it's still unclear whether he can stay fit long enough to make a sustained impact.",
      "His injury record remains a concern, and whether he can put those fitness issues behind him is one of the big uncertainties heading into the new campaign.",
      "Marcus Rashford has expressed his desire to one day play alongside Lamine Yamal, amid reported transfer interest from Barcelona.",
      "In a video posted on the xBuyer YouTube channel, Rashford was asked: \"Would you like to play with Lamine someday?\" He responded: \"Yeah, for sure. Everybody wants to play with the best, y'know, so hopefully, we’ll see.\"",
      "So much so that Tot Costa of Catalunya Radio have suggested that Rashford’s representatives have renewed contact with Deco to reaffirm his interest in joining Barcelona and his willingness to remain patient throughout the transfer window.",
      "The report also states that Barca are open to signing Rashford but only if the conditions are right.",
      "MEN Sport says: Rashford has made his intention to join the Spanish giants clear, but it remains to be seen whether they can meet United's demands. Given their financial situation, reports claim that Barcelona are unwilling to pay £40 million for the England international.",
      "While no other clubs have come forward for the winger yet, United may have to consider lowering the asking price to complete a sale if the situation doesn’t change. Offloading players this summer is just as important as bringing new ones in."

      "Buying Premier League proven players hasn't been a priority for Manchester United in recent years.",
      "United have tended to target foreign leagues in a bid to strengthen their squad, but there has been a notable shift during Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window at the helm.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves in a £62.5million deal, while there's hope Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will soon join him at Old Trafford. Liam Delap was the club's primary striker target after he hit 12 in his maiden Premier League campaign, though the Manchester City academy graduate opted for a move to Chelsea instead.",
      "Whether some of the signings United have made in recent years from foreign leagues have struggled to adapt to the pressures that come with being a United player or the Premier League in general is up for debate. But there's no doubting the fact that targeting players who have shown themselves to be capable operators in the English top flight reduces the risk of more wasted money.",
      "Having inexplicably made just one attacking signing last summer following a season where they finished with a minus goal difference, United are aiming to bolster their attacking options. In Signing Cunha and targeting Mbeumo, they could soon add two of last season's top Premier League marksmen to their squad.",
      "Mbeumo finished the campaign with an impressive 20 league goals, while Cunha bagged 15 for a struggling Wolves side. The pair finished in the top 10 Premier League goalscorers last season, with Mbeumo the fourth-highest goalscorer and Cunha tied on eighth with Chelsea's Cole Palmer.",
      "Should they get a deal for Mbeumo over the line, it would mark a real statement of intent from United.",
      "In fact, only one English club has ever added two new players to their squad in a summer after said players finished in the top 10 Premier League goalscorers.",
      "The only club to have done so was Tottenham back in the summer of 2001, when they brought Gustavo Poyet and Teddy Sheringham to White Hart Lane. The latter struck 15 goals for United in the 2000/01 season to finish as the league's sixth top goalscorer, with Poyet firing 11 for Chelsea before a £2.2m move across the capital.",
      "Spurs almost repeated the feat in 2012 when signing Clint Dempsey and Emmanuel Adebayor, but the latter finished in the top 10 scorers the previous season while on loan at Spurs, he simply made his move permanent in the summer.",
      "Poyet and Sheringham both hit double figures in the 2001/02 Premier League season having arrived at Spurs in the summer. If United sign Mbeumo and the former Brentford man and Cunha hit double figures in the league next season, United will be on their way to fixing their biggest problem."

      "Manchester United are no longer the clinical, threatening attacking team that once took the Premier League by storm. It's not a stretch to say that the forward line that ended the 2024/25 season won't be first-choice under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already signed to bolster United's attack, but the Brazilian isn't enough. A new centre-forward is as much of a priority as ever after Rasmus Hojlund's poor campaign, but nearly every club in Europe is fighting for a prolific goalscorer.",
      "United are putting all their eggs into Bryan Mbeumo, and after receiving the green light from the Cameroon international, the move has stalled. Tottenham's registered interest with Thomas Frank orchestrating their transfer business means the deal hasn't moved in the last week.",
      "There is still optimism that Mbeumo will leave Brentford and move to Old Trafford. Alongside Cunha, United are expected to head into the new campaign with an impressive attacking arsenal that includes Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount when fit.",
      "However, United have been here before. Signing players with impressive records - Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last term - for big fees and 12-15 months later, realising they either overpaid or the deal wasn't a smart piece of business. With the Brentford star, the early indications are that won't be the case, but the club can do their best to ensure that.",
      "First of all, secure the services of a goal-scoring striker that gives defenders nightmares. Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen both score goals for fun, and their ball-playing skills would be perfect for Mbeumo to run off and create opportunities himself.",
      "The quality around Mbeumo has to be better than what United fans were used to watching last season. Different wildcard options offer Amorim the ability to be flexible, such as playing Amad as an attacking wing-back - a role he excelled in last term.",
      "There's also little faith in Mount being Mr.Reliable this season after 46 games in two seasons. So what are the other options? In a world where transfer deals often spark a domino effect elsewhere, Mohammed Kudus could be the answer.",
      "Kudus is attracting interest from Premier League clubs including United and Chelsea. The playmaker, better as a No.10, is said to be open to leaving the London Stadium this summer and has an £85m release clause in his contract, which is valid to Premier League clubs for the first 10 days of next month.",
      "Now United certainly aren't desperate for another attacking playmaker. But adding another option in that position gives Mbeumo three (Cunha, Kudus and Fernandes) perfect partners in his position.",
      "In spite of all that, this is where Chelsea come in. Enzo Maresca's men are in the market for a new winger after deciding against buying Sancho, and Garnacho has been strongly linked with moving to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Negotiating a deal with the Blues which sees Garnacho move to Stamford Bridge would leave the door wide open for Kudus to move to United. A strong striker with the likes of Cunha, Mbeumo, Fernandes and Kudus all competing for a spot in the two No.10 positions is enough to take United from 15th to potential Champions League candidates."

      "Despite starting the season relatively slowly and not showing his best levels until after Christmas, he still managed to end the season with an impressive 19 goals to his name. He also chalked up 18 assists to finish the campaign with 37 direct goal contributions in 57 games.",

      "When United needed someone to step forward and take responsibility in dark and testing times last season, Fernandes often obliged, taking it upon himself to get his teammates out of trouble.",
      "His form between late-February and mid-April was particularly impressive. His goals and assists in the league alone earned United eight points within that period.",
      "Back in March, United chief executive Omar Berrada opened up on United's recruitment plans for the summer and said no player will be sold this summer for financial purposes. Amid talk of Al-Hilal being prepared to pay £100million for Fernandes last month, that may have tested United's resolve amid his importance.",

      "Keane has always wanted every United player to set exemplary standards, and that is fine. He has been there, done it and got the t-shirt.",

      "The opportunity to play in the Champions League and reunite with Thomas Frank are said to be key factors.",
      "United have ,reportedly, withdrawn their interest in signing free agent Jonathan David this summer. Corriere dello Sport claim Juventus now appears to be a potential destination for the Canada international, who is available on a free transfer.",
      "The report states that United, along with Napoli, Inter Milan, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain, all \"seem to have withdrawn\" from the race to sign the striker. David is said to be seeking a salary of around €7million (£6m) per year, after leaving Lille on a free transfer following five years at the club.",
      "That said, I'm not sure David would have been an ideal attacking option for Amorim. He isn't particularly strong in aerial duels, and his performances against top-tier opposition in Ligue 1 were inconsistent - something that could have become a bigger issue in the Premier League.",
      "Juventus have re-entered the race for Sancho - opening \"preliminary talks\" with United over a transfer - according to Sky Sport Italia (via Football Italia).",
      "However, they are not alone in their pursuit with Napoli also said to have made \"early moves\" for the winger. Juve, meanwhile, have begun discussions with United directly while rivals Napoli have reputedly had more contact with the player over a possible move.",
      "Juventus showed an interest in Sancho before he moved on loan to Chelsea last summer. But after Chelsea opted against signing Sancho on a permanent deal, United are now looking to offload the 25-year-old."

      "There has been a twist in the future of former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, with a second club reportedly competing to sign him.",
      "The Frenchman looked set to return to football for the first time in almost two years with AS Monaco. It was reported that he’s been offered a two-year deal with the French club, with discussions over a possible move ongoing.",
      "However, FootMercato now reports the Saudi Pro League side Al Ittihad are trying to hijack the deal. The report says that initial discussions have taken place with Pogba continuing to explore all opportunities.",
      "A move to the Saudi side would see him reunite with international teammates N’Golo Kante and Karim Benzema. Former France boss Laurent Blanc is also the head coach of the club, having joined last summer.",
      "A reunion with Kante would see the re-emergence of the midfield partnership that helped France to win the World Cup in 2018.",
      "Whoever Pogba decides to join, it will be a return to football for the 32-year-old. He was handed a provisional four-year ban following a positive drugs test, but had that reduced to 18 months on appeal, meaning he is free to play football again.",
      "He terminated his deal with Juventus back in November, meaning that he has been looking for a new club since. He has been linked with various clubs in Turkey, Brazil and the MLS, as well as a third spell back with United.",
      "Over the last week, Pogba has been in the United States as he continues training. He shared a hint that he could be closer to a return to football, posting a video at Miami Hurricanes training ground with a message reading: “Here I come.”",
      "He also shared a picture of a reunion with four former United teammates. Marcos Rojo, Sergio Romero, Edison Cavani and Ander Herera all now play for Boca Juniors who took on Benfica in the Club World Cup."

      "The Premier League is almost able to field an XI bought for £1bn, with Florian Wirtz replacing a Manchester United flop to close in on that mark.",
      "",
      "GK: Kepa Arrizabalaga (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, £71.6m)\nGianluigi Buffon was the world’s most expensive goalkeeper for 5,820 days. Ederson reigned for just over 13 months. Alisson only managed three weeks.",
      "Kepa retains that mantle seven years on, despite spending much of the intervening time not even his own club’s best shot-stopper, nor even at his own club.",
      "Chelsea continue to stumble and muddle through imperfect goalkeeping solutions despite otherwise spending literal billions assembling their squad, with Kepa deemed entirely surplus to requirements and ready to board the Arsenal train for a fair whack less than Chelsea paid.",
      "",
      "CB: Harry Maguire (Leicester to Manchester United, £80m)\nAnother whose stock has fluctuated wildly between most expensive player ever in his position and saviour of the future, to poster boy for financial incompetence, Maguire is on his latest successful quest to win over a manager who tried to phase him out.",
      "For his myriad faults and foibles, the England centre-half is as committed to the cause as they come and, as Ruben Amorim has taken barely any time to discover, can be useful if chucked up front while chasing a late goal.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United definitely just tried to copy Liverpool’s homework but missed most of the working out, figuring that simply spending a world-record sum on a defender makes them an unbeatable leader of men for the best part of the next decade.",
      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",
      "",
      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, £100m)\nIt’s done. Liverpool have smashed their transfer record, which could rise by another £16m. It’s the biggest transfer of the 2025 summer window and surely won’t be usurped.",
      "Moving from the Bundesliga to the Premier League can be too big a jump for some, but in recent years more players have adapted well, including Omar Marmoush and an improved Dominik Szoboszlai. Put it this way: Wirtz will hope to be more like Erling Haaland or Heung-min Son than Jadon Sancho – who he replaces in this XI – or Jean-Kevin Augustin.",
      "Wirtz is absolutely good enough to justify his huge transfer fee, but that kind of money can weigh heavy on some players. We’re excited to see which way he goes.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Liverpool (x2), Manchester United (x2), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1)",
      "Total cost: £989.9m",
      "Most expensive players to miss out:\nPaul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, £89.3m)\nRomelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, £75m)\nJadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nNicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, £72m)\nKai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, £71m)\nWesley Fofana (Leicester to Chelsea, £70m)\nRuben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £65m)\nKai Havertz (Chelsea to Arsenal, £65m)\nDarwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64m)\nRasmus Hojlund (Atalanta to Manchester United, £64m)\nRodri (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, £62.8m)\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United, £62.5m)\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, £62m)",

      "Arsenal were extremely interested in signing the 25-year-old during that winter window, but he understandably chose to stay in Italy.",
      "He may live to regret that decision, with Mikel Arteta’s side in a far healthier state than Juventus — though he has at least picked up a trophy with the Serie A giants.",

      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is desperate to sign an out-and-out centre-forward amid the struggles of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, and United could do a lot worse than Vlahovic at that price.",
      "And incredibly, a fresh report from our friends over at TEAMtalk says Juventus’ asking price could drop as low as €30m (£25.6m).",
      "Transfer expert Rudy Galetti claims Igor Tudor’s side will make one final attempt to renew Vlahovic’s contract, but if he doesn’t sign, he’ll be available for around that figure this summer.",

      "He is in ‘no rush’ at the moment and is awaiting contact from ‘top Premier League clubs’.",

      "19) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nWith Andre Onana needing punted and United focusing on other positions, this one feels unlikely. It’s a weird one; we don’t think it’s a load of rubbish, but it’s simply unrealistic right now.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nA move abroad is surely the plan for Sancho, but with so many United players, his salary will make any permanent departure tricky. Still, the source (Sky) is not a bad one…",
      "",
      "16) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’. But they don’t want to pay for him – yet. Of course United want a permanent sale but the chances are the best they might get is a loan with an obligation.",

Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse. One Leeds would be daft to make.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",
      "",
      "13) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",
      "",
      "11) Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nAtletico Madrid made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing, but their participation in Gianni Infantino’s wet dream may hold things up. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "10) Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season. He’d be a brilliant Guehi replacement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",
      "",
      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder.

      "",
      "22) Marcel Sabitzer (Manchester United)\nSigned on loan for the second half of 22/23, Sabitzer filled a gap for Erik ten Hag and barely put a foot wrong. His form at Borussia Dortmund and for Austria at Euro 2024 will have been hard for Man Utd to stomach. They could have had him for £15m!",

      "",
      "17) Kevin Schade (Brentford)\nBrentford paid around £20m to sign the 23-year-old from Freiburg and after a difficult spell with injuries, Schade has kicked on. He recorded 11 goals and two assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "",
      "16) Demarai Gray (Everton)\nEverton got Gray for a measly £1.5m and he did not live up to that price tag. In a good way, this time.",
      "",
      "15) Kai Havertz (Chelsea)\nStruggled when he joined, then scored the winning goal in a Champions League final, became even worse, but left for £65m. That goal and the fact Chelsea recouped the vast majority of the £72m for Havertz sees him as high as 15th.",

Six of those came in the last four Premier League matches of the season and went a very long way to keeping Forest in the top flight. In those final four fixtures, without former Union Berlin striker Awoniyi’s goals, the Reds would have got one point. They hugely benefited from his goals and picked up eight from a possible 12.",

      "3) Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)\nLiverpool wanted Martin Zubimendi last summer and after failing to convince him to leave Real Sociedad, they stuck with Gravenberch. He quickly blossomed into one of the best deep-lying midfielders in Europe. His level of consistency and availability gives him the edge over Konate.",

      "Signed to win City the Champions League, he did just that at the first attempt as his new team completed the Treble. A whopping 52 goals in 53 games in his debut season was a simply outrageous return.",

      "However, the Swedish international’s preference is to join Arsenal, who are weighing up a move for him or RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "As for a new winger, United‘s top target is believed to be Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season.",

      "Now 32, Pogba left Juventus by mutual consent last November as a result of his ban and is therefore a free agent. While there are clearly enormous risks involved in signing a player in his thirties who hasn’t played for so long, it’s no surprise that there are interested parties.",
      "Pogba left United for the second time to join the Bianconeri (for the second time) in 2022 but his second stint in Turin wasn’t anything like the success of the first.",

      "Widely recognised as one of football’s most exceptional individual talents of the last ten years, Pogba hit his peak at the perfect moment, leading France to a World Cup win in Russia in 2018. It’s fair to say it’s all been downhill from there for the Parisian.",
      "With his ban now expired Pogba is searching for a route back into the game for what he hopes will be a positive conclusion to a career that delivered so much but should really have been so much more.",

      "Al Ittihad are captained by Pogba’s one-time France teammate Karim Benzema and former Premier League players N’Golo Kante and Moussa Diaby also play for the Tigers, who finished 2024-25 in a very comfortable first place.",

      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £97.6m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £131m\nThe Wirtz deal alone would be enough to propel Liverpool to top spot at this time, without having to even remember the Jeremie Frimpong deal. Unlikely they’ve concluded their spending, either."

      "4) Dominik Szoboszlai – £60m/€69.8m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2023)\nNeeding to remodel their entire midfield, Liverpool first signed Alexis Mac Allister at an apparent knockdown price before mulling over the release clause of Szoboszlai and pulling ahead of Newcastle to trigger it before expiration.",
      "",
      "5) Kaka – £56m/€65m (AC Milan to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nThe world’s costliest signing of all time – at least for a couple of weeks. After a planned £91m move to Manchester City on £500,000-a-week wages collapsed the previous January, Kaka went for a slightly more modest fee and delivered even less flashy numbers: 29 goals, 39 assists, 120 appearances and two trophies in four years before heading back to the Rossoneri on a free.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes – £55.6m/€65m (Sporting to Man Utd, January 2020)\nAdd-ons have already far surpassed the initial £46.6m fee, with Sporting potentially due another £12.7m if Fernandes wins the PFA Player of the Year award or makes the Ballon d’Or top three. Manchester United could have doubled their money but knew they couldn’t afford the risk.",

      "7) Mason Mount – £55m/€64.2m (Chelsea to Man Utd, July 2023)\nA year from free agency and yet Manchester United’s desperation led them to pay a fair whack for the England international and Champions League winner. He has shown little since.",
      "",
      "8) Oscar – £52m/€60m (Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG, January 2017)\n“Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.” Fair play, although that continental comeback will probably never materialise now he’s back in Brazil.",

      "9) Dani Olmo – £51m/€60m (Leipzig to Barcelona, August 2024)\nThere have been registration issues owing to his new club’s continued financial difficulties but when Olmo has been able to play he has contributed healthily, with 12 goals and seven assists in a disrupted debut season.",

      "11) Zinedine Zidane – £46.6m/€76m (Juventus to Real Madrid, July 2001)\nWith Spurs presumably unwilling to let Tim Sherwood go, Real Madrid had to settle for second best and a man absolutely dripping in Galactico rizz.",

      "",
      "13) Gylfi Sigurdsson – £45m/€53m (Swansea to Everton, August 2017)\nPart of the single greatest season of Premier League club-specific signings, with Everton also bringing in Davy Klaassen (£23.6m), Henry Onyekuru (£6.8m), Sandro Ramirez (£5.2m), Jordan Pickford (£30m), Michael Keane (£25m), Wayne Rooney (free), Nikola Vlasic (£8m), Cenk Tosun (£27.5m) and Theo Walcott (£20m).",

      "14) Bernardo Silva – £43m/€50m (Monaco to Manchester City, May 2017)\nThe Portuguese has tried to leave almost every summer since but 14 trophies and more appearances under Pep Guardiola than any other player ever has been a fair consolation prize.",
      "",
      "15) Cole Palmer – £42.5m/€50.4m (Manchester City to Chelsea, September 2023)\nIt seemed like a ridiculous move at the time but was until recently the one unqualified transfer success of this Chelsea regime. Forty goals, 27 assist, 91 appearances and an eternal contract is fine business.",
      "",
      "16) Mesut Ozil – £42.4m/€50m (Real Madrid to Arsenal, September 2013)\nPoor Geraint Hughes must still be having flashbacks after being encompassed by giddy Arsenal fans celebrating the quite unfathomable capture of a Real Madrid star at his peak. Everyone knows how that five-year contract and three-year extension in 2018 played out eventually but there were moments of absolute brilliance first.",
      "",
      "17) Xavi Simons – £42.1m/€50m (Paris Saint-Germain to Leipzig, January 2025)\nAfter a pair of successful loans it was decided that selling club Leipzig would indulge in a spot of record-breaking buying, making Simons the most expensive player in their history by a mile.",

      "18) James Maddison – £40m/€46.3m (Leicester to Tottenham, June 2023)\nAt one stage the most expensive Premier League signing from a relegated club, Maddison would be fortunate to emulate a former holder of that title in Moussa Sissoko.",
      "",
      "19) Joelinton – £40m/€45m (Hoffenheim to Newcastle, July 2019)\nDoes he belong on the list of most expensive midfielders, forwards or strikers instead? Genuinely not sure. But Eddie Howe has treasured and transformed Steve Bruce’s trash in so very many ways.",

      "20) James Rodriguez – £38.5m/€45m (Porto to Monaco, May 2013)\nLong before a Galactico future could be considered, Rodriguez was moving to newly-minted Monaco as the more expensive part of a double transfer with Joao Moutinho. The Colombian scored nine goals and assisted 13 in his only Ligue Un season."

      "Manchester United have reportedly made ‘initial contact’ with a goalkeeper who kept 18 clean sheets last season as an approach for current goalkeeper Andre Onana has been made by a European big hitter.",
      "United have seemingly given up on Onana after two seasons. In both his campaigns at Old Trafford, the former Inter Milan goalkeeper has made mistakes.",
      "In last season’s Premier League, he was at fault for three goals, and more in the Europa League.",
      "As a result, United are looking to go in a different direction, while also getting rid of Onana. According to Gianluca di Marzio, Monaco have ‘made an enquiry’ for the United keeper.",
      "It is not clear how much the Ligue 1 side would be willing to bid for Onana. However, Di Marzio states the goalkeeper who United ‘like the most’ is Atalanta’s Marco Carnesecchi.",
      "It is stated ‘initial contacts’ have been made with the goalkeeper’s agent, but not with his club, Atalanta, who it’s believed would not let Carnesecchi go without a satisfactory offer being made.",
      "The Italian kept 18 clean sheets last season – 13 in Serie A and five in the Champions League. Only three men kept clean sheets more often than he did in the Italian top flight last season.",
      "As such, it seems Carnesecchi would be a good option, and is a solid alternative to Emi Martinez, who United might struggle to sign.",
      "It’s been suggested they are willing to pay £40million for him, and that they’ve been given good signs the Argentina goalkeeper wants to join, with multiple reports suggesting he’d look favourably on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But it has recently been reported that Atletico Madrid have the best chance of landing Martinez.",
      "Indeed, United and Atletico are said to be the two sides most likely to sign the keeper, but United are ‘ringing every day’ to try to convince him as it’s suggested his ‘preference’ is to go to Atletico as he wants to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "Atleti have Champions League football on offer, and United have no European football at all.",
      "That could similarly hurt them in pursuit of Carnesecchi, given he played in nine games of the elite European competition last season, and he’d play in it again next season if he were to remain with Atalanta.",
      "However, it’s unclear what the response has been from his agent to the approach from United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a decision on his “favourite” option to replace one of his current starters.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their ‘preferred’ replacement for Andre Onana and all parties are open to the transfer.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a boost in their bid to sign a replacement for Andre Onana as a £40m star has ‘offered himself’ to the Red Devils in a ...",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana."

      "Manchester United are reportedly ringing an elite goalkeeper ‘every day’ in the hopes that he’ll choose them over a move to Atletico Madrid.",
      "United are in the market for a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana had a poor season last time out. The Cameroon international was at fault for three goals the Red Devils conceded in the Premier League last season, and more in other competitions.",
      "He has been given more than enough chances over the past couple of season, and United now want to go in another direction.",
      "They have been heavily linked with Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez of late, and it’s been suggested that a move for the Argentina international is progressing.",
      "It has been suggested for a short while that Martinez wants to sign for United, having said yes if Onana is to leave, per a report, which also states there’s been ‘positive feedback’ over a move for the keeper, who wants to leave Villa.",
      "But that Martinez wants to head to United has been thrown up in the air.",
      "A report from Football Insider suggests the Red Devils are ‘ringing every day’ to get a deal over the line in the coming weeks, as it’s believed Villa don’t have long before they need to sell Martinez due to PSR pressures.",
      "But the twist is that it’s believed Martinez actually wants to go to Atletico Madrid. They and United are said to be the leading candidates, but the Spanish side is his ‘preference’ as he’d like to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "There is said to be a fear at the Metropolitano about losing Jan Oblak, given the goalkeeper – who has played 494 times for Atletico – is the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Given a lot of reports have suggested that Martinez wants to go to United, there is seemingly confusion over where he actually wants to end up.",
      "Atletico have the pull of Champions League football, while United will not play any European football at all next season, so there is certainly good reason for Martinez to want to move to the Spanish side and not the Red Devils.",
      "If Villa are indeed planning to sell before June 30, when the books have to be finalised, then there will seemingly be an answer over where Martinez will end up at very soon.",

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer. Here are the 10 best available.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli, it would seem. He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga or Serie A feels right.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye England star as Mbeumo race tightens…",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer and after rumours of an exit, chances are he will sign a new deal.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 93 goals in 105 games. Bobbins league or not, that’s very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the window might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso gone, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a brilliant forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in 2022, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Perhaps the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games last season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there has been a real lack of interest.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but he reportedly wants to stay in Europe. Liverpool have been linked with a swap deal involving Darwin Nunez, which almost makes too much sense. We shall see.",

      "The Manchester-born striker made his Premier League debut under Louis van Gaal in 2016 but the former fresh-faced wonderkid is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford.",
      "Having fallen out of favour with Ruben Amorim, he spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but is back in Manchester, now looking for his next move.",
      "Here’s where we reckon Rashford could end up:",
      "",
      "After some depressing final months at Old Trafford, Rashford seemed to be back enjoying football when he moved to Villa Park.",
      "He contributed to 10 goals in 17 games as he and fellow loanees Marco Asensio played a part in Villa’s run in and push for the Champions League but a return for Rashford seems unlikely for 325,000 reasons.",
      "Villa are one of the clubs thought to be under most pressure from PSR rules but it is actually UEFA’s financial laws that could cause the Birmingham club a headache.",
      "From the 2025-26 season, UEFA say only 70% of a club’s spending can be on ‘squad cost’ which is the sum of first-team and manager wages, transfer fees, agent and intermediary costs and fees paid to pay off former players/managers divided by day-to-day income, incoming transfer player and manager fees and any other transfer income.",
      "In their most recent published accounts, Villa’s overall wage bill was £252m and their revenue £257.7m. So adding Rashford with his £325,000 salary to that equation seems silly.",
      "Verdict: Incredibly unlikely",
      "",
      "If Rashford returning to Villa seems impossible, him staying at Manchester United looks just as unlikely.",
      "But with an expensive contract that runs until 2028, Rashford would be within his rights to stay at the club and take home his pay cheque.",
      "However, with a World Cup next year, Rashford will want to play so he can be part of Thomas Tuchel’s England side.",
      "Verdict: Very unlikely",
      "",
      "Having offered his services to them in January, Rashford moving to Barcelona looked a real possibility this summer but developments in the last few days seem to have put an end to it.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported on Thursday that the Camp Nou club had agreed terms with Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams having long been interested in the Spain forward.",
      "The transfer, not to mention the money involved in, would see a player take up Rashford’s favoured spot, meaning his chance to move to Barcelona may have come and gone.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely",
      "If you glanced across any transfer rumour so far this summer, chances are Galatasaray have been mentioned.",
      "The Turkish side have been linked with almost every player going and reports of their interest in Rashford first emerged in November.",
      "A move to Villa cooled that link but with Rashford still on the market, Galatasaray could look to tempt him to Turkey to join a strike force which Leroy Sane will soon be a part of.",
      "Verdict: Possible",
      "",
      "Rashford need only ask Scott McTominay how a move to Italy can rejuvenate a career and Serie A has become somewhat of a rescue place for misfiring Premier League players.",
      "Of the Italian clubs, it is Inter who have been linked with the Sun suggesting the San Siro side were interested. But given it is the Sun that may well be incorrect.",
      "But wages may well be an issue. Inter’s current top earner is Lautaro Martinez on €320,000 a week, meaning Rashford’s £325,000 would make him easily the club’s best-paid player, potentially disrupting squad harmony and putting Inter under considerable financial strain.",
      "The Champions League final showed how Inter needed some younger blood to go with their experience and if they can get Rashford to drop his wages, they could make a move for him.",
      "Verdict: Possible (if Rashford drops wage demands)",
      "While the outrageous spending has curtailed somewhat, the Saudi Pro League remains a comfortable landing place for unwanted Premier League stars.",
      "To date, five English players have made the move to Saudi and Rashford may well join them if he cannot find a better move in Europe.",

      "In this Club Cup abomination, where the Randomizer 2000 was used to deselect some of the best European teams and allow some marginal US teams, and where the better clubs can buy whatever they need to smooth out their weak spots and plenty of time to train and work out a system – there is no value, no real attraction in seeing part-timers dumped by ultra professionals. It’s not the FA Cup, either, with it’s history.",
      "In the World Cup, with the US being a smorgasbord of heritage, there might be interest in seeing either the US national team AND a team from the homeland. Being a club competition, there is no reason someone from say, New Jersey, is likely to want to support Los Angeles in a match against a team from South Korea. With the US being a vast country, it also doesn’t make it easy to follow your own team across the country and back either.",
      "And that’s before we consider the time of day, the fact that Americans receive significantly fewer vacation days (PTO, as it’s often called) than Europeans, and all the other major issues confronting the country. These same issues act as a significant deterrent for ‘foreigners’ attending these games – unless absolutely necessary.",
      "While I can understand that some sports journalists have a job to do, the amount of fawning over this competition is sickening. Much was made of the first game and opening ceremony, as well as articles implying that it is a very English attitude to be against this competition while the Latin world is loving it. Spanish is becoming the lingua franca of football, as if those same pundits had never been to Miami to realize it is a microcosm of the Latin American world. However, it is so different from the rest of the U.S.; for example, Chicago, Boston, and New York would have more Irish and Italian heritage. The point being that one decent crowd for the opener in Miami was not going to define this tournament.",
      "What’s worse is that teams like Man City, PSG, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern, who already have dominated their national leagues through fair or foul means (more foul than fair) will come out of this with considerably more financial ammo to dominate their leagues into the future.",
      "While I dislike the ‘transfer season’ and the influx of ‘never heard of before’ journalists claiming that every player under the sun is going, not going, u-turning, or batting their eyelashes at your team, it is still preferable to this tournament that primarily serves to feed the ego of that insufferable tw*t, Infantino.\nPaul McDevitt",

      "It’s no good if the Champions of England, Spain and Italy are not there, you say? That’s surely the most irrelevant of your largely irrelevant points.",
      "First off, who cares? Secondly, who really f**king cares?",
      "The entry criteria for the tournament isn’t about National champions unless you’re the host nation. Why do I feel like your gripe is actually about the absence of the Champions of England, the bestest league in all the lands in all the worlds. Merely including others to make it sound more reasonable but you fool only yourself.",
      "Besides, the qualification cycle for this tournament doesn’t include the 2024/2025 season. It’s 2020/21 to 2023/24. So really the only champions of England – Man City – for the relevant period are there. Even if they aren’t, it’s still wouldn’t matter. Because it’s not about league winners.",
      "Italy, the European champions at the time, didn’t play at the World Cup in Qatar. Because it’s a different tournament, with different qualification criteria.",
      "Literally the only good thing about the CWC is the maximum two per country limit unless a country has more than two continental champions. The cynic in me believe this would probably be tweaked in future versions to enable more European heavyweights to participate but I hope it stays as it is (it won’t).",
      "And don’t get me started on the complaints about player welfare. Yes it’s becoming a really big problem but not one uniquely created by the CWC. It feels like just another excuse to criticize the tournament.",
      "How does the actual World Cup or any other summer tournaments address the issue of player welfare? Does the CWC make it worse in any way? No, it’s exactly the same.\nAY (You don’t have to watch it if you don’t like it, not many are watching it anyway)",

      "Return of the diddy men (Ed – surely there’s a better phrase?)\nBack in the day, football was much simpler, you were either an artist or an artisan, and by artisan I mean borderline thug. Think Norman “bite yer legs” Hunter or Ron “chopper” Harris (where have those colourful nicknames gone?).",
      "Conversely, the artists were, by and large, slight. Pele was only 5′ 8″ and both George Best and Dennis Law were both 5′ 9″. Then somewhere along the way it all changed and gave rise to the athlete. Thierry Henry was 6′ 2″ and built like a sprinter. And more followed, Drogba, Van Persie, Shearer, all over 6 feet tall.",
      "Yes the old maxim “if you’re good enough, you’re tall enough” still applied, but you had to be bloody good otherwise it was men against boys.",
      "As boring as “tiki taka” was, you have to give Guardiola credit for putting the smaller, technically gifted player back on the map, yet, in a flash they were gone again. And after seeing the manchild Haaland chew up the Premier League, I feared football was going to go the way of American professional sports.",
      "So it was refreshing to see PSG and Barcelona lead the way back with their Diddy Men. Vitinha and Neves bossed the CL final and Barcelona’s seem to have an almost endless supply of Gavi’s and Pedri’s. It seems like only in the English Agricultural League where these players don’t appear to cut mustard. It’s questionable if even Paul scholes would make it in the EPL these days. And we all know that Messi wouldn’t be able to “do it” on a cold Tuesday night in Stoke!",
      "So, fast forward to the 2026 World Cup, being played in the heat of the American summer. What are going to be the chances of the gut busting runs of Haaland, Mbappe, etc. going to fare against the economical styles of possession based teams?",

      "Omar Berrada: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course. We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it?\"",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "By Lyall Thomas and Dharmesh Sheth",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 06:07, UK",
      "Manchester United are relaxed about their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo despite being aware of Tottenham's interest in the Brentford forward.",
      "United are expected to go back in with another offer for Mbeumo after having their initial bid worth up to £55m rejected. It remains to be seen whether Tottenham will follow up their initial talks or move on to Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Brentford value Mbeumo, who effectively has two years left on his deal, at more than £60m and are willing to listen to offers.",
      "United have other targets in Mbeumo's position, including Semenyo, and have their own values in mind for both players.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",
      "Mbeumo can also create something from nothing. According to expected goals (xG), he scored nearly eight goals more than the quality of chances presented to him last season - more than any other player in the Premier League.",
