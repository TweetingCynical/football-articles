      "Manchester United could do themselves a massive favour later this month. The Red Devils are in the Europa League final against Premier League rivals Tottenham.",
      "Victory in Europe’s second tier competition would be a huge boost to Ruben Amorim’s side given it would earn them silverware, as well as a place back in the Champions League. And that would go a long way in convincing potential signings to come to Old Trafford ahead of a dramatic rebuild under Amorim.",
      "Speaking of signings, plenty could potentially be on the horizon. A number of stars have been linked with moves to Old Trafford, some of those currently playing in the Premier League - others not.",
      "Any business could even see some of the current United stars moved on. With that being said, find out the latest transfer news and rumours below:",
      "Liam Delap is reportedly favouring a move to Manchester United should he leave Ipswich this summer. The former Manchester City man is expected to depart Portman Road following the Tractor Boys’ relegation.",
      "United have been linked in the past and it now appears their chances of getting a deal done have been improved. As per talkSPORT, Delap is ‘leaning’ towards a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea are also interested, while Nottingham Forest have also been mentioned as contenders for his signature. Delap reportedly has a £30m release clause written into his contract with Ipswich.",
      "River Plater chief Jorge Pablo Brito has claimed that his side are not in a rush to decide the future of Man United linked wonderkid Franco Mastantuono. Speaking to ESPN via Sport Witness, he said: “The important thing is to remain calm with Mastantuono, understanding that he’s 17 years old. He’s not in a hurry, nor is River Plate.",
      "“The best thing to do when something is in full swing is to let it continue to grow and not touch anything. You have to be very careful and not put more pressure on him than he already has.”",
      "Like Delap, Mastauntuono has also been linked with a move to Premier League rivals Chelsea.",
      "Regarding outgoings, Rio Ferdinand has suggested that Amorim wants to see around 50 percent of the squad at his disposal sold this summer. Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the former defender said: \"I think he looks around the dressing room and thinks, 'If I could wave a magic wand, in the next five years at least 50% of this team wouldn't be here.'",
      "\"They're not good enough and they're not right for the way he wants to play. I look at him and think that he needs, minimum, two good windows of getting rid of the ones he doesn't require but also getting in players that he really needs.”"

      "It's only a matter of time before Xabi Alonso is confirmed as the next Real Madrid manager after announcing he would be leaving Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season. The Spaniard will have huge plans about who will be in his team at the Bernabeu as he looks to help them bounce back from a barren season.",
      "Alonso is one of the most highly-rated young managers in football and stands to inherit a star-studded team featuring stars like Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr, but he will have idea of which areas he wants to strengthen too.",
      "Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has already been confirmed as the next Brazil boss and is should be only a matter of time before Alonso gets to work at his former club. He should only need a handful of signings to get his new side back in fighting condition for trophies again and it won't be long before he starts identifying those targets.",
      "Thibaut Courtois is the undisputed No 1 in goal and that won't change under Alonso, but he might need to start thinking about how his defence might look. Madrid have some ageing centre-backs, with Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba both aged 32, but they still have enough quality to star next season.",
      "Eder Militao will also hope to get in the team under Alonso but Los Blancos' new boss will want at least one new centre-back who can compete for a place and add much-needed competition.",
      "Jonathan Tah was a favourite of Alonso's at Leverkusen and he fancies taking the centre-half to Madrid with him, according to Spanish outlet AS. The commanding 29-year-old is in demand, though, and has also been linked with Manchester United.",
      "The German is available on a free transfer and would be a huge coup. But with Bayern Munich also sniffing around, a deal may not be as straightforward as it seems.",
      "While Trent Alexander-Arnold will consider himself as a defender, he is expected to operate between defence and midfield in Alonso's back three and play more as an attacking wing-back that will get forward and cause problems down the flanks.",
      "The England international's move is yet to be confirmed but is a formality after confirmation he will leave Liverpool this summer on a free transfer. It's believe Madrid are hoping to get Alexander-Arnold over the line before they depart for the Club World Cup.",
      "On the opposite flank, Alonso is said to want another left wing-back, especially after Ferland Mendy was ruled out with a serious muscle injury and is unlikely to be back before said tournament starts next month.",
      "Alonso could, then, launch another raid on Leverkusen for Alex Grimaldo, who has been superb across the last two seasons. He registered seven assists in the Bundesliga this season and had 13 last season, in addition to 10 goals.",
      "In the middle of the park, Federico Valverde is likely to be the automatic starter, but with Luka Modric approaching the end of his contract, Alonso will want a younger midfielder he can depend on for years to come. Martin Zubimendi has been strongly linked with Arsenal, but is also on Alonso's wishlist and the player may prefer to stay in Spain at one of the country's top clubs rather than join the Premier League.",
      "Find a way to accommodate both Vinicius Jr and Kylian Mbappe will be a complex problem for any manager in football to solve but Madrid's attack practically picks itself. Alonso might find himself shoehorned into playing both Vinicius and Mbappe up front, with Bellingham playing just off them in the No 10 role, unless he opts to play the former two as wingers and buy a new forward.",
      "It will should become a real dilemma as superstar Mbappe will want to be the focal point up front, but Alonso may soon come to realise why Ancelotti had so many issues getting his squad to gel as a unit this season - and perhaps he'll see that the balance is wrong with Mbappe as the lone striker."

      "Ruben Amorim has reached into his own pocket to counteract Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting crusade at Manchester United by buying Europa League final tickets for his staff.",
      "United play Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 in a shoot-out for much-needed silverware and a place in next season’s Champions League. But while 15,000 United fans will be inside the San Mames next Wednesday, many family and friends of Amorim’s support staff had been set to miss out.",
      "Ratcliffe has proved an unpopular presence at the top of the club since taking charge last February, with his penny pinching and job cuts demoralising staff. But the petrochemicals billionaire has remained unbowed in his quest to turn around the financial mess at the club and told staff there would be no complimentary tickets for the biggest game of United’s season.",
      "ESPN reports that Amorim’s coaches, physios and support team were told that they would have to pay for their own tickets for family and friends. The official reason is that the club wanted to ensure that as many as possible of United’s allocation went to supporters.",
      "But Amorim decided to step in and undercut Ratcliffe’s directive, quickly telling 30 of his staff that he would personally fork out for their tickets. The United head coach has endured a largely miserable first six months in charge and wants to reward his staff.",
      "Amorim brought several of his staff from Sporting Lisbon with him to Manchester and needs to keep them close heading into a pivotal summer. The 40-year-old has admitted his United side are “maybe the worst” in the club’s 147-year history but knows victory over Spurs will change the narrative.",
      "United’s players have been allocated two tickets each, but family and friends who do make the trip will do so at their own cost, with INEOS refusing to pay for their travel. It is the continuation of a strong theme of the Ratcliffe era, with a barbecue reportedly planned instead of a parade if they win in Bilbao.",
      "The 72-year-old, who has a personal wealth of £12.3billion according to Forbes, has made headlines for making what he believes are unpopular but necessary cuts at United. He has cancelled the Christmas party, reduced ticket allocations and benefits for the FA Cup final and made hundreds of staff redundant.",
      "With United sitting 16th in the Premier League following their 2-0 defeat by West Ham on Sunday, the club have cancelled their end-of-season awards dinner at Old Trafford. That decision is understood to have been taken due to the lack of success on the pitch, rather than to save money, but it is indicative of the direction of travel under Ratcliffe’s stewardship.",
      "\"Manchester United has become mediocre,\" Ratcliffe said earlier in the season. \"It is supposed to be one of the best football clubs in the world. We have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions. If you shy away from the difficult decisions, then nothing much is going to change.",
      "\"I know we get criticism in the press, but we do need to challenge the cost of running this club because what I want to be free for us to do is buy really good footballers, not spend so much of the money on infrastructure. We can't run a business at a loss, which is where United have been in the last couple of years.\""

      "But with Ruben Amorim's flops down in 16th place in the Premier League, it has been decided that an awards night is not appropriate this time around, despite United taking part in the Europa League final against Tottenham next Wednesday.",

      "A report from The Times also states that internally the idea of a lavish dinner would not go down well after United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe embarked on a ruthless cost-cutting drive this year, reducing staff numbers by around 400.",

      "Manchester United intend to retain Ruben Amorim this summer - even if they lose the Europa League final. The Portuguese coach has presided over a horrendous Premier League campaign which has led to questions over his future.",
      "The team have performed well below par and will register their worst top flight finish for decades, but have been able to up their game on the European stage. They've seen off the likes of Lyon and Athletic Bilbao and will now play in the final against Tottenham next week.",
      "Victory offers a route into the Champions League, but even a defeat won't change the stance of the United hierarchy. They believe that Amorim cannot properly be judged until he's had a transfer window to bring in players who suit his unique system, reports The Guardian.",
      "Amorim has stuck defiantly to his philosophy since arriving in Manchester to replace Erik ten Hag in November. He's managed just six Premier League wins in that time, which has seen the team fall to 16th. After their loss against West Ham on Sunday the head coach appeared to question his own credentials.",
      "He said: \"It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons\". Amorim has also questioned whether the Red Devils should compete in the Champions League.",
      "The United hierarchy, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, have owned up to their error after retaining Ten Hag last summer despite months of poor results. The Dutchman was handed a new deal, backed in the summer, but then sacked shortly after.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-3 system bought huge success in Sporting Lisbon, where he won two league titles, but it hasn't led to an upturn in results in Manchester. The club have had to endure several embarrassing home defeats with a number of players continuing to underwhelm.",
      "With the exception of Bruno Fernandes nearly the entire United squad is struggling to match expectations. As a result nearly the entire squad is up for sale with the Manchester outfit prepared to listen to a number of offers. More worryingly is the return to form of Marcus Rashford and Antony - two men who were struggling only to rediscover top form out on loan.",
      "Amorim will certainly need to bolster his resources out wide in the summer, bringing in individuals capable of playing as wing-backs. More firepower is also a priority with United's frontmen struggling for goals, which has led to links with the likes of Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap."

      "A worst ever Premier League finish was confirmed several weeks ago but the team appear determined to sink even further. Their record at Old Trafford makes for grim reading and Amorim looks to be out of answers.",
      "He claimed that he shoulders the responsibility and maybe he wasn't the man to take United forward following their latest defeat. He's since admitted he's embarrassed by the state of affairs as the 40-year-old, who was highly-rated before coming to England, struggles to turn around the club's fortunes.",
      "The Europa League has provided some hope and United can claim a trophy in Bilbao next week should they beat Tottenham. That would come with Champions League revenue, but those in the club have admitted that it won't salvage what has been a poor season.",
      "It certainly leaves Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy with a decision to make. They made a clanger by retaining Erik ten Hag, handing him a new deal and then sacking him within six months so they will be loathed to get another managerial call wrong.",
      "But the warning signs are very clear! Amorim is clearly a very good coach and came with a huge reputation. And Manchester United has a habit of ruining reputations! It can eat good managers up - and spit them out.",
      "Two big things worry me. His tactical inflexibility. That is ridiculous. He’s so wedded to a back three that he’d rather play that and lose than actually be adaptable and go to a system that suits his current players. It’s a huge weakness on his make up. Players make systems, not the other way round.",
      "His constant negativity. He makes good headlines and I’m not about to tell him to stop! But Sunday’s message that he’d quit if results don’t improve next year, didn’t even feel remotely fresh. He says something similar every week. That hardly lifts the players. Maybe he’s trying to lower expectations but I’m not sure it works.",
      "They must stick with him into next season. United would love that to be with Champions League qualification which would be a game changer. But even if they lose the Europa final, they can’t ditch him so quickly.",
      "Of all Amorim’s mistakes this season, the biggest one was taking the job when he did. Talk about a poisoned chalice. And while he has to take a good portion of responsibility for Manchester United’s embarrassing domestic form, he inherited a squad that is barely fit for Premier League purposes.",
      "That he has got the same squad to the final of the Europa League - going unbeaten in that competition - is a minor miracle and should make him immune from dismissal this summer. Amorim needs a pre-season to get at least some of the players he wants - easier said than done - and he needs a pre-season to get the current players fit.",
      "Of all the big issues he faces, the deficiencies in fitness and physicality of this United squad is right up there amongst them - and Amorim will crack the whip ahead of next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is clearly not averse to sacking people but Amorim should not be on his list.",
      "Amorim did not want to take the Manchester United job mid-season in November - and his judgement has been proved right. HIs first domestic campaign has been horrendous with so many of the squad he inherited simply not suitable for his playing style",
      "But the Portuguese, 40, was the best young coach in Europe last year and six months at Old Trafford does not make him the worst. He has clearly been shocked by the poor standards at Manchester United and some of his statements have been shockingly honest - but also true. Amorin will be sacked if Premier League results continue.",
      "But winning the Europa League and using the Champions League money to invest in new players - and a full pre-season to drill his squad - will see an immediate improvement next term. Otherwise it is back to square one again. But the recent history at Old Trafford suggests they will spare their manager this summer - and then sack him in the autumn anyway.",
      "The remit of any incoming manager - particularly mid-season - is to improve the fortunes of their side. Has Amorim done that? Not really.",
      "If anything, the Red Devils’ dismal season has gotten even worse over recent weeks. There’s been no real sign of development at Old Trafford over the six months that Amorim has been at the helm and that should be a real worry for club chiefs.",
      "But there is of course one saving grace. United could waltz out of Bilbao this month with a trophy under their arm and a ticket back into the Champions League. And that will go a long way to helping Amorim bring in the players that he wants this summer, which MAY change the entire trajectory of the Portuguese’s stint at the club.",
      "There’s also no point sacking him and putting United back at square one. Given the money spent, it would be a misstep to invest even more in sacking Amorim and finding his potential replacement.",
      "He should be given a stay of execution for now. But should things fail to improve heading into next season then this debate should definitely re-emerge.",
      "Sacking another manager will solve United's problems like installing traffic lights on the M60 will cure traffic jams.",
      "Amorim had misgivings about joining the club mid-season because he needed time to bed in his 3-4-3 shape and that's not easy when you are losing at home to West Ham, Wolves, Newcastle, Brighton and Palace with no time to implement your philosophy on the training ground.",
      "Winning the Europa League would paper over a lot of cracks, but it would also bring in upwards of £50million in revenue - and since money is the language Sir Jim and the Old Trafford cabal understand most, they are better off sticking with Amorim if he delivers a trophy.",
      "The United manager's raw honesty has not helped his own cause, but at least he speaks the truth: This is the worst team in the club's history and they are embarrassing.",
      "Give him key signings down the spine of the team - Jarrad Branthwaite and Viktor Gyokeres for starters - and the line on the graph should turn upwards sharply. But if Amorim leaves, and United spin the merry-go-round again, who's going to install the winning culture that's been missing since Fergie retired?",
      "As much as I have reservations about philosophy having priority over getting the best out of a squad of players, it would only add to Manchester United's chaos if they parted ways with Amorim. The season has been a disaster and was heading that way without his influence.",
      "The Portuguese coach has been employed for his style and pedigree and was even persuaded to come in early, rather than with a full pre-season to work in. It has been far from ideal.",
      "The 40-year-old has a lot to prove but should only be judged by the after an extensive pre-season and some activity in the transfer market which actually shapes the team into the framework he wants. All of that is not to say Amorim has earned any credit, though European outings perhaps offer some hope. United could easily find themselves in the same situation as earlier this season.",
      "It isn't time to twist yet, but ultimately these kind of results can only carry on for so longer. Whilst I believe Amorim is a good manager this currently doesn't seem like a good fit.",
      "The red side of Manchester has been a graveyard for managers and players and I think plenty around Europe would still hold Amorim in a positive light, largely because of what he did at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "His loyalty to his philosophy has veered into naivety at times, he could've gone more conventional, but clearly he's prepared to die on the hill he sits on. There's no getting away from the fact these United players aren't good enough to do what he wants to do.",
      "But looking at it from an ownership perspective, Ratcliffe and co have already got rid of Ten Hag and their eye for a manager is clearly in question. Equally, if Amorim was given the boot, why would any potential manager put their hat into the ring knowing you might not even get a summer with your players.",
      "If Manchester United are prepared to sack Ruben Amorim after six months and a cup final then it was a waste of time to appoint him in the first place. It was no secret that his style and the club’s personnel didn’t exactly sync up, and there was never going to be a quick fix.",
      "Even if United lose to Spurs in Bilbao, Amorim deserves a summer window to work on building the squad he wants. They were prepared to back Erik ten Hag last summer when the cracks were already visible, so this is the least they can do for his successor.",
      "None of us can know why the league form has been so far from what United have shown in Europe, but at least in the latter there have been signs this group of players wants to fight for the boss. There’s no point ripping it all up to start again."

      "Ashworth, 54, garnered an impressive reputation within the game during his previous tenure with the FA before leaving in 2018. He has subsequently held roles in the Premier League at Brighton - where he once again earned plenty of plaudits for his work - and Newcastle before being pursued by United.",
      "He was eventually given the green light to proceed with a move to Old Trafford in July 2024 but lasted just five months in the role, with United paying £4.1million in total to both acquire and part ways with the Magpies' former sporting director.",
      "It emerged back in March that he had held discussions over a potential return to The FA and, as first revealed by The Telegraph, an agreement has now been reached.",
      "Ashworth will be given a broad remit in his new role and is expected to start work 'imminently'. It's outlined that he will effectively be in full control of the FA's football association alongside the organisation's chief executive, Mark Bullingham.",
      "Overseeing a refurbishment of the national training facility, dubbed 'St Georges Park 2.0' will be among the primary projects to be overseen by Ashworth, whose standing within the game has not been affected by his surprisingly brief tenure at Manchester United. The Red Devils are said to have 'agreed to release Ashworth to work' under the terms of his severance package.",
      "United have not sought an out-an-out replacement for Ashworth since his departure with chief executive, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, the club's technical director, instead taking on more responsibility.",
      "A statement confirming Ashworth's departure at the time read: “Dan Ashworth will be leaving his role as Sporting Director of Manchester United by mutual agreement. We would like to thank Dan for his work and support during a transitional period for the club and wish him well for the future.”"

      "Jose Mourinho has previously claimed that the manager at Manchester United needs to be allowed to focus on coaching - not have to involve himself in other aspects of the club. The Special One is among those to try and fail at Old Trafford, but believes the structure was all wrong.",
      "Mourinho led the Red Devils for just over two years, but ultimately couldn't make the club English champions once again despite being hired off the back of several title-winning exploits.",
      "His best effort was second, when he worked under the Glazers' hierarchy led by Ed Woodward. Things have changed massively since at Old Trafford with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now leading the club's football operations, but fortunes are yet to change.",
      "Prior to INEOS coming on board the likes of Mourinho and Louis van Gaal had failed to have the desired impact in Manchester and the Special One insists that too many coaches have been axed for it to be their fault instead pointing the blame elsewhere.",
      "He previously told Fabrizio Romano : \"Some of them were very good but none of them have been successful or survived for very long. You can't blame all the coaches. The only conclusion is that the environment in which they were working didn't work.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has taken a hands on role with Omar Berrada coming in as CEO. Dan Ashworth has been hired and since fired as the club's sporting director. Jason Wilcox also has a senior role and Mourinho insists whoever is at the helm needs to be allowed to focus on the players and getting results.",
      "He said: \"I think the ideal scenario is when the club has a structure that allows the coach to be the coach on the pitch, in the training ground, in the dressing room. I was the coach at Inter, at Real Madrid, I was the coach in my first spell at Chelsea. I was the coach at Porto. In other clubs I was not just the coach and that is a very difficult environment to coach.\"",
      "Mourinho finished sixth in his first season with the Manchester outfit, but did deliver the Carabao Cup and the Europa League. Following that he landed second spot, but then saw results nosedive in his third campaign.",
      "He is being linked with a sensational return to Manchester as the club weigh up whether Ruben Amorim is the right man to lead them forward. Mourinho has never been shy in laying down what he wants and appear to take a swipe at the amount of roles he's had to take on in some of his previous jobs.",
      "\"In some club structures, you have to be the coach, you have to be the technical director, you have to be the communication director,\" he said. \"Then you have to be the image that defends the club, the players, that is something people realise but at the same time, it is something the coach doesn't like.\""

      "Allegri is still seen as one of football's most talented coaches despite a difficult second spell in Turin that saw him fall away from title contention and even finished as low as seventh in his second season back.",

Amorim, 40, watched his United side lose their 17th Premier League match of the campaign on Sunday as fellow strugglers West Ham United won 2-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "While United have shined in Europe – having reached the final of the Europa League by overcoming Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate in the semis – their domestic form has been appalling. Amorim admitted he was \"embarrassed\" by the West Ham performance and result that left United in 16th position.",
      "Ferdinand admitted it may require multiple transfer windows for Amorim to build the squad in his vision. He also believes the ex-Sporting CP head coach may clear out as much as 50% of the United camp to fund and make room for new recruits.",
      "The ex-United defender said on his Rio Presents podcast: \"I think he looks around the dressing room and thinks, 'If I could wave a magic wand, in the next five years at least 50% of this team wouldn't be here.'",
      "\"They're not good enough and they're not right for the way he wants to play. I look at him and think that he needs, minimum, two good windows of getting rid of the ones he doesn't require but also getting in players that he really needs.”",
      "Ferdinand added: \"There has to be a lot of things to go right for us to make a dramatic turn on this. He's coaching the team to understand what he wants, which has led to him getting terrible results in the Premier League consistently.",
      "\"He needs to recruit dynamic athletes. I don't want no mavericks, or players that are frilly and can do pirouettes. No, no, people that can run past and over people as well.”",

      "\"I have a clear feeling that I know what this team needs to be so much better, and that has helped me to maintain that level of not go down so much and not so high in some moments.”",
      "United's only hope for some sort of salvation lies in the Europa League, where they face 17th-placed Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao. Victory in the final next Wednesday would see the Red Devils qualify for a place in next season's Champions League.",
      "However, that was at the back of Amorim's mind at Old Trafford when he addressed the media in his post-match press conference. He said: \"How is a manager of Manchester United supposed to feel in that position? Embarrassed.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"Everybody is focused on the final. The final is not the biggest thing in our football club. We need to change a lot of things. If we don't change the way we play and perform and feel this urgency of winning every game, we should not play in the Champions League.",

      "That combination copped criticism with some claiming United needed more star quality in that area. The pair were conveniently named McFred and were viewed as a safe option by Solskjaer, but it appeared to hold back the Scottish star from unlocking his potential.",

I know Ole praises both of them – which is beyond me – I always thought there was something in Scott. He had more than Fred going on, but as a partnership it didn’t work, it wasn’t happening, United weren’t competing in midfield.",
      "\"It tarnished him a little bit, 'McFred' wasn’t it. He’s added to his game, to be fair to him. He’s always had a goal in him but he’s got that up to another level. If he wasn’t scoring the goals at Napoli we wouldn’t be talking about him. But you can’t keep talking about players who leave a big club and say we should have kept them.",

They haven’t brought in better which is the problem for the club. United’s recruitment has been that poor that you still talk about former players.\"",

      "In Ruben Amorim's brutally honest press conference after Manchester United's latest Premier League defeat, there was one glaring omission from the subjects discussed. It covered culture, embarrassment, standards and what needs to change.",
      "But there, sitting in the corner, was the elephant in the room. Is this system ever going to work in English football? And perhaps more importantly, is this style ever going to work for United?",
      "Amorim has made it abundantly clear he has no plans to abandon his 3-4-2-1, so it has become the forgotten issue. There is no point asking about it when you know what the answer is going to be. And there is evidence that three-man defences can succeed here. Antonio Conte did it with Chelsea, and Oliver Glasner and Vitor Pereira have had some success with Crystal Palace and Wolves this season.",
      "But the version Amorim has delivered to domestic audiences so far is slow, predictable and defensive. It is simple to play against because the build-up is easy to read, and the pace of the games doesn't allow enough players to get forward. In European contests, when the pace is slower, when both teams seek possession, and pressing systems aren't always as intense, Amorim's United have time to get their structure right.",
      "That isn't happening against Premier League teams. In the league under Amorim, United have won just six of their 25 games, losing 13 of them. It's two-thirds of a season, and the form record reads like that of a team battling relegation. Add in cup games and United lost to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, beat Leicester City at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and had a penalty shoot-out win against Arsenal and a defeat against Fulham.",
      "It is a dreadful record that contrasts sharply with the Europa League performances. On Sunday, Amorim blamed a lack of urgency in the Premier League compared to Europe, but a final in Bilbao against domestic opposition might well be instructive. Amorim's United have already been beaten twice by Spurs.",
      "If the Europa League version of United turn up and get the better of Tottenham for once, it will give credence to Amorim's idea that something has been missing from Premier League games. If it's a repeat of what we've seen on these shores, then his tactical set-up has to come into sharper focus once more.",
      "But there should already be alarm bells ringing. It's easy to write recent defeats off as abandoning the Premier League season to focus on Europe, but team selections have remained strong, and this is not a new phenomenon either.",
      "United lost five of their six Premier League games in December. Under Amorim, they have failed to score against Arsenal, Bournemouth, Wolves (twice), Newcastle, Crystal Palace, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest and now West Ham. Their struggles at Old Trafford are particularly revealing.",
      "No club fears the Theatre of Dreams anymore, but where Amorim's side have struggled most of all is in making the running against inferior teams at home, when the onus is on them to dictate pace and tempo. They have been too slow, too easy to defend against, and too simple to pick off.",
      "In the space of six months, Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham have won at Old Trafford in the Premier League. That is a truly wretched record. The only teams United have beaten at home in the Premier League in that time are Southampton and Ipswich, and neither was easy.",
      "It's too easy an excuse to bury heads in the sand and point out that Amorim just doesn't have the players to make it work. That is a simplistic excuse and frankly, an embarrassing one for an elite-level coach. He could have been adaptable, but even without changing the system, he should be performing better with the squad he has.",
      "On Sunday, Amorim suggested he could be fired if next season starts badly. The clock has certainly started ticking. The question for United is whether they retain enough faith to commit this summer's transfer budget to a system that a predecessor would tear up.",
      "United would improve under the Portuguese with more attacking wing-backs and a better striker. They would be more threatening with a creative playmaker.",
      "But would that solve the structural problems? And if the solution to raising that kind of money is selling Kobbie Mainoo or Alejandro Garnacho, is it worth the risk?",
      "Amorim retains the backing of United supporters. He has been an open, honest and critical communicator and has steered the club to a European final. But there are still questions that won't go away and doubts that are starting to grow."

      "United's 16th position in the Premier League and 17 defeats are unforgivable, regardless of their Europa League progress. The truest gauge of a team is their league form and United's has not been this appalling since people wore flares and listened to Slade.",
      "Amorim merits backing but, irrespective of whether United return from Bilbao with a new attraction for the club museum, the scrutiny on his position will be intense before each of those first three autumnal international breaks in the first third of next season.",
      "He admitted on Sunday that if the complacent culture continues to linger next season he should be sacked. Amorim has the matchgoers onside, so much so his name is chanted more regularly than any of the players.",
      "United supporters are often dignified in expressing their disapproval. It took a 4-1 humbling by Watford for them to specifically boo Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Vicarage Road. In front of the Sir Elton John Stand, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",
      "Separating the head coach from the players signals a vote of confidence for Amorim and a vote of no confidence for the majority of players. Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro are in the good books. All four have been serenaded recently. Amad is a firm fan favourite.",
      "Amad and Fernandes renewed their contracts in the last year, Maguire had his extended until 2026 and Yoro only arrived in July. Casemiro's Europa League pedigree has endeared him to supporters who appreciate his commitment and gutsiness after 18 months in decline.",
      "The purported poster boys of the new United, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, have had trying campaigns and the bond between academy starlets and supporters is not as ardent as it was a year ago. A rejected bid for Garnacho and a rejected contract by Mainoo have doubtless contributed. Both players' agents were sat among the United squad's family and friends in San Mames two weeks ago.",
      "As for the rest, fans would not kick up a fuss if the majority left. United acquired a dependable squad player in Noussair Mazraoui, Ayden Heaven showed promise before injury and Lisandro Martinez is an undeniable asset when fit.",
      "Then there are the frozen assets - those who freeze in the United shirt. Serie A remains a dumping ground for English clubs and United have to write off at least one of the £108.5million misfits Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Hojlund has eked three goals in 32 games and this is his second season. Zirkzee creditably rallied after his ignominious first-half substitution against Newcastle United but United are not going to get to where they aspire to be with him in the team. The two forwards bought from Europe's boot should be given the boot.",
      "Manchester City's dominance under Pep Guardiola was underpinned by them clearing the decks at full back in the summer of 2017. Bacary Sagna, Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy were released while Aleksandar Kolarov was sold. City invested £126.5m to recruit Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo.",
      "By City's sixth game of the 2017-18 season, Walker and Mendy had tallied more assists than Sagna, Zabaleta, Kolarov and Clichy had done between them in the previous campaign. Although Mendy succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury in City's eighth fixture, the die had been cast. Fabian Delph came in as an auxiliary left back and the front-footed approach had a profound effect on serial matchwinning wingers Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane.",
      "Walker is a City great. Mendy is not held in remotely similar esteem for obvious reasons and without him Guardiola reinvented the wheel at left back. Delph and then Oleksandr Zinchenko had successful stints out of position there. City have still not signed a recognisable left back since Mendy.",
      "United, meanwhile, still have a left back who joined 11 years ago. They are saddled with Luke Shaw, approaching the last two years of his contract. Victor Lindelof's outstayed welcome will end after eight years and the United hierarchy must have breathed a sigh of relief when they discovered that there was not a one-year option on Christian Eriksen's contract.",
      "Loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have to be shifted permanently. United may have a similar waiting game with Rashford to last summer's with Sancho, who joined Chelsea at the 11th hour. Europa Conference League finalist Antony is at least creating a market that should ensure his fee prevents United from making a loss on him under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "Casemiro's European form cannot hoodwink United. If they lose to Tottenham in Bilbao, no European football next season would effectively render Casemiro more redundant than some of the staff the club are letting go. The 33-year-old's revival has been restricted to the Europa League.",
      "Should Casemiro stay or go, Amorim would be sanguine. His perception of the Brazilian has altered drastically since the end of the winter transfer window. As instrumental as Casemiro was against Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Bilbao, hardly any clubs would stump up the £15m United require and match Casemiro's handsome £300,000-a-week salary.",

      "It was another disappointing domestic weekend for Ruben Amorim's side, as they suffered a 2-0 home defeat to West Ham in the Premier League. They will travel to Stamford Bridge next to take on Chelsea on Friday night before the crucial Europa League final on May 21.",
      "Off the pitch, work is already underway as Amorim prepares to oversee his first full summer transfer window. One of the key areas the club will look to strengthen is their attack, with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Matheus Cunha, Liam Delap, and Victor Osimhen all on their radar.",
      "Goodnight United fans!",
      "We'll have you covered for more United transfer news and gossip tomorrow!",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided against holding an end of season awards dinner at the end of the season.",
      "The club traditionally holds a gala dinner at Old Trafford each May as players across the teams receive awards. However, The Athletic have reported that the awards will be handed out on the pitch before the Premier League game of the season against Aston Villa.",
      "Manchester United co-owners the Glazer family could hand Sheikh Jassim the chance to launch a fresh takeover bid.",
      "The Americans will soon obtain the power to activate their drag-along rights, meaning the majority shareholders could force minority shareholders, such as Sir Jim Ratcliffe, to sell their shares when the majority sells their stake to a third party, according to The Athletic.",
      "It is claimed these drag-along rights will come into effect in around three months' time, which would mark 18 months since Ratcliffe's minority takeover of the club was finalised.",
      "This development could force Sheikh Jassim back to the negotiating table, with the Glazers potentially able to offer him the chance to push Sir Jim Ratcliffe to offload his shares unless he can match any incoming offers.",
      "Manchester United are the frontrunners to land Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap in the summer.",
      "Newcastle and Chelsea are also following the striker closely.",
      "Watford have announced the appointment of Paulo Pezzolano as their new head coach.",
      "The 42-year-old Uruguayan succeeds Tom Cleverley, who was sacked on May 6 following the Hornets' disappointing 14th-place finish in the Sky Bet Championship.",

      "Real Madrid are reportedly preparing to launch a bid for Benfica and former Manchester United left-back Alvaro Carreras.",

      "Bruno Lage, Benfica's boss, has publicly addressed the situation, saying: \"When I arrived here, Carreras was a flop and now Atletico and Real Madrid are interested.",
      "\"What is more important is what we think about the player. He is a player who has contributed to the team, who has been used the most by us, and I am pleased with him. He is very important to our dynamic (…) Regarding Carreras, I said he was a flop because I didn't know the player.\"",
      "Every dog has its day and Altay Bayindir's came against Arsenal at the Emirates in January.",
      "Bayindir started in the FA Cup third round against Arsenal and delivered a heroic performance, making crucial saves in normal time and saving two penalties in the shootout victory. The truth is Bayindir is below the level required to fill in for Andre Onana.",
      "He has conceded 18 goals in nine starts in all competitions this season and hasn't proven himself as a reliable back-up goalkeeper. The Turkish international was calamitous against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup in December. He had a night to forget and made mistakes, conceding four goals in London.",
      "Amorim bravely handed another chance to Bayindir against Arsenal in the FA Cup. Bayindir had already been responsible for United crashing out of a cup competition, so Amorim rolled the dice with his team selection, but at least he was able to deliver on the other side of North London.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Ruben Amorim has talked with the Man United board ahead of a huge transfer window.",
      "\"It's the way we face competition, the way we suffer, the way we get mad because we're losing and the way we protect the goal. These things we need to improve and sometimes it's just inside the pitch, it's outside the pitch.",
      "\"That feeling I'm talking about, fighting towards the end and facing competition, it's not ok to lose and it's not ok to draw. It doesn't matter if we can change our league position or not.\"",

      "The Ghanianian, who scored in both fixtures against United this season, has attracted interest after impressing at Bournemouth, netting nine goals and five assists in 35 league matches.",
      "Semenyo does not have a release clause but Bournemouth value him at £50million - a fee that would represent a huge deal of profit for the south coast club.",
      "Dan Ashworth is set to take a new job with the Football Association, according to the BBC.",
      "Ashworth made a shock departure from his position as Manchester United's sporting director in December, and he is set to take up his first role since his short tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "The 54-year-old is set to become the head of elite men's and women's development at the FA. Ashworth spent six years working for the FA as their director of elite development between 2012 and 2018, and part of his new role will be to oversee the development of homegrown coaches in England.",

      "Now, it has reported that Jose Mourinho has approved of a potential deal to take Sancho to Fenerbahce. The Super Lig club are in the market for a new winger with Allan Saint-Maximim heading back to parent club Al-Ahli at the end of his loan.",
      "Richard Keys has claimed that Ruben Amorim has \"all but resigned\" from his role as head coach at Manchester United with his comments after their 2-0 defeat against West Ham.",
      "\"I don't want to talk about the players,\" he said. \"I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. I have that feeling.",
      "\"We need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave. Because we cannot have a season like this next year. If the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "And beIN Sports broadcaster Keys believes such a stance vindicates his belief that Amorim is trying to get the sack.",
      "\"How long have I been saying Ruben Amorim has been trying to get the sack? You all laughed at me,\" Keys wrote in his latest blog.",
      "\"Well, now what? Because this weekend, he all but resigned. It's hard to interpret his post-match comments after the West Ham defeat any other way.\"",

      "Costa has told The National: \"So Antony lacked a little patience. He also went through a lot of messed up things. I know about family issues.",
      "\"So the kid's head was very messed up because he's very talented. Antony is very good, and look, now that he's happy, he's calm, he's having an impressive season. It's very easy to criticise from the outside, but as players, our heads count for a lot. If we're not clean, it ends up affecting the field.",
      "\"He had a very difficult problem behind him because of the accusation against him but now he's fine. He's calm. He's happy and confident. Look how he's doing at Betis. If he carries on like this he's a player who’s going to be there to play in the World Cup.\"",
      "Manchester United are expected to keep Ruben Amorim as head coach next season even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham, according to The Guardian.",
      "Amorim has endured a mixed time at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting CP and replacing Erik ten Hag in November. The Portuguese has won just six and drawn six of his 25 Premier League matches in charge - a run that has seen them drop down to 16th in the table.",

That’s what it’s really about, man flu,\" he said, speaking on the Rio Ferdinand presents YouTube channel.",
      "\"I had a mad virus, bro. I thought lights were out at some point, I thought it was gonna happen. I thought I was minutes away from lights out, seriously. I was in my house, I was in my bed like this [pained expression] and I couldn’t even open my eyes.",

      "Gary Pallister believes the current Man United squad has not done Ruben Amorim any favours as he tries to turn the club's misfortunes around.",
      "\"I think we have to wait to see what kind of stamp he put on it,\" Pallister told Betway. \"I think it’s very difficult to judge him this year with the team he’s got.",
      "\"He's tried to change it to his own style and his own tactics, and as of now, that’s not worked. He needs to bring in players that will be more comfortable in the system, and bring more character into the side.",
      "\"So, I think we’ve got to give him the amount of time that he deserves, and I think any manager would deserve, but he's only going to get a certain time now and in the next season before people do start judging him.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has come under pressure after another dismal defeat. The Reds were beaten for the 17th time in the Premier League this season, following a 2-0 defeat against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "Amorim has endured a mixed time at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting CP and replacing Erik ten Hag in November. The Portuguese has won just six and drawn six of his 25 league matches in charge - a run that has seen them drop down to 16th in the table, one point ahead of Tottenham in 17th.",
      "However, it's not been all doom and gloom for United since Amorim joined. In the Europa League, United have been excellent, and have won nine and drawn five of their 14 fixtures in that competition.",
      "They face Tottenham in the final of Europe's second tier competition next Wednesday, having beat Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club de Bilbao to reach this stage of the tournament.",
      "Manchester United are expected to keep Ruben Amorim as head coach next season even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham, according to The Guardian.",
      "There has been talk that, considering their dire Premier League form, Amorim could face the sack if United lose the Europa League final against Spurs and are denied Champions League football next season.",
      "However, that is reported not to be the case, with Amorim set to keep his job regardless of the result against Ange Postecoglou's side in Bilbao. The United board feel that Amorim deserves the summer transfer window to improve his squad and sign players more suited to his system.",
      "Manchester United will review Ruben Amorim's position this summer, even if he wins the Europa League, according to The Mirror. The move comes after Amorim put extra pressure on himself after suggesting he might not be the right man for the job following their defeat against West Ham.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and the rest of the club's board will assess Amorim's role at the end of the season.",
      "Even if United beat Tottenham in next Wednesday's Europa League final to secure Champions League football, Amorim's position is set to be evaluated following a dire league campaign and his post-match comments.",
      "Ruben Amorim's job at Manchester United is safe, regardless of the result in the Europa League final, as per talkSPORT. United insiders insist that the club are preparing for the long-haul with Amorim.",
      "It's claimed that Amorim will be backed in the summer with a deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha advanced and confidence is growing regarding a potential move for Ipswich Town's Liam Delap.",
      "\"Our position [16th in the table] is unacceptable. For me, that is not a lack of confidence, it's something more profound, and I talk with the board and with everybody, even with the fans, in every moment. I have a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"That helps me to maintain that level of not going down too much, or so high in some moments\"."

      "Manchester United coach Adam Lawrence has left his position as Under-18 manager.",
      "Sources have said Lawrence is open to working in a first-team environment or a fresh academy challenge for the next step of his career. The 39-year-old has been offered roles in English Football League first-team coaching set-ups and is currently weighing up his next move ahead of the new season.",
      "Lawrence's departure is unrelated to the club-wide redundancies and sources close to the coach say he is happy to work anywhere geographically after spending four years in Manchester.",
      "In a statement, Lawrence said: \"It has been a privilege to work for Manchester United. It has been a very special few years with this group; I’ve been fortunate to work with many of this season’s Under-18s right through from the Under-16s level and witness their growth as people as well as players.",
      "“During the last two years, all the staff across the Professional Development Phase can be very proud of the work we have done to support the players. The style of play, the focus on individual development and the culture of the academy that we have supported; it has been a real privilege to play my part in helping the group.",
      "“I’m now ready for the next challenge but I’ll always cherish the memories made at this great club and can’t wait to see what the future holds for the players I’ve had the pleasure of working with.”",
      "Head of the academy, Nick Cox, said: \"Adam has contributed greatly to our club throughout his four years at Manchester United. His passion for helping young players to maximise their potential has played an important role in the success of our academy system.",
      "“We take great pride in supporting and witnessing the development of our staff, Adam is a fine example of that, moving up from the Under-16s to the Under-18s, enjoying success and now being ready to seek a new challenge in the game.",
      "“The whole of the academy thanks Adam for his service and wishes him the very best of luck for the future.\"",
      "Lawrence was appointed as an Under-16 coach in January 2021 before being promoted to head of player development for the Under-13 to U16 age groups. He was subsequently appointed as U18 boss in the summer of 2023.",
      "Lawrence oversaw a treble with the U18s last season, winning two trophies at the expense of rivals Man City, and he targeted winning the prestigious FA Youth Cup in this campaign.",
      "However, the U18s were knocked out by Aston Villa at Villa Park on penalties in the Youth Cup semi-finals at the end of March. Villa went on to win the competition against Manchester City.",
      "The U18s have finished second in the Premier League North this season. Lawrence has been praised for his contribution to the U18s and leaves United with the best wishes of the club.",
      "It's understood talks are already under way to find a suitable replacement for Lawrence."

      "The 25-year-old is currently on loan at Stamford Bridge after joining Enzo Maresca's men late in the summer transfer window. After an impressive start to life in London, he has struggled to make an impact on the pitch.",
      "In 40 games for the Blues, the England international has scored four goals and assisted 10, but he has managed just two goals and four assists in 2025. There is an obligation to make Sancho's loan move a permanent one in the summer for £25million, but there are serious doubts over that going through.",
      "It's understood that Chelsea can escape the permanent transfers if they pay a £5m penalty to United. Earlier this week, The Mirror reported that they were ready to say goodbye to the former Borussia Dortmund winger in the summer.",
      "A return to Germany has been touted for Sancho but it has now emerged that a different exit route could be presented to him. According to Turkish outlet Yeni Asir, Fenerbahce are attempting to sign Sancho to bolster their attack for next season.",
      "The Yellow Canaries have conceded the Super Lig title this season to rivals Galatasaray and Jose Mourinho's side are expected to push for big names for next term. The report states that a deal worth £25m is being considered after Mourinho approved the deal.",
      "United are claimed to now value Sancho at less than £20m with his reported £250,000-per-week wage demands expected to be a stumbling block in any deal. A move to Fenerbahce would see Sancho reunited with ex-United midfielder Fred, who joined Mourinho at the Ulker Stadium in 2023.",
      "Turkey has welcomed some high-profile names in recent years with Victor Osimhen, Youssef En-Nesyri, Sofyan Amrabat, Davinson Sanchez, Milan Skriniar and Allan Saint-Maximin all making moves in recent years."

      "Now or never was the message when Manchester United came knocking on Ruben Amorim's door last October.",
      "After making the decision to sack Erik ten Hag less than 24 hours after a 2-1 defeat to West Ham United at the London Stadium, United earmarked Amorim as their top target to replace the Dutchman at Old Trafford.",
      "United moved swiftly to get a deal in place, paying €10million (£8.3m) to trigger his Sporting Lisbon release clause.",
      "Amorim had put Sporting back on the map, winning two Primeira Liga titles in three seasons after the club previously gone 19 years without being top dog in Portugal. Sporting's style of play was also attractive to United, with club bosses hopeful he would be able to revolutionise the Reds' fortunes with a new-look style.",
      "However, Amorim was hesitant about making the move there and then, informing United that he wanted to wait until the summer to become United's next permanent head coach. He had already informed Sporting of his plan to leave the club at the end of the season.",
      "United, though, were not willing to take no for an answer and Amorim had to make a life-changing decision there and then.",
      "\"The season started, we started very well, and then Manchester United came, they pay above the compensation clause and the president defends the club's interests,\" Amorim explained back in November.",
      "\"I never discussed anything with the president. For three days I said I wanted to stay until the end of the season, but then I was told it was not possible.",
      "\"It was now or never, or Manchester would go for another option. So, I had three days to make my mind up, to make a decision that changes radically my life.\"",
      "On reflection, it is easy to understand why Amorim wanted to take charge at United ahead of the start of a new season, getting the opportunity to oversee a full pre-season and start afresh. Instead, he has overseen 14 defeats in his first 39 games in charge.",
      "He said in February: \"When you start a season it's completely different [how] you feel things, have pre-season and time to change things you feel are necessary in a team and a squad, that is clear.",
      "\"That was the choice so I don't want to talk about that. I had my reasons to ask for it and I have the most important reasons to accept the job. I knew it would be tough and a risk but it's Manchester United and you can't say no.\"",
      "Of course, the fact Amorim has led United to the Europa League final cannot be ignored, and nor should it. He deserves credit for leading the club to their first European final since 2021.",
      "However, if they are on the losing side against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao next week, it will count for nothing. Their Premier League campaign has been nothing short of embarrassing, with the defeat to West Ham leaving them 16th in the table with two games to go.",
      "Defeats to Chelsea and Aston Villa either side of the final would see United end their Premier League campaign having lost half of their 38 matches. For a club of United's size, there is no escaping that.",
      "Amorim inherited an expensively-assembled squad in November, still fresh from five new additions being added to it last summer, but its profile, as the last few months have highlighted countless times, is not wedded to Amorim's philosophy.",
      "Only come the summer transfer window will Amorim get the chance to make just some of the necessary changes. It will be impossible for every change that needs to happen to take place in one window.",
      "It is unfair to judge Amorim until he has had a meaningful opportunity to build his own squad, with only Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven being signed since he was appointed, but he is not a position where he is immune from criticism.",
      "He has won just 24 points from 25 Premier League games in charge, with ten of them being amassed against the three relegated clubs, highlighting just how poor United's league form has been in recent months.",
      "It was clear from his initial hesitation about taking the job mid-season that he was conscious the timing wasn't right for him to come in and make an immediate impact, referencing the importance of pre-season. He will get the opportunity."

Unfortunately, the United players did not have that excuse to hide behind on Sunday as they slipped to their 17th defeat of the season.",
      "West Ham were in as rotten form as United, but Graham Potter managed to mastermind a victory over Amorim's team in a game which the hosts dominated on every statistic bar the one that matters. Just Chelsea stand in United's way now before that season-defining clash with Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "A victory over Spurs and United could count the season's objective as being completed. Lose, and there is nowhere to hide.",
      "Regardless of the result in the Basque Country, one matter that can't be hidden by Europa League glory is the substantial prize money loss that United will take from their league position. The exact figures for 2024/25 have not been confirmed yet, the Premier League often makes these figures public knowledge at the end of the campaign.",
      "However, they are likely to be similar to last season, which saw each position earn £2.8m more than the position below them. After a disappointing campaign that saw United finish eighth, they bagged a respectable £36.4m.",

      "However, that does not alter the stain that would be left on the finances this season. In a best case scenario, United could still finish as high as 13th which would bag them £22.4m based on last season's figures.",
      "But for that to happen, they would need to beat Champions League chasing Chelsea with a heavily rotated squad and Aston Villa. So that seems unlikely.",
      "More concerningly, if Spurs can pick up one extra point in their next two matches in comparison to United, the Reds will finish an embarassing 17th and will take home just £11m in prize money.

      "“What we’re hearing this afternoon is that Manchester United are in pole position to sign him. One source has even told us that he believes the deal is very close and that the player would be happy to move to Manchester United, even though United aren’t having a great season.

      "“Obviously, the top, top players have other options, but lots of clubs are interested in signing Liam Delap — Chelsea, for example. Potentially Nottingham Forest as well.",
      "“But I think it’s interesting that United are currently in pole position, and we believe the player would be happy to move there. Although, I think maybe we should wait and see what happens in the Europa League final next week.",
      "“I think United will be able to pay his release clause anyway. It’s £30million, which, in the grand scheme of things for top clubs — even in the PSR era, even if you’re not in the Champions League — United should be able to afford.",
      "“But I think from a player’s perspective, it might be wise to wait and see what happens over the next few days. For instance, whether Chelsea are going to be in the Champions League, and whether Manchester United will be. But I think, regardless of that, I get the feeling the player would be up for moving to United, even if they don’t make the Champions League.”",

      "“I went to talk to the referee, but I think the referee today could not do much more. He gave a goal. (The VAR officials) didn’t give him the chance to see the images again. What is he going to do? He took the right decision. He dealt quite well with the game, I think. He cannot do much more. It’s obvious he’s not the one that has made a mistake today,” he said.",

I don’t know what we have to do to change something but obviously it’s costing us a lot. We haven’t won on Sunday because of VAR and we are out of the cup because there is no VAR,” he said.",

      "“I think it was clear what happened, I asked for an offside and for VAR but they think I asked for a yellow card and it wasn’t even a foul for Liverpool. Probably they understand why but they cannot accept any appeal for yellow cards they told me, so I will be upstairs, yes,” he said of his suspension.",
      "Fourth booking\nTottenham (December 8) – shown a yellow card by Michael Salisbury in the 30th minute for dissent after a penalty was not given against Dara O’Shea for a perceived foul on Justin Kluivert.",
      "“There’s a penalty to Justin. We continue and hit the post but the first official says, ‘No, it’s a penalty but we decide to give the advantage.’ If it’s a penalty it’s a penalty, you know? The advantage has to be not super, super, super clear. Luckily for us it didn’t cost us in the end,” he said.",

      "“I was booked because I was complaining about the tackle against Joel. For me, of course we can mistake that in the Premier League that it’s a yellow card but I think nobody can complain if it’s a red. Not because of the foul but it’s more like the way he’s going into the duel,” he said.",
      "Second booking\nNottingham Forest (September 22) – shown a red card by Robert Jones in the 87th minute for entering the field of play without the referee’s permission after Morgan Gibbs-White was sent off for a foul on Joao Pedro. The touchline ban was later rescinded following a discussion with PGMOL head Howard Webb, although he was fined by the FA for acting in an improper manner.",
      "“I know what the fine will be and I also know that I will be on the sideline against Chelsea. I also have to learn out of this situation, how fast you can get a red card here in this league. But, of course, the fine we will accept. If you give a red card for this, you have to ban a lot of coaches during the games because in an emotional situation of the game it will happen that you make a step on the pitch. Of course we are role models and we have to act like this. But I think sometimes you also should bring out your emotions. In this case it was to protect Joao Pedro because it was a hard tackle on him. If I don’t show emotions there, me as a player, I would say, ‘the coach isn’t interested in me’, so that’s why I try to show emotions in some part of the games,” he said.",
      "Third booking\nSouthampton (November 29) – shown a yellow card by Robert Jones in the 31st minute for dissent after Kyle Walker-Peters was booked for a foul on Georginio Rutter.",
      "“You have to be very careful what you say in England. My yellow card is something that I cannot understand and I have to adapt to this here. How you talk to each other (on the touchline) is so important and that’s how I’ve been educated,” he said.",
      "Fourth booking\nAston Villa (December 30) – shown a yellow card by Craig Pawson in the 37th minute for dissent after complaining about the decision to award Villa a penalty for a foul on Morgan Rogers, having felt that Bart Verbruggen was impeded from a corner beforehand.",
      "“In the end, you can give the penalty but you can’t not give the foul on Bart. When it continues like this, you see it every weekend the blocking goalkeeper – if the Premier League doesn’t find a clear rule it will end in a different sport. In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer. It can be part of the game, but it should be a clear rule as to what is allowed and what isn’t. When it happens during the game you always get a foul in the midfield if you’re blocked, so why not blocked on a set-piece?” he said.",
      "Fifth booking\nNottingham Forest (February 1) – shown a yellow card by Simon Hooper in the 58th minute for dissent after a clash of heads between Nikola Milenkovic and Danny Welbeck.",
      "“Being emotional is part of it. I know the statistic, but in the end, emotions are part of the game. When we look at the decisions today, they were really poor. I have to deal with it, deal with the pressure and the disappointment. I will try and be a role model in the case of finding the right solutions. That is my job now,” he said.",

      "“It’s not a problem, this amount of yellow cards. It is what it is. I complained about a foul on Wesley Fofana which for me was quite clear but it can happen. Eight yellow cards probably because these sort of games are about duels and fight and this can happen. Sometimes the game demands the way you have to behave,” he said.",

      "“I was very happy, first of all because it’s a nice feeling to win the game at the end but I think it was a moment for the players because they deserve to share that moment with the fans. So this is the reason why I left the pitch immediately and then when we scored the second one I celebrated and this is the reason why they gave me a yellow card. But for sure I think it was a nice moment for the players and for the fans to share that moment,” he said.",
      "Fourth booking\nNewcastle (May 11) – shown a yellow card by John Brooks in the 39th minute for dissent after complaining about a decision which went Newcastle’s way shortly after Nicolas Jackson’s red card.",

      "“I think everybody in the stadium would have been booked if the referee could have got around to it. I’ve just accepted that the refereeing is where it is. The key message to us was that the threshold for tackles and duels, in this beautiful English game that we love, was going to be raised. I can remember it clearly. And then we get that,” he said.",
      "Second booking\nArsenal (September 28) – shown a yellow card by Sam Barrott in the 21st minute for dissent after a perceived foul on Jamie Vardy by William Saliba in the build-up to Arsenal’s first goal.",
      "“We were very disappointed with a foul not being given on Vards for the first goal. And although we don’t come into games trying to get players sent off, why he hasn’t sent off Calafiori is a little bit beyond belief. Because of the spell we’re in and the spell that I’m in personally, I’m trying to not let referees’ decisions be the headline, as I’m trying to take responsibility for a team that needs to get better results. But we feel those were two poor decisions,” he said.",
      "Third booking\nManchester United (October 30) – shown a yellow card by Andy Madley in the 32nd minute for dissent after complaining about a perceived offside in the build-up to Alejandro Garnacho’s goal.",
      "“Maybe there’s a bit of sympathy for the linesman. He’s a Premier League linesman and he’s used to the protection of VAR. But he can’t make a mistake like that. It was a big moment in the game. We score soon after and it should be 1-1. It’s 2-1. The referee’s enjoyed giving me a yellow card as well. He looked like he had a good time tonight. That was that. But I want to stand up for my team. You can’t just see an image on the bench and just accept it,” he said.",

      "First booking\nChelsea (October 20) – shown a yellow card by John Brooks in the 26th minute for dissent after complaining about a series of decisions which went against Liverpool.",
      "“The booking came from the fact that, I think there were three or four decisions that didn’t go in our favour. So it was a handball, I don’t know if it was, but everybody was screaming for it, so I did as well. Then there was the red card situation, then there was the penalty situation just afterwards. So there were a few things going against us, and I think sometimes you cannot hold your emotions, and that’s what you saw with me as well. He deserved to give me a yellow card. He should have given me, which he did. I deserved it. I have to put it like this,” he said.",
      "Second booking\nArsenal (October 27) – shown a yellow card by Anthony Taylor in the 72nd minute for dissent after complaining about a series of decisions which went against Liverpool.",
      "“Last time, I said I completely deserved the yellow card. This time I don’t think I did. So many times they were on the floor, which can happen in football, I don’t blame them for that. But they always fell down after they had ball possession and that took the energy out of the game in my opinion. I said to Ibou Konate, ‘This is a f**king joke.’ The fourth official thought I said to him: ‘You are a f**king joke.’ That’s definitely not what I said. I got a yellow for that so now I’m on two and I have to be careful,” he said.",
      "Third booking\nFulham (December 14) – shown a yellow card by Tony Harrington in the 57th minute for dissent after complaining about Curtis Jones being booked for a foul on Alex Iwobi.",
      "“There were a few moments when I could have been given a yellow card. It’s an emotional game and we were a man down, it’s frustrating. It’s good to see our performance after so many setbacks. It’s difficult to judge for me because I only see it in real-time like the referee. We have to accept what VAR sees. You know how important these decisions can be. We ended up with a draw and I don’t think we can blame the referee for that,” he said.",
      "Fourth booking\nEverton (February 12) – shown a red card by Michael Oliver after the game for persistent foul and abusive language after Everton’s late equaliser; Abdoulaye Doucoure and Curtis Jones were also both sent off after the final whistle.",
      "“I won’t go into details. I think what happened was the extra time ended up being eight. It happens a lot. The emotions got the better of me, if I look back I would love to do it differently. There is an ongoing process and I will respect that. Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions. That is definitely what I did,” he said.",

When my player is sprinting one-on-one with the goalkeeper and someone pushes from behind, it’s almost impossible…it’s difficult to accept how the decision on the field was like that. It was clear for me and for you. We have to respect the decision but it had a massive impact in the game. If it’s a penalty, he should’ve been sent off, he didn’t try to play the ball. In that moment it’s a clear penalty and a clear red card,” he said.",

That [Jones initially signalling that Gibbs-White had won the ball] was the mess. But let’s hope they improve and we continue. I don’t want to see it as a problem.

It was expected that the players would take some time getting used to the manager’s 3-4-2-1 system, but either they are just not intelligent enough or Amorim is failing to get his message across. Possibly both. Regardless, this is a terrible look on the man tasked with turning United around…",

      "Perhaps most alarmingly for Amorim, things aren’t getting better as the players get to grips with his system. They’re getting worse.",
      "If United’s current form was stretched throughout the season, they would be Championship-bound. They haven’t won in the league since March 16, eight games ago. Indeed, their last victory over a club who hasn’t been relegated was on January 26. With Champions League chasers Chelsea and Villa left to play, there is a very real possibility that United could go the last four months of the season without a single league win.",

      "PL POSSESSION TABLE 👇",
      "So, what the f*** are United doing with the ball?",
      "Not scoring many goals, obviously. Relegated sides aside, only Everton have scored fewer. The Red Devils are not creating an abundance of big chances – in that metric, they rank 12th – but with the opportunities they do make, they are appallingly wasteful. They have scored 40 goals from an xG of 49.4. Only Palace are performing worse in that respect. So Amorim could say that things ought to be better if they finished their chances, but he seems to recognise that he would be fooling no one.",
      "In open play, United’s attack looks especially impotent. All that money spent on attackers, plus the supposedly prodigious talent brought through the academy, and they’ve scored 21 open play goals fewer than a generationally-bad Tottenham…",

At one point, they had gone 23 matches without scoring a first-half goal from open play. Even Southampton, the team currently celebrating not being the Premier League’s worst ever, have held more half-time leads.",

It doesn’t matter where Arsenal’s 50% win rate would put them in any other league because they play in the Premier League, and in a season when they were understandably latterly distracted by a Champions League run that took them to the semi-finals, they have only needed 69 points to qualify for the Champions League.

      "However, a report from FourFourTwo suggests that the Red Devils’ attention is in fact not on the Newcastle man, and they will instead look at cheaper options in the summer.",
      "It would seem unlikely, anyway, that Tonali would ditch Newcastle for United. Both clubs may have Champions League next season, but upon this season’s evidence – currently third in the Premier League – they’ll be much more competitive in England than 16th-placed United.",

      "Here then, are our 10 demands for the remainder of the season. Ten things we want to happen because they will be amusing, annoying, annoyingly amusing or amusingly annoying. Or all of the above.",
      "",
      "Tottenham or Man United win the Europa League\nGenuinely incredible effort from these two banter powerhouses to have set this up so perfectly that it is now unavoidable. The two worst Premier League teams that won’t get relegated also find themselves in the final of a competition that rewards its winner with a place in the Champions League.",
      "This is guaranteed to be the most piss-boiling final ever staged, annoying Arsene Wenger in particular more than anything except an offside law that isn’t completely insane.",
      "Whoever wins here, everyone else loses. But especially the team that actually loses. These are now the most outrageous pair of high-wire seasons that we can ever recall, one of which ends in incredibly irritating success and one of which goes down as the worst Big Six campaign by an astonishing margin.",
      "We keep changing our mind over which outcome is funnier. Gut feel says that keeping Spurs trophyless while Man United get worse and worse while winning better and better trophies each year is the stronger bit, but as the final draws closer we start to see the charms of the alternative.",
      "Spurs finally winning a trophy when they are objectively, measurably worse than at any time across the drought – up to and including having two points from eight games almost immediately after their last trophy – is undeniably funny. And we are a million per cent here for the ‘Ange has had a better season than Arteta, actually’ discourse that follows even as Spurs sack him anyway because, you know, actual 17th place.",
      "Don’t overlook that element. Ruben Amorim might decide United has all been a terrible mistake and walk away, but he’s not going to get the sack win or lose. Postecoglou probably gets the sack either way, and that’s extraordinary in itself.",
      "The chance for Postecoglou to add his name to the roll of honour that is Tottenham’s Premier League era trophy-winning managers – George Graham, Juande Ramos, er, that’s it – is simply too delicious to dismiss out of hand.",

      "The Europa League winner finishes 17th\nVery important, this, and another tick against Tottenham’s name. It’s greedy, because 16th is quite a funny finishing position for a Champions League qualifier, but it’s not really any funnier than, say, 13th or 15th is it?",
      "Maybe it’s just us, but 17th definitely feels funnier. Seventeenth has a different feel to those other sh*t finishing positions. It has peril. Jeopardy. Obviously there has never actually been any real peril thanks to the antics of that bottom three, but finishing one place above the relegation zone adds an extra frisson to the lore we can create around the achievement.",
      "And years from now, absolutely nobody will care that the gap was actually 15 points or whatever. One place above relegation is the fact, and right now – on the basis that neither Spurs nor Man United look capable of, or even particularly interested in, winning any more Premier League points, it nudges us towards favouring Spurs in Bilbao and trusting them to (not) do the business domestically against Villa and Brighton.",
      "We do understand – and broadly agree with – the way Spurs and United have both prioritised the Europa League since the knockouts began. It was a sound judgement choice from both given the already ropey place they found themselves in the league.",
      "But we really don’t think they necessarily had to commit so very hard and make it so very obvious. We are, though, delighted they did.",

      "Arsenal have only a two-point lead over Newcastle, who they face on Sunday. All we need is for Newcastle to win their last two games of the season and this one is in the bag.",
      "Of course Gunners will then start insisting they were never in a title race actually because there hasn’t actually been one and actually the real failure is City falling off actually, but nobody listened to Spurs fans saying this kind of sh*t in 2016 and nobody will listen to Arsenal fans now.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace win the FA Cup\nIt struck us very hard indeed on the weekend as Spurs and United both apparently had no choice but to continue their dirty protest Premier League seasons because there’s a Europa League to be won in 10 days’ time that one of them was completely pantsed by a team who have the FA Cup final in less than a week and yet still somehow felt willing and able to turn in a passable league performance.",
      "From the moment all the other big guns departed the scene alarmingly early, there has been widespread expectation that Man City would very boringly go ahead and win it to smarten up their unexpectedly tricky season of (relative) strife in the larger competitions.",
      "Very funny, then, if that in fact does not happen. And simply magnificent that we have the very real prospect now of a season where both Spurs and Newcastle end their absurd respective trophy droughts yet get upstaged – in scale of achievement if not coverage – by Palace winning their first major trophy ever. With all due respect to the 1991 Zenith Data Systems Cup.",
      "We certainly await with great interest the gushing broadsheet thinkpieces the following day fansplaining away about how if you didn’t weep tears of joy at the sight of Palace’s magical win and immediately pledge to name your first-born son Selhurst in their honour that you simply don’t get association football.",

      "Isak nipping in to pinch the trophy with a pair of season-closing hat-tricks would be entertaining enough even without the fact one of them comes against Arsenal and thus has enough rocket-fuelled narrative to get us all through the summer. Win-win.",

Nobody has paid any attention and, beyond the neatness of becoming the first club to complete the full set of major European trophies living and dead, nobody will really pay any heed to Chelsea winning it.",
      "But Chelsea not winning it? Now there’s an event. Especially if United have won the Europa League final and Antony thus walks away from this season with winners’ medals in both the Europa League and Conference League to somehow prove the haters both completely wrong and absolutely right in one late twist.",

      "Qualifying for Europe was so far beyond even a stretch target for Forest at the start of the season, yet it would now feel like something very close to actual failure. That’s not remotely fair, but none of this is fair. Football isn’t fair. Life isn’t fair.",
      "Then there’s the added noodle-scratcher of whether it would actually be better to land in one of the lesser competitions.",
      "Fast forward a year from now and Forest could be getting ready for a Europa Conference final and thinking how lucky they were not to accidentally qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Of course being in the Champions League is a huge deal and elevates a club to a new level and opens new doors – see Aston Villa’s January dabbles in the loan market for evidence of just how transformative it can be – but what if it is actually more fun to end up like Spurs or Chelsea in a tournament you actually have a chance of winning as long as the sheer weight of Antony’s banter-magnetism isn’t too great?",

      "These six players could all be on the move this summer – three are basically confirmed departures, and Kevin De Bruyne is certain to leave Man City. We reckon Arsenal should be taking a serious look…",
      "",
      "Antony (Manchester United)\nWhat would have seemed a completely insane suggestion a few months ago is now something several big clubs might seriously consider. On loan from Manchester United to Real Betis, Antony has been on fire, helping the La Liga side reach the Europa Conference League final, where they will face Chelsea on May 28.",
      "But in the Premier League, Antony has been one of the worst signings ever. Only Alexis Sanchez’s miserable swap deal with Henrikh Mkhitaryan ranks lower among Manchester United transfers in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. And when it comes to £70million-plus Premier League signings, he’s second-last again in a diabolical list of flops.",
      "Yet there’s a chance the spinning Brazilian could still come good in England – not for United, but perhaps for someone else.",
      "The Red Devils played a blinder by sending Antony on loan to Spain in January. Before his resurgence at Betis, it was widely accepted that £15million would be a generous fee for someone who cost £65m more. Now there’s genuine hope United could recoup closer to £40m – still a colossal loss, but decent damage limitation.",
      "No one expects Mikel Arteta or Andrea Berta to spend too long pondering a move for Antony – and this isn’t a prediction that they will – but he’s shown he can thrive in the right environment, under the right management, and surrounded by competent footballers. Arsenal can offer all three, and if he’s willing to put the defensive work in, he could be a very handy back-up to Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nMartin Odegaard has been a little off the boil this season, and who better to ease the creative burden than a man who’s spent the last decade tormenting Arsenal?",
      "Obviously, wage demands and his injury record are two pretty major stumbling blocks when it comes to signing a player who’s clearly on the decline, but it’s Kevin De Bruyne, lads. He knows full well that the £400,000-a-week wages he earns at Manchester City aren’t going to be matched anywhere outside Saudi Arabia, and while MLS clubs might stretch to $300,000 per week, remaining at the top level still seems to be the Belgian’s main priority.",
      "With that in mind, Arsenal could be an ideal landing spot. We know all about his leadership, experience and winning mentality, but the fact is that KDB can still contribute. He still massively improves a Gunners squad that’s crying out for an X-factor signing – someone who could finally get them over the line in the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nHad Arsenal not made the pointless and panicky signing of Raheem Sterling, they might have thrown their hat in the ring for Marcus Rashford in the winter transfer window. He would have been exactly what Mikel Arteta was crying out for – and as someone who’s played plenty of football through the middle, he would have been a natural replacement for the injured Kai Havertz.",
      "Instead, Arteta was forced to chuck Mikel Merino up front, ignoring Gabriel Martinelli’s potential in that role. And with Bukayo Saka sidelined until March, there’s been a real lack of bite in the forward areas this year.",
      "Rashford – growing in confidence by the week at Villa Park before suffering a season-ending injury – has swiftly returned to something close to his terrifying best under Unai Emery, freed from the Old Trafford shackles just like Antony. He still has so much to offer, but once again, it comes down to wage demands and whatever fantasy figure United slap on him.",
      "At 27, there are legitimate questions over the logistics of any move – particularly given his wild inconsistency over the last few seasons – but honestly, you have to take the form of any Manchester United player with a hefty pinch of salt. As we’ve seen with Antony and Rashford this year, and Jadon Sancho in 2024, that club is bloody cursed.",
      "Rashford still has the potential to be a world-class forward. He just needs to get this summer move right, and Arsenal could be the perfect fit.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nNkunku scored a frankly ridiculous 58 goals and provided 29 assists in his final two seasons at Leipzig, earning a move to Chelsea.",
      "The Blues struck a deal to sign him before their spiral into chaos truly began. Had the Frenchman waited just a few more months, he might’ve ended up elsewhere – and kept hold of both his form and his reputation as an elite goalscorer.",
      "But he didn’t. And he hasn’t.",
      "Anyone who watched him tear it up in the Bundesliga knows there’s a top-class attacker in there somewhere, but signing Nkunku now carries an obvious degree of risk. Still, Arsenal do love a Chelsea cast-off – and at 27, Nkunku is a fair bit younger than most of the Stamford Bridge alumni they’ve taken on in recent years.",
      "📢 TO THE COMMENTS! Should Arsenal sign any of these six Premier League rejects? Have your say Below The Line…",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton)\nFerguson’s stock has fallen off a cliff, but under the right manager he could still realise his potential. If Arsenal do come calling, it’s likely to be either as a second striker signing or as their tenth-choice option – after being turned down by Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Jonathan David and half a dozen others.",
      "A loan spell at West Ham hasn’t had the desired effect, and Ferguson will return to Brighton for pre-season with a point to prove. Fabian Hurzeler appears content with Danny Welbeck leading the line and, while Welbeck remains a valuable player, he’s someone the young Irishman should be looking to usurp.",
      "A summer exit does feel somewhat inevitable. Arsenal will certainly keep an eye on things, and bringing him in alongside a marquee striker signing would be a statement of intent.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nNot quite a reject or an outcast, but certainly a player United would happily sell for some sweet, sweet pure profit.",
      "Arsenal need midfield reinforcements this summer, with Jorginho set to leave on a free. Martin Zubimendi is arriving from Real Sociedad for around £51million, and if Thomas Partey follows Jorginho out the door, another midfielder will be required.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo would command a hefty fee, but he’s one of the most promising young midfielders in Europe and would add much-needed dynamism and technical quality to an Arsenal midfield currently lacking both. Capable of playing as a No.6, 8 or 10, he fits the profile perfectly.",
      "United might baulk at the idea of selling to what they’d audaciously consider a ‘direct rival’, but if the right offer lands on the table, they’ll surely be tempted. PSR has been a real thorn in the Red Devils’ side, and the sale of an academy graduate would be a financial godsend.",
      "READ NOW: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim and Ange, Newcastle, Dias, Rusk, Beto, Jackson",

      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Monday 12 May 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim insists Man Utd are \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\" after admitting to being “embarrassed” about his side's lack of urgency amid their Premier League struggles.",
      "United returned to earth with a bump three days after reaching the Europa League final as fellow strugglers West Ham secured their first Premier League win at Old Trafford since 2007.",
      "Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored in a 2-0 triumph that meant United have now lost an eye-watering 17 top-flight matches this term, with nine of them coming on home turf.",
      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",
      "\"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',\" the United boss said.",
      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",
      "\"We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "Amorim then appeared to cast doubt over his own role at United he reiterated that United \"need to change a lot of things during the summer\" and acknowledged that could eventually lead to a change in the dugout, having overseen just six league wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Asked how he changes the players' attitude given his struggles to do so, he said: \"I don't know, and I don't want to talk about players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "\"If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "So poor have United been that he even suggested that Champions League qualification may be an issue.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final,\" he said. \"It's by far the smallest problem in our club. We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing that in the end of this season that playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon, so we need to know that.",
      "\"I'm not concerned about the final. They (the players) will be focused and I don't know what is best, if it's playing Champions League or not. So, let's think about Chelsea to improve a lot of things.\"",
      "Man Utd deserve to be in a relegation scrap.",
      "If you take the three relegated clubs out of the equation, Manchester United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games.",
      "They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and top-flight is so great, otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games, they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right-flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals. West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense."

      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",

      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.",
      "Surely but surely nobody can argue this is anything but a successful season.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",

      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League, which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams, is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "Every club that qualifies earns an automatic £15.7m - even if they lose every game and go out at the league phase.",
      "At that stage, every win earns a club £1.8m and a draw £590,000.",
      "For finishing in the top eight of the league phase, which seals automatic qualification to the round of 16, UEFA awards £1.7m to each team.",
      "Teams are also awarded £233,000 for each place in the league phase table, meaning Liverpool got £8.4m for finishing top, while Arsenal earned £7.9m for finishing third.",
      "UEFA then rewards teams for reaching each round of the knockout phase:",
      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",
      "Their run to the last four, where they were beaten by Paris Saint-Germain, earned them roughly £70m in prize money, and that is before factoring gate receipts and commercial revenues.",
      "The winner of the final between Paris-Saint Germain will earn close to £100m in prize money.",
      "For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer",
      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",
      "As we approach the end of the Premier League season, just seven points separate six teams fighting for the remaining places below champions Liverpool, whose place is already assured.",
      "Crucially, England's co-efficient score means the Premier League has five spots this season, rather than the usual four.",
      "Arsenal could clinch their place with victory over Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Man City, Newcastle and Chelsea currently occupying the other spots, and Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",
      "Both sides are in the bottom half in the Premier League and not in the conversation for a top-five finish, but the Europa League winners earn qualification to the Champions League.",
      "An English Europa League winner does not mean the fifth-placed Premier League team lose their Champions League place."

      "One of Man Utd and Spurs are guaranteed to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League - but are both clubs ready to take on that relentless workload next season?",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham are set to meet in the biggest ever footballing 'get out of jail free' stakes in Bilbao - but could winning the trophy actually be a curse?",
      "Quickly, pop that balloon.",
      "Turn the music down.",
      "Stop singing about Eric Cantona and Ledley King.",
      "No one likes a party pooper but let's get real and pour some cold water on the Bilbao party for a moment. This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League - which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams - is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "A run to the semi-finals earned Arsenal roughly £70m in prize money. For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer.",
      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",
      "Both clubs are in need of a reset. Another rebuild. A season of consolidation.",
      "Not having a Champions League campaign - and at least eight league-phase matches to negotiate - wouldn't be a bad thing.",
      "If Amorim and whoever oversees Spurs want to keep their jobs next season, the bread and butter of the Premier League will dictate matters in that regard.",
      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",
      "Just look what it did for Chelsea in 2016/17.",
      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",
      "Could those losers actually be the real winners?"

      "Manchester United are into the final of the Europa League as a 4-1 win over Athletic Club completed a 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",

      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",
      "Mount had never scored for United at Old Trafford before this game, his only previous goals for the club coming at Brentford. These two were special, the first because of its importance in the moment and the second enough to light up any evening.",

      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
