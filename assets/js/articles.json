      "WWE legend Wade Barrett has reignited his feud with Wayne Rooney, almost seven years after the England great slapped him in the face during an episode of Monday Night Raw",
      "WWE commentator Wade Barrett has reignited his feud with football icon Wayne Rooney by challenging the football legend to a showdown in the wrestling ring.",
      "The former five-time intercontinental champion is now a voice behind the WWE Smackdown's commentary desk. But he hasn't forgotten his infamous clash with the Manchester United hero during a Raw event in Manchester back in November 2015.",
      "Barrett had a heated exchange with Rooney and stepped out of the ring to confront the then-United skipper at ringside, only to be floored by a stinging slap from the footballers, reports the Manchester Evening News.",
      "Since that memorable night, Barrett, 43, has become one of wrestling's top commentators, while Rooney has taken the managerial reins at Championship club Plymouth Argyle.",
      "Barrett has now divulged why he didn't hit back after Rooney's slap. \"Wayne Rooney is lucky that he can afford better lawyers than I can,\" joked the WWE icon. \"That's what I'll say. I think we're a physical mismatch. I'm twice the size of Wayne Rooney.",
      "\"I think if I had responded at that moment, there would have been plenty of lawsuits coming my way. He was still an active player for England. He was still an active player for Manchester United and I'm sure whoever the managers were at that point in time would not have been very happy with Wade Barrett placing his hands on the English golden boy Wayne Rooney.",
      "\"A number of factors played in my head very quickly when I decided to not retaliate, but the financial aspect was probably the biggest one!\" Despite both having retired from their respective sports, Barrett is open to a one-off wrestling rematch, but only if he gets to face off against the England legend he confesses to being a \"huge fan\" of.",
      "\"I have told Wayne numerous times he has an open invite to come back to WWE,\" he declared. \"We are both way past our peak. We are both way past our sell-by date. I'm a huge fan of Wayne Rooney. I was the biggest supporter of him as a player right up there with Paul Gascoigne in terms of my all-time favourite England players.",
      "\"Brilliant player. No one could ever forget how amazing he was in 2004 in the Euros when he was ripping teams apart as this young 18-year-old prodigy.",
      "\"So, I'm a big fan of the guy and I don't want this to be turned into some immense hatred I have for him. But in terms of stepping into our world, no pal, I'm throwing you back out. So, if he did ever want to lock horns as two old washed-up men in the WWE ring, bring it on, Wayne.\"",

      "While Europe's attention turns to Euro 2024's finale this weekend when Spain and England face-off - clubs across the continent remain hard at work.",
      "The end of the international tournament leaves little in the way of excuses for transfers to face any delay and, with the start of the 2024/25 season creeping up, deals must be done. Manchester United are no different and will hope that Netherlands' exit can accelerate their moves for the likes of Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt as they look to make their first signings of the summer.",
      "Much improvement is required at Old Trafford following their worst ever Premier League finish last term. Erik ten Hag knows his side will have to improve after extending his contract.",
      "Mirror Football takes a look at some of the biggest transfer stories surrounding the side.",
      "The Bologna forward is set to be the first player added to United's squad this summer. The Red Devils have agreed terms for the Dutch international's arrival and now have a deal in place with Bologna to pay more than his release clause for a favourable payment plan.",
      "A £35.7million fee will be paid over three years and Zirkzee is expected to sign a five-year contract. The 23-year-old former Bayern Munich forward has one demand for his arrival however.",
      "It's reported that Zirkzee has asked to wear the No. 9 shirt vacated by Anthony Martial, whose contract expired at the end of last month. There could be competition for the shirt from Rasmus Hojlund who wears the number for Denmark.",
      "Reports suggest that United can only look to sign PSG central midfielder Manuel Ugarte, if they are able to sell Casemiro first. The position has been deemed a priority for the club this summer.",
      "Ugarte is said to be open to a move, despite no Champions League football on offer but United have seen a £38m bid turned down. They hope to pay no more than £45m.",
      "The club started the window with a budget of £50m, so with moves for Zirkzee and De Ligt on the horizon, players must also depart. Al-Ittihad are said to be in talks for Casemiro with United keen to see the back of the Brazilian's £350,000-per-week wages.",
      "Manchester United could have a difficult time persuading Bologna to part with another one of their stars after landing Zirkzee, but it may not prove impossible. A fee of £30m could prove enough to land Dan Ndoye",
      "Manuel Minguzzi, editor at Tuttobologna, told the Manchester Evening News: \"After Calafiori and Zirkzee, I don't think Bologna will give up a third starter. The management would not want to give him up and Ndoye is liked by new coach Vincenzo Italiano. In any case we are talking about £25-30m.\"",
      "Ndoye's agent Fahd Adamson has admitted a move could be on the cards. \"It is good that Manchester United are interested in Dan, and it is somehow logical as well,\" he said.",
      "\"United belong to INEOS, and Dan has already played for the other INEOS-owned clubs in Nice and Lausanne. He received countless WhatsApp messages from English clubs after the quarter-final against England. Let's see what emerges from them.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra has been given a suspended prison sentence after allegedly failing to pay his ex-wife almost £1million in alimony",
      "Former Manchester United and France football star Patrice Evra had been handed a suspended prison sentence for failing to pay close to £1million in alimony to his ex-wife.",
      "Judges in the Paris suburb of Nanterre ruled that Evra, 43, had effectively ‘abandoned’ Sandra Evra, 42, and their children – a boy who is now 19 and a girl, aged 10 – between May 1, 2021 and September 28, 2023.",
      "Lawyers for the footballer immediately appealed Tuesday’s verdict, which followed years of litigation. Evra, a multimillionaire following a hugely successful playing career, was alleged to owe his ex-wife a total of €969,000 (£814,000) in unpaid alimony.",
      "“The sentence was 12 months in prison, suspended for two years,” a prosecuting source at the Hauts-de-Seine Correctional Court said on Friday. “Mr Evra’s legal team immediately appealed.”",
      "Evra was also ordered to pay his ex-wife €4,000 (£3,360) for moral damages and €2,000 (£1,700) in legal costs.",
      "Nathalie Dubois, Ms Evra’s barrister, said: “I hope that, thanks to this decision, Patrice Evra will finally understand that he is not above the law and that we cannot abandon our wife and children overnight. Even more so when they met at the age of 15 and she followed him all over the world to support his football career.”",
      "Jérôme Boursican, for Mr Evra, insisted to Le Parisien that ‘the facts are disputed’ by his client. Mr Boursican said: “Mr. Patrice Evra appealed, knowing that he provided his wife with an apartment, a house with a swimming pool in the south of France and that he lent her almost two million euros for her daily life. A sum that she refuses to return, and this is the reason for this trial.”",
      "The Evras married in 2007, but divorce proceedings were instigated around 2020, when the former Manchester United, Juventus, and Marseille defender was pictured kissing Danish model Margaux Alexandra.",
      "Since then, Mr Evra and Margaux Alexandra have had two children of their own together, and are believed to be living in Dubai.",
      "Evra was born in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, and then moved to Paris as a young child. In 2020, Sandra Evra spoke publicly about the affair that finally led to divorce after 25 years together.",
      "She said their 'life long love story turned into a nightmare' and the man she once adored has turned into a 'bullying rat'. She said: “We had a wonderful family Christmas, an amazing holiday in the Maldives together and at New Year we kissed and cuddled together after spending a night as a family with our son and daughter.",
      "“Two days later he left our home in Paris to go to work in London saying he would be back two weeks later. And I have never spoken to him since. He has tried to cut me out of my life.",
      "“I saw photographs of him with another woman in London and then I got a call from my solicitor telling me that he wanted to divorce me. It was the worst day of my life. I was in shock, devastated, distraught.”",
      "The couple were just 15-years-old when they met at school in Les Ulis – the Paris suburb that has produced numerous Premiership stars - and Sandra describes the moment as 'love at first sight'.",
      "Sandra Evra decided to speak out after Mr Evra gave an interview in August 2020, saying that they only met at 'family moments' and were no longer 'sharing the same roof'.",

      "Jadon Sancho had a fallout with boss Erik ten Hag early last season, resulting in the Manchester United winger being banished from the first-team squad and loaned out to Borussia Dortmund",
      "Jadon Sancho has returned to first-team training at Manchester United after agreeing to bury the hatchet with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Sancho, 24, hasn't played for United since August 2023 following a much-publicised bust-up with the Red Devils boss. Ten Hag infamously called the £73million winger out during a press conference, criticising him for his displays in training ahead of United's 3-1 loss away to Arsenal back in September.",
      "In a subsequent social media post, Sancho effectively accused his manager of lying and refused to apologise, a stance which he maintained throughout the season, even after being banished from the first-team dressing room. The England international was loaned out to former club Borussia Dortmund in the January transfer window, helping them reach the Champions League final with a string of encouraging performances.",
      "Sancho has since been linked with a move away from Old Trafford but after a meeting with Ten Hag, he's now back in pre-season training. The Athletic also report that the ex-Manchester City academy star won't travel to Norway for United's friendly against Rosenberg but will be available thereafter.",
      "It's explained that during a meeting at their Carrington training base this week, Ten Hag agreed to draw a line under Sancho's past issues, with the pair agreeing to move on. United have given no indication whether the decision means that the 24-year-old is no longer available for transfer.",
      "The Red Devils were reportedly open to offers of around £40m, and although the club could still opt to get rid of Sancho before the summer window closes on August 30, his return implies that Ten Hag could look to use him in the new Premier League campaign, which for United begins at home to Fulham.",
      "The 24-year-old has largely underwhelmed since his long-awaited move from Dortmund three years ago. During Ten Hag's first season, Sancho spent time training alone in order to re-focus himself mentally and physically following a difficult first 18 months back in Manchester, having left City in 2017.",
      "Your turn! Should Jadon Sancho still look to leave Manchester United? Give us your verdict in the comments section.",
      "Ten Hag stood firm throughout last season as Sancho refused to apologise. Recently-departed United coach Benni McCarthy offered an insight into the situation in May by telling South African news outlet 947: \"I spoke to the manager and I said to him that you know the delicacy.",
      "\"I told him I think Jadon feels that if he apologises then he's going to be classed as someone who doesn't train hard, that doesn't work hard and that everything that was said against him was true.",
      "\"If you are from the streets, no one wants to apologise because then you're admitting you are not training well, you are lazy, everything you are accused of. Jadon wasn't going to have that. The manager just said that all he wants is an apology.\"",
      "McCarthy added: \"I spoke to Jadon as a coach, as a mentor, as a friend, and as someone who grew up on the streets and knows the code. But Jadon just wasn't seeing it. He said, 'I ain't apologising because if I do, I'm apologising for being lazy, always being late, not giving my best. That's what I'm apologising for'. And those were his reasons.\"",

      "His new role as an assistant to Ten Hag marks a return to the Red Devils for Van Nistelrooy. The former striker previously spent five years at the club as a player, scoring 150 goals in 219 appearances between 2001 and 2006.",
      "After retiring in 2012, he transitioned into coaching, rising up the ranks at PSV Eindhoven to take charge of their senior team in 2022. He left that role after only a year, though did win the KNVB Cup.",
      "While he has not worked in football since leaving his job as PSV boss, Ten Hag believes that experience can help him at United. The United boss also insisted that Van Nistelrooy's previous spell at Old Trafford can be a huge boost.",
      "“I think we did well. We achieved what we wanted to achieve, but we can’t sit still. We want to go forward and we are so pleased to get Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake in, to bring some new dynamic, to bring some new initiative and innovation,” Ten Hag said.",
      "“First of all, his character has brought him so far and it’s an example for everyone here in the building. Of course, he will also bring some DNA of Manchester United in, but that character is such a strong driver and that is also what he shows as a coach.",
      "“He has such a highly interesting profile, he’s so ambitious, he has the skills and he already has a lot of experience. He’s assisted the Dutch squad, in PSV he did the Under-19s as a manager, he did the Under-21s, Jong PSV, who were playing at the second level.",
      "\"Then he was manager of the first team. So much experience, but very young, very ambitious, very driven. With his skills and his intelligence, he will help all the players and the team.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy has also been welcomed to his new role by sporting director Dan Ashworth. The executive is hoping that his stunning record as a player at United can translate into success for the current team.",
      "“Together with Erik, we are working to strengthen all areas of our men’s first-team operations, and refreshing the coaching staff is an important part of that,\" Ashworth said.",

      "This is the formation United deployed for much of last season, but a few changes will take place should the three Dutchmen arrive. Despite a rocky debut campaign, Andre Onana will continue in goal.",
      "In defence, Diogo Dalot impressed at right-back and will keep that spot, while a fit-again Luke Shaw should be first-choice at left-back. If he does arrive, De Ligt would partner Lisandro Martinez in what would be one of the top-flight's best central defences.",
      "In midfield, Simons would likely partner Kobbie Mainoo in the holding position. Captain Bruno Fernandes was one of the few bright spots last term and will likely continue to play as the central attacking midfielder.",
      "On the wings meanwhile, Alejandro Garnacho has carved out a starting spot for himself. On the opposite wing, Zirkzee could well come in for Marcus Rashford, who endured a difficult campaign last term. And Rasmus Hojlund will look to build on a solid debut year up-front.",
      "Line-up: Onana; Dalot, De Ligt, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Simons; Zirkzee, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund",
      "A second option could be to use a 4-3-3 formation. That would see the same back five, with Onana in goal, Dalot at right-back and Shaw at left-back, with De Ligt partnering Martinez in central defence.",
      "The midfield would be tweaked slightly, with Fernandes dropping back between Mainoo and Simons. The forward line could see the biggest change, with Marcus Rashford coming into the team in place of Zirkzee.",
      "Width from the two wingers would be key, which would be the reason for Zirkzee dropping out. Garnacho would keep his place on the right wing, with Hojlund again going through the middle.",
      "Line-up: Onana, Dalot, Martinez, De Ligt, Shaw; Mainoo, Fernandes, Simons; Rashford, Hojlund, Garnacho",
      "If United are facing a team who are happy to sit in and defend in a low block, Ten Hag may need to go for a more attacking outlook. That could see United deploy a 3-5-2 formation to get as many attackers into the team as possible.",
      "Defensive solidity would come from a back three of De Ligt, Martinez and Shaw. At wing-back, but acting more as traditional wingers could be Garnacho and Rashford, who would certainly add attacking zeal out wide.",
      "A three-man midfield would again be made up of Mainoo, Simons and Fernandes. Crucially, this formation would also allow Zirkzee to partner Hojlund up-front as an out-and-out striker.",

      "Erik ten Hag's call to bring back Manchester United icon Ruud van Nistelrooy as part of his coaching staff has been branded 'smart' by Louis Saha.",
      "The striker, who scored 150 goals for United, has returned to the club to help his fellow Dutchman. And he arrived at Carrington on Monday to the jubilation of supporters.",
      "Despite lifting the FA Cup, Ten Hag's men looked a shadow of the Red Devils of old last season, finishing eighth in the Premier League. One reason for this was limited goalscoring. United's 57 goals in the league equalled Crystal Palace's total and was only one better than 16th-placed Brentford.",
      "Ex-United forward Saha believes that Van Nistelrooy's recruitment can improve United's goalscoring fortunes, citing the budding Rasmus Hojlund as someone who could benefit from the former marksman.",
      "Dutchman Van Nistelrooy's first spell at Old Trafford was an enjoyable one. Five years and over 200 appearances under Sir Alex Ferguson saw the striker win an array of trophies.",
      "Renowned for his striking instincts, the ex-Real Madrid man went down the coaching route upon retirement with former club PSV's academy and climbed the pecking order to become head coach for the 2022/23 season – in which his side scored 89 goals, topping the league in that category.",
      "According to former strike partner Saha, Van Nistelrooy's unique blend of goalscoring prowess and his ability to impart this talent to others makes him the ideal mentor for the raw Hojlund.",
      "Saha spoke to Gambling Zone, saying: “First of all, Ruud has become a complete manager and can create a style going forward but also across the field. He can definitely help this connection that has been missing between the forwards and midfield.",
      "\"When you have a striker like Rasmus Hojlund, it’s important to have a manager or a coach who knows exactly what he needs to get more opportunities.",
      "“Having Ruud van Nistlerooy will really help because I believe that he knows exactly what type of movement Hojlund needs and what type of positional sense he needs.",
      "“So I think it's a clever move for Erik ten Hag, bringing in a coach that will have a better understanding of what Hojlund needs to do as a striker. If he manages to distribute this information the right way to the attacking midfielders and how to create those one-on-one opportunities, we will see immediate improvement in results.",
      "“Last year there was so much frustration in terms of the body language of the players, I would go as far to say it was horrific. I’m a quiet guy but I would be going mad if I saw that type of thing, it doesn’t make sense for strikers.”",
      "Hojlund netted 16 times for United last campaign and has shown he perhaps has the potential to become a Van Nistelrooy-esque figure for Ten Hag’s forward line – and what better coach to help him reach that potential than the man himself?",
      "Compatriot Ten Hag was pleased to welcome both Van Nistelrooy, as well as former Go Ahead Eagles coach Rene Hake to the club, saying in a statement: \"I am delighted that Rene and Ruud have agreed to join our project, adding a wealth of experience, knowledge and new energy to the staff.",
      "\"Now is a good time to refresh the coaching team as we look to build on the achievements of the past two years and push to the next level.\"",

      "Rene Meulensteen suggested Gareth Southgate make a mammoth change in England's Euro 2024 final against Spain in order to unsettle Luis de la Fuente's side",
      "Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has sensationally proposed dropping Harry Kane for England's Euro 2024 final against Spain.",
      "The Three Lions skipper has netted three times during the tournament, making him the competition's joint-top scorer alongside five other players. That is despite the fact he's been taken off in every knockout game, with speculation surrounding his fitness or lack thereof continually heating up throughout the tournament.",
      "Kane entered the Euros having missed Bayern Munich last two games of the season following a back injury. Ollie Watkins' dramatic winner against the Netherlands has sparked a conversation over whether he should start ahead of the Tottenham man on Sunday.",
      "Meulensteen - who served for six years as a coach under Sir Alex Ferguson - has suggested Gareth Southgate must drop his captain to the bench for the good of the team on Sunday (July 14). During an appearance on talkSPORT on Thursday (July 11), the Dutchman laid out his formula to unsettle Spain, which is centred on dropping the country's all-time goalscorer in the final.",
      "\"If you want to unsettle Spain, you need legs, energy and intensity,\" he said. \"So if you could start with another striker, you keep Harry on the bench because if the game settles down going into the second half and still Kane can get a good 30 or 45 minutes, and maybe extra-time and penalties, you bring him in later in the game.\"",
      "Watkins would be the obvious option to replace Kane after his goal against the Netherlands. But Ivan Toney has also come off the bench during the tournament and could provide Southgate with another option, should he choose to change it.",
      "Meulensteen admitted he does not believe Southgate will make that call, but reiterated the danger Spain can cause if England do not press as a unit. \"I would make sure that they got players there in the midfield that can back them [Spain] up and squeeze Spain. If you don't, because one player doesn't and Harry hasn't got the legs, they play around you\".",
      "Kane addressed his fitness concerns prior to their semi-final win over the Netherlands on Wednesday. He rebuffed the speculation over whether he is 100% fit, and went as far to state that he feels he's only getting sharper as the tournament goes.",
      "\"Maybe sometimes when I don't score I think the fitness one is an easy one just to throw in now – 'Why? Is there a reason? Is it his fitness? Is it not?' But like I said before the tournament, I felt like I had a good preparation going into it, I felt like I'm getting better and sharper as the games go along,\" Kane said.",

      "The Welsh winger was all smiles when he rocked up to Carrington on international duty in 2019 - with a move from Real Madrid to Manchester United teased at the time",
      "Gareth Bale walked into Manchester United's training complex for international training with Wales sporting a cheeky grin back in 2019 - as the rumour mill churned that the Red Devils were looking to edge him away from Real Madrid.",
      "Ryan Giggs' side were borrowing United's Carrington complex to prepare for their games with Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Slovakia - the nation's facility in north Wales not quite ready at the time. And Bale's smile as he walked past a massive mural of Marcus Rashford added even more speculation as to whether the then 29-year-old was set for a move back to the UK.",
      "As a youngster, the pacey and powerful left winger burst through the ranks at Southampton - before signing his first professional contract with the club in 2006. He would only remain in the southern city for one year before Spurs came knocking, snapping him up for £5million with the potential to rise to £10million - perhaps one of the biggest steals in Premier League history.",
      "Bale would score 42 goals in 146 appearances at White Hart Lane for Spurs before a world-record money move to Real Madrid came to fruition in 2013 - the Galacticos paying £85.1million for his services. In his prime, the Welshman would win three league titles, five Champions League trophies, two UEFA Super Cups and a Copa del Ray - bagging 81 goals and 46 assists in 176 La Liga appearances.",
      "He would return to Spurs for one last dance on loan in the 2020/21 season, before capping off his career at Los Angeles FC in 2023. One of, if not the greatest Welsh footballer of all time, Bale was a massive 'what if?' for United fans worldwide - who watched him develop and conquer with hopes that one day he would arrive at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking in 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson admitted that United were first in line to sign Bale from Southampton - only to reportedly be let down by officials at St Mary's. While Fergie never held a grudge against Bale, he was frustrated that the winger went to Spurs instead of the Reds.",
      "He said at the time: \"We were disappointed in Southampton at the time because we were first there, but they never came back to us. We were disappointed in that. Gareth was a left-back when we tried to sign him. It wasn't until Harry (Redknapp) went to Tottenham that he converted him into a wide-left player.",
      "\"He reminds me a bit of when we signed Lee Sharpe. Lee was a six-foot, gangly slim boy, but all of a sudden he was built like a light heavyweight American boxer. Bale is the same, the way he has developed physically in the last two years. He has matured very well.\"",
      "While Ferguson would retire from Manchester United with 38 trophies to his name, the Red Devils didn't give up in their pursuit of bringing Bale to the North West. David Moyes said that he came close to making Bale his first official signing at United - but ultimately conceded that he would be unable to prevent a then-world record move to Madrid.",
      "He told eirSport in 2019: \"I wanted him to be my first signing at Manchester United. We came close, spoke to him, but he had his heart set on Real Madrid and we couldn't talk him out of it. It was a real disappointment because I saw him as a Manchester United-type player.",
      "\"He carries himself well, I think he's a terrific player. He can play wide, we can play as a striker now that he's developed that. I just think all round he's a terrific athlete and a brilliant footballer so I think that he would have fitted what we wanted but I couldn't talk him out of it.\"",
      "When asked if Manchester United held talks with Bale about a move to Old Trafford, Moyes responded: \"Yeah, we did. I think we even had a helicopter at the training ground waiting to go down and get him at one point. I think we had a bigger offer in and we had sorted things out but I think his heart was already on going to Real Madrid at the time.\"",
      "It is reported that United made at least four moves for Bale before calling quits - once from Southampton and Tottenham, the other two from Madrid - but the Galacticos were unable to relinquish his services. While it is thought that Bale wanted away from Spain towards the latter stages of his career, his £350,000 wages were untenable for most clubs.",

      "That's so that United can spread the payments over three years, with the Netherlands international set to sign a contract which runs until 2029. Zirkzee, who came through the ranks at Bayern Munich, will mark the Red Devils' first signing of the INEOS era.",

United have negotiated a sell-on clause for the ex-Ajax midfielder, who they spent £40m on to sign in 2020.",
      "Manchester United have pulled out of the race to sign Benfica wonderkid Joao Neves, instead turning their focus to Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte. Portuguese outlet O Jogo report that after PSG made a £76m offer for Neves, United have decided against matching the French club's bid.",
      "Should they be successful in their pursuit of Neves, then PSG would likely be willing to offload Ugarte. The Uruguayan, 23, only joined the Ligue 1 champions from Sporting Lisbon a year ago and has made 37 appearances under Luis Enrique but his future is uncertain.",

      "A move to Manchester United and Arsenal was on the cards for legendary Dutch midfielder Ronald de Boer, but neither materialised.",
      "De Boer and his twin brother Frank spent the majority of their illustrious careers together, with spells at their boyhood club Ajax, Barcelona, and Rangers.",
      "Impressing after the 1998 World Cup, where the Netherlands lost to Brazil in the semi-finals, De Boer had a host of clubs vying for his signature, including Arsene Wenger's Arsenal.",
      "Made to stay put at Ajax that summer, a January move to Barcelona followed for the Dutchman, the subject of interest from Sir Alex Ferguson just a year later in 2000.",
      "De Boer was initially close to landing in north London, but his club's refusal to sell him and his twin brother after the World Cup campaign they'd both just enjoyed left the move dead in the water.",
      "He told FourFourTwo: “Yeah, I did speak with Arsene Wenger about joining Arsenal. That was before the 1998 World Cup. He called me to ask if we could meet so that he could explain his ideas in person.",
      "“We met at the Okura Hotel in Amsterdam. He said I could be an important player for his Arsenal team and he demonstrated what my role could be. He was keen to sign me and I was happy to join: I felt like this kind of opportunity might not come again.",
      "“Everything would be finalised after the World Cup. I remember speaking to David Dein on the phone, discussing my salary and the duration of my contract. Everything was sorted; it was only down to Ajax and Arsenal to agree a transfer fee.",
      "“But me and Frank played very well at the World Cup and Ajax suddenly said they didn’t want any of us to leave – they wanted to retain the core of the team. We both felt misled, so decided that we wanted to leave Ajax immediately.”",
      "Another English side, this one also donning red, approached De Boer again after he'd made his switch to La Liga - but the Dutchman was advised against the move by future United boss Louis van Gaal.",
      "“I remember being in the Barcelona kit room, speaking to Alex Ferguson on the phone. He told me he was keen to sign me for United, and explained how he’d use me in midfield.",
      "“But around the same time, Dick Advocaat approached me on behalf of Rangers. I remember being in the Dutch camp, talking about my future with Van Gaal, who had since become the head coach of the national team.",
      "“I asked him what he thought. He said that at Rangers I’d always play, which would be better for me as a 30-year-old, and for my role in the Dutch team as well.",
      "“I chose Rangers, also because of my knee, which wasn’t perfect. I wasn’t injured, but I thought I might not get through the United medical. At Rangers, I was able to sign for four years, which gave me some certainty. If Van Gaal had advised me to join United, however, I would have done that. I really valued his opinion.”",
      "The midfielder spent four years at Rangers from 2000 until 2004 when he left to join Qatari club Al-Rayyan. He stayed in the country and acted as an Olympic advisor in 2010. De Boer never took the step into management as his brother, Frank, did with Inter, Crystal Palace and the Netherlands. The midfielder's career could've panned out very differently, however, were it not for Ajax's refusal and Van Gaal's advice.",

      "A 6ft 3in and used to being a lone striker like Hojlund, it's expected that only one of them will make it into Ten Hag's starting line-up once the new season gets going. Hojlund, though, is ready for the tussle, as he explained on Instagram.",
      "Posting a picture of himself on holiday eating a huge tomahawk steak, the former Atalanta hotshot wrote as the caption: \"This is how hungry I am for the season to start.\"",

The ex-Bayern Munich prospect - who had loan spells with Parma and Anderlecht before signing for Bologna in 2022 - made his debut for the Netherlands last weekend, coming on as a second-half substitute during their quarter-final victory over Turkey.",

      "Zirkzee is set to fly to the UK to undergo on a medical on Friday after the Netherlands were knocked out of Euro 2024. The 24-year-old came on as a substitute as his side were beaten 2-1 by England in their semi-final clash on Wednesday.",
      "United have agreed a deal with Bologna to pay €42.5m (£35.7m) instead of triggering Zirkzee's £34m release clause. That is because they would have had to have paid the release clause in full.",
      "However, United will now be able to pay the fee in instalments across a three-year period. Zirkzee is also set to sign a five-year contract, with United having an option to extend it for a further year.",
      "Following the Netherland's Euros exit, Zirkzee wrote on social media: \"A big let down last night. It was a dream come true to be part of this team (yet still) and I am proud and grateful to wear this shirt. Orange fans, thank you for your support.\"",
      "The Red Devils are also closing in on Matthijs De Ligt, while Lazio prepare to hijack Mason Greenwood's move to Marseille. United are ready to pay £43million to Bayern Munich for Dutch centre-half De Ligt, who featured under manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax, but who did not play at minute at Euro 2024.",
      "Lazio were the early favourites to land Greenwood before Marseille offered £27million for the striker, who has no future at Old Trafford. But Marseille mayor Benoit Payan is leading opposition to the move because Greenwood was arrested in 2022 over allegations of attempted rape, assault and coercive behaviour, although all charges were subsequently dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "\"I do not want my club to be covered in shame,\" Payan told RMC. \"It is not acceptable.\" A number of Marseille fans also protested against the club's move for Greenwood, with the #GreenwoodNotWelcome hashtag used on social media.",
      "New Marseille boss and former Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi has tried to defend Greenwood and United need to sell him to help pay for Zirkzee and De Ligt. \"Greenwood isn't recruited yet, so there isn't much to say,\" said De Zerbi when asked about the move.",
      "\"He's a champion, an international level player. I don't know what happened, I'm not concentrating on private lives. When a player signs for the club, I consider him my child. Even if I can pull his ear in private, I will defend him publicly. My players are like my sons.\"",

      "Former United striker Van Nistelrooy is joined by Rene Hake, ex-manager of Dutch top-flight side Go Ahead Eagles. The duo fill the roles left by departing coaches Mitchell van der Gaag and Benni McCarthy.",
      "Steve McClaren and Darren Fletcher will remain part of Ten Hag's coaching staff, as the Dutchman explained in a statement: \"I am delighted that Rene and Ruud have agreed to join our project, adding a wealth of experience, knowledge and new energy to the staff.",
      "\"Now is a good time to refresh the coaching team as we look to build on the achievements of the past two years and push to the next level.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy, who managed PSV Eindhoven in the 2022-23 season and was in talks to take the Burnley job before United's successful pursuit, spent five years at Old Trafford and scored 150 goals in just 219 games. The 48-year-old fan favourite is expected to work primarily with United's forwards as McCarthy did, while Hake will serve as Ten Hag's immediate right-hand man.",
      "Hake, 52, has followed a similar career path to United boss Ten Hag, as both men have managed Go Ahead Eagles and Utrecht. Last season, Hake led Go Ahead Eagles to ninth place in the Eredivisie, the club's best finish for more than 15 years.",
      "Ten Hag said of his outgoing colleagues: \"Mitchell has decided that now is the right time for him to pursue his own ambitions in a number one position; I want to pay tribute to his fantastic service over the past two years, and also to Benni for his important contributions. We send them our thanks and best wishes for the future.\"",
      "Your turn! Should Manchester United have kept Erik ten Hag in charge? Give us your verdict in the comments section",
      "United's newly-appointed sporting director, Dan Ashworth, added: \"Together with Erik, we are working to strengthen all areas of our men's first-team operations, and refreshing the coaching staff is an important part of that.",
      "\"It's a particular pleasure to welcome Ruud back to the club where he enjoyed so much success as a player, and I know that he and Rene will help reinforce the winning mentality and high standards we are aiming for.\"",

      "The Manchester United midfielder partnered Declan Rice and produced an impressive display against the Dutch side. Mainoo, 19, has enjoyed a remarkable rise since making his first league start for United in November, and reaching a Euros final is the latest milestone in his incredible journey.",
      "Mainoo, who scored in the FA Cup final, has consistently been unfazed by the pressure of the occasion. The teenager proved as much by finding time to congratulate one of his ex-team-mates on the same day that he lined up in a semi-final for the Three Lions.",

      "McNeill was released by United this summer after coming to the end of his contract. The 20-year-old was once snapped up from local rivals Manchester City - scoring 24 goals in 21 U18 games during his debut season - and made his sole first-team appearance aged 18, coming on against Real Sociedad in the Europa League.",

      "Greenwood has not featured for United since January 2022 when he was suspended by the club following his arrest for attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, Greenwood saw the case against him discontinued when the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew all charges, following the withdrawal of co-operation from key witnesses.",

      "The Canadian rapper has a soft spot for the Premier League giants and popped over to Old Trafford during the golden era of Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure. During that time, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney were propelling the Red Devils to numerous league triumphs and the coveted Champions League trophy in 2008.",
      "During a visit, Drake wanted to catch up with Ferdinand, but little did he know that he'd also get an unexpected introduction to Ferdinand's teammate, Owen Hargreaves. The encounter took an awkward turn as Hargreaves was completely taken aback by the sudden appearance of Drake and his crew.",
      "Revealing all on his FIVE podcast, with Hargreaves right beside him, Ferdinand recounted the cringeworthy moment: \"[I told Hargreaves] 'Come out, I need you to meet this guy, man'. He [Hargreaves] came out all wet dripping, hair all over. Drake is standing there [and] my guy [Hargreaves] is standing there with the fruit and veg out, as you do.\"",
      "Confirming the incident, Hargreaves added his side of the story, admitting he was only clad in a towel slung over his shoulder, which left Drake's posse quite shocked. The ex-midfielder said: \"So he's [Ferdinand] called me. He said, 'Oh, come out. I want you to meet somebody'. So I can't see, all I can do is hear him.",

      "Hargreaves made the move to United from Bundesliga heavyweights Bayern Munich in 2007, having previously played youth football at Canadian underdogs Calgary Foothills. He was born to British parents who had moved to Canada before his birth.",
      "However, the career of the 42-cap England international has been largely overshadowed by severe injury issues which ultimately ended his career at just 31.",
      "The midfielder clinched the Bundesliga four times, DFB-Pokal three times, and the Champions League with Bayern Munich before adding to his trophy haul at Old Trafford. Hargreaves played a crucial role in United's 2007/08 Premier League and Champions League double-winning squad, but injuries limited him to only five more appearances over the next three seasons.",
      "He departed United in 2011 and signed with Manchester City as a free agent, but only managed four appearances before retiring due to injuries.",

      "Premier League shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez has established himself as one of the world's best, but could have been playing under Erik ten Hag had the club not pulled the plug on a deal",
      "The agent of former Manchester United transfer target Emiliano Martinez reckons the goalkeeper can emulate compatriot Diego Maradona and bring trophies to Aston Villa.",
      "On the back of Bernd Leno's injury for Arsenal, Argentinian deputy Martinez stepped in and made a name for himself, winning the FA Cup in 2020. He then joined Aston Villa that summer and quickly became one of the Premier League's best shot-stoppers.",
      "When David de Gea left United in 2023, a new man between the sticks was needed. Martinez was at the top of that list, but United turned instead to Andre Onana, someone Erik Ten Hag was familiar with at Ajax.",
      "Now, the Argentinian's agent has spoken about his client's frustration at the deal's collapse and how Martinez can emulate Maradona in bringing success to the Villans, who are in this year's Champions League.",
      "While Onana's time at United has been dotted with pivotal errors, Martinez has come on leaps and bounds. A World Cup winner with Argentina and progressing well in this year's Copa America, there's no real debate over who is the best keeper.",
      "Martinez's agent, Gustavo Goni, recalled the prospective United deal, telling ESPN: \"Emiliano had the chance last year to go to Manchester United. We were very close.",
      "\"The manager at the time decided in favour of Andre Onana because he already knew him from Ajax. But everyone in Manchester said that the ideal goalkeeper to win was Emiliano Martinez. The sporting director, the scouts, and everyone we spoke to.\"",
      "Goni also believes that his client could go on to do great things with the Villans, stating, \"He has the chance to become for Aston Villa what Diego Maradona was for Napoli. Maradona was great at Napoli, and being there did not stop him from being the best in the world.",
      "\"I always tell Dibu that he has the chance to repeat at Aston Villa what Maradona did at Napoli. Today he is in one of the best projects, they have one of the best sporting directors in the world, they have one of the most prestigious coaches in the world, and they have qualified for the Champions League when nobody thought it was possible.",
      "\"They will surely compete in the Champions League, and with a goalkeeper like Emiliano, who can easily surprise you, perhaps they will end up competing on a big scale. Perhaps he can put Aston Villa at the level of the big European clubs.\"",
      "Though a move this summer isn't completely ruled out, Martinez looks likely to stay at Villa Park and could play a Maradona-like role in helping his club taste success in a European competition.",

The veteran wouldn't have envisaged the role he played as injuries ravaged through the backline but when he stepped in, he used his quality and helped United over the line - in particular his role in the FA Cup final win after replacing Lisandro Martinez. It is clear that defensive reinforcements are needed this summer but the extension for Evans is the perfect injection of experience needed to improve fortunes.",
      "Bayern Munich fans object De Ligt sale",
      "Manchester United have verbally agreed personal terms with Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt. The Dutchman is poised to reunite with former Ajax manager Erik ten Hag after spending his formative years under the United tactician.",
      "The 24-year-old is valued at £42million but United are optimistic of landing the Holland international as they target two central defenders.",
      "According to BILD's Christian Falk, there has been some pushback from Bavaria with over 68,000 fans signing a petition to keep the defender.",
      "He said: \"It’s true, there’s a petition to keep Matthijs de Ligt at Bayern, and many, many fans signed it already. At least 68,000 in fact. That shows you how important he is for Bayern and it’s a pity that Vincent Kompany doesn’t see it. I would sign the petition as well because I think the first step for a defender is to defend – and de Ligt is one of the best in Europe.",
      "\"As you already saw, he’s very close now to Manchester United. A few months ago, when it wasn’t clear who the next coach would be, he told me that he wanted to stay at Bayern, but Erik ten Hag did a good job.",
      "\"He’s also shown the player what he wants to do with him so I think this will happen very soon because the clubs have now began to talk. Bayern want €50m plus add-ons, bringing the fee to nearer €60m. We will see if United wants to pay it because de Ligt has made it very clear that he only wants to go to United. I heard PSG were also interested but I don’t think this will happen.\"",
      "MEN says: Adding De Ligt would be astute business from United. The Dutchman has fallen out of favour at Bayern and if there is one man to unlock the best version of the 24-year-old, it is Ten Hag. The pair know each other well which is a bonus and if there was an opportunity to prove doubters wrong, you will struggle to find many better places to do so than at Old Trafford and Manchester United.",

      "Signing Dutch strikers is not as advisable as it was in Ruud van Nistelrooy's heyday but Joshua Zirkzee should give Man United something they have lacked under Erik ten Hag.",
      "The jejune Manchester United social media team ignored a request to post news of Toby Collyer's new contract on Thursday. More housekeeping is required on the club website.",
      "Two players listed on the first team section are not United players Shola Shoretire is without a club and Sofyan Amrabat plays for Fiorentina.",
      "Donny van de Beek has been removed. United said \"Thank you, Donny\". For what? His two goals came in defeats. Maybe it was that time he forced a corner at Brighton that led to a penalty.",
      "United now have a sensibly sized squad of 27 senior players (including Jadon Sancho). Hannibal Mejbri was not assigned a squad number on his return for pre-season but sported his usual 46 on the second day back at Carrington.",
      "Twenty-six is a healthy minimum number for a campaign that will include eight matches in the new Europa League format. Erik ten Hag will be factoring in breakthroughs from the academy, too.",
      "\"In every season, after a break, you will have surprises,\" Ten Hag stressed on Monday. \"We’re looking forward, we’re so curious. Who is it this season, the surprise who can contribute to our team?",
      "\"Like last year, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho coming up and playing a big role. They are the two goalscorers in the final. Today, we started, but which player is there who can do the same?\"",
      "Ten Hag was particularly warm with Harry Amass in the Carrington canteen after United's under 18s won the Premier League North last season and there is a vacancy at left back. Luke Shaw is preparing to start a second European Championship final and Tyrell Malacia is still missing in action.",
      "Amass arrived from the Watford academy last year and only turned 17 in March. His work experience of travelling with the team, sitting on the bench and warming up in front of packed stands was invaluable and stands him in good stead.",
      "Ethan Wheatley had the privilege of becoming the 250th academy graduate, though his pathway is crammed. The same could have been said of Garnacho two years ago and he is one of United's few indispensables.",
      "The transfer window is open for just under seven more weeks and United ought to be aiming for seven players in and seven out. There have been four coaching departures this calendar year and three have arrived to refresh the backroom staff.",
      "After Bologna qualified for the Champions League in May, Joshua Zirkzee hoisted a two-stick banner bearing his face and the message Lo squadrone che tremare il mondo fa - the squad that makes the world tremble. United will hope he is the striker who makes defenders tremble.",
      "Zirkzee will offer dynamism and determination, two words Anthony Martial was seldom synonymous with after he was gifted a five-and-a-half year contract in January 2019. There is unlikely to be any booing if or when Rasmus Hojlund is substituted next season as there was in the home defeats to Brighton and Manchester City.",
      "\"He's not a prolific striker but the kind of player who can excite fans,\" a source who has dealt with Bologna said of Zirkzee. Those who watched the Dutchman in Italy say he is an alternative United have needed up front for two years. A well-travelled scout added Zirkzee offers a \"top link, good footballer. Drops back to play.\"",
      "An established and proven goalscorer would have been preferable but United have a frontman to keep Hojlund on his toes. Hojlund has been better as a substitute than a starter since he returned from injury in March and his goalless performances at the European Championship were similar to his domestic droughts with United.",
      "Wout Weghorst emerged ahead of Zirkzee for the Netherlands though Ronald Koeman's management was rife with misjudgements. Stefan de Vrij was preferred over Micky van de Ven and De Vrij fatefully stood off Ollie Watkins as the clock hit 90 minutes in Dortmund. Xavi Simons was illogically dropped for the group stage defeat to Austria and Jeremie Frimpong was underused across their six matches.",
      "This is the fourth summer running United have welcomed a Champions League winner. Zirkzee was an unused substitute for Bayern Munich in their hollow victory over Paris Saint-Germain in Lisbon in 2020 as the Covid-19 curve began to rise again.",
      "United may argue winning, and qualifying for, the Champions League are more relevant than Zirkzee's nationality amid Ten Hag's predilection for Dutch-schooled recruits. The Netherlands have not had a world-class goalscorer since Robin van Persie's international career peaked at the 2014 World Cup.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy, back at United as a coach, had Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Roy Makaay and Pierre van Hooijdonk to vie with in his heyday. Since the Dutch overachieved in Brazil ten years ago, the future has neither been bright nor orange with Weghorst, Vincent Janssen, Luuk de Jong, Brian Brobbey et al.",
      "Zirkzee's modest goalscoring record (36 goals in 126 senior club games) is offset by a £36.5m fee (almost half of what Hojlund cost) spread across three years. That eases some of the pressure. As does his supposed substitute status.",
      "Bayern are more harshly pilloried in their homeland than United, so Zirkzee should have an idea of the scrutiny that awaits when he dons a different shade of red.",
      "Those signing images will appear on the United social feeds.",

      "England's transition from a back four to a back three at the European Championship has been serene, seamless and also a tad fortuitous.",
      "If Switzerland had not adopted the set-up, it is unlikely Gareth Southgate would have matched them in the quarter-finals. The victory over the Netherlands was Southgate's best night in the dugout as England's opponents were forced to adapt.",
      "Ronald Koeman, the Netherlands coach, had some success once he replaced the cumbersome Memphis Depay and Donyell Malen at the pause. The Dutch edged a cagier second half until Stefan de Vrij stood off Ollie Watkins in what was a rare tactical triumph for Southgate.",
      "Immortality on Sunday would see his odds to become the next Manchester United manager shorten. Two allies occupy two of the most senior roles at Old Trafford and emulating Sir Alf Ramsey has been beyond 12 England managers spanning 58 years.",
      "Whatever the outcome in Berlin, United should not touch Southgate with a bargepole. They should, however, consider the flexibility a defensive trident offers, particularly if Luke Shaw lines up for the national anthem with Kobbie Mainoo against Spain.",
      "Mainoo's belated promotion to a competitive starter has underpinned England's gradual progress. The Dutch have seldom showcased Total Football since Euro 2008 and Mainoo was more Oranje than those in orange.",
      "Louis van Gaal has much to answer for. The Netherlands overachieved by finishing third at the 2014 World Cup with a rigid back three that was spearheaded by the devastating Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. Van Gaal, once synonymous with style, favoured substance.",
      "Drunk from the success, Van Gaal attempted to transmit it to a United side in transition at the start of the 2014-15 campaign. Tyler Blackett, so hopeless on loan at Birmingham he was booed by their supporters, was welcomed back into the fold as United's only left-footed centre back. Jesse Lingard started at wing back on his debut. United lost 2-1 to Swansea and Van Gaal eventually abandoned the back three after three league games.",
      "It was resurrected in nine matches out of 11 in December and January. United won six, drew two and lost one but their clinical finishing could not mask some unsettling performances. After United inexplicably won at Southampton, Gary Neville dubbed them the \"Dog and Duck\". Ie. a pub team. In the reverse fixture at Old Trafford a month later, they lost without mustering an attempt on target.",
      "The back three sequence ended in-game at Queens Park Rangers, where United fans chanted \"Four-four-two!\" They won 2-0.",
      "Eight years on and at another World Cup, Van Gaal's third stint as the Netherlands coach ended with a back three. Frenkie de Jong was the team's linchpin and it is just as well his wage deferrals were never addressed by Barcelona.",
      "As elegant as De Jong is (and he was sorely missed by the Netherlands against England), he never sounded particularly thrilled at the prospect of reuniting with Erik ten Hag in Manchester.",
      "In his absence, Ten Hag has hot-housed the Manchester born and United-bred Mainoo into a midfielder who could be mistaken for a Barcelona prodigy or a Pep Guardiola product. Mainoo has outperformed his fellow England midfielders who fetched nine-figure fees last summer.",
      "Mainoo is already a talent to build the team around for club and country. Southgate, who did not originally name Mainoo in his squad for the March internationals and picked Trent Alexander-Arnold and Connor Gallagher ahead of him in the group stage, has cottoned on.",
      "United are prioritising centre backs when their most significant addition will be the midfielder to take a back seat behind Mainoo. Mason Mount, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen nor Scott McTominay are the answer.",
      "A defensive trio of Matthijs de Ligt, Jarrad Branthwaite and Lisandro Martinez would give United a solid and skilful foundation to shape-shift. Martinez has experience of playing in midfield - though is untried there for United - while Branthwaite and De Ligt are footballing defenders who ought to be at ease striding into the middle third.",
      "Mainoo is a midfielder for now but he has the fleet of foot and foraging instincts of a budding playmaker. His telepathy with Phil Foden in Dortmund enabled the Manchester City playmaker to finally influence England's attack.",
      "Shaw and Diogo Dalot are purposeful full backs capable of assuming the responsibility of wing backs. Dalot added a string to his bow last season with those diagonal charges to the final third, yielding a winning goal at Brighton in May.",
      "United can get a tune out of Bruno Fernandes wherever he plays. Alejandro Garnacho, a winger, jars with a back three formation but he has the engine to double as a wing back. Bukayo Saka has caught fire for England since he was repositioned there and that purportedly deeper role fuelled his average higher positions against the Swiss and the Dutch.",
      "Amad, with his incision and stints as a false nine, would be a legitimate option. Mount's greatest night in football was as one of the two behind Timo Werner in Chelsea's Champions League final triumph three years ago.",
      "Mount is another United ally of Southgate's.",

      "Manchester United fan and Stockport lad Nathan Aspinall is relishing the prospect of defending his World Matchplay title, despite going into the tournament with an injury.",
      "Aspinall enjoyed the biggest win of his career when claiming the Matchplay title in Blackpool last July and delivered the most dominant display in a final at Winter Gardens since 2009.",
      "After that landmark breakthrough, Aspinall paraded the Matchplay trophy at Edgeley Park, home of Stockport County. The world number four in darts is a local hero in Stockport and he's already received dozens of messages of support ahead of his Matchplay defence this weekend.",
      "Aspinall visited the Manchester Evening News' office in March for a podcast to discuss United and his homecoming to the AO Arena for the Premier League of darts, and he spoke exclusively to the MEN again earlier this week about his thoughts before the Matchplay tournament.",
      "The World Matchplay is one of darts' most prestigious tournaments and Aspinall is hopeful of going all the way again, despite currently nursing an arm injury that is causing him problems.",
      "\"To win a major like the Matchplay was a dream come true,\" Aspinall said about last year's success. \"My family were there, my friends were there, it's my local tournament and the support I got was unreal and my performance in that game were the best darts I've played.",
      "\"I've watched that game back a lot, and I think when you practice day in and day out, you always have a spell of 20 minutes or half an hour when you know you can't miss and you're praying and hoping that comes in a final. Once the score got to 5-5, I flicked the switch.",
      "\"I don't think Phil Taylor in his prime would have beat me. To have those legs in the final, it made it a lot easier, but I know this year's tournament will be tougher.\"",
      "Aspinall heads into the Matchplay as the defending champion but feels he could be impacted by his arm injury. \"The biggest threat to me at the moment is my arm, I've got an injury that everyone knows about now, and it's how my arm holds up,\" he explained.",
      "\"I was practising this afternoon with Michael Smith and I did two and a half hours and I played really well, but after that time, my arm went and told me I needed to go home. I think if my arm holds up, I'm confident in my own game and I can go deep, but it depends on how it goes.\"",
      "The bookmakers have priced up Aspinall's chances of winning back-to-back Matchplays at 20/1. He was asked whether that is disrespectful and said: \"It's been the story of my career, I go under the radar and as a player, I'm not really bothered about it.",
      "\"Let people put the pressure on the likes of Luke Littler, Luke Humphries and Michael van Gerwen. I'm not bothered, I'll go do my own thing, and the bookies always seem to put me as the underdog, but I must have cost them a fortune over the years and they will learn one day.",
      "\"I know my game is there, I can win it, it's going to be tough, but if you look at the draw, I've got quite a favourable draw and I play a debutant, Luke Woodhouse, in my opening game. I say let the bookies lose more money on me and I'll prove them all wrong once again.\"",
      "Winter Gardens in Blackpool is an iconic venue and Aspinall has previously said it produces the best atmosphere of all darting arenas. \"Everyone loves my walk-out song Mr Brightside and because the arena is quite old, the noise that it produces is just unbelievable,\" he said.",
      "\"It's quite compact and it's an amazing noise. What Phil Taylor did there for 16 years makes it a special tournament and now his name is on the trophy, which I want to win back.",
      "\"I'm so thankful for the support and the amount of messages I get on my phone each day wishing me good luck, even for tournaments that some people don't even know exist, is amazing.",
      "\"My mate is at a wedding on Saturday and he's given his tickets on the front row to a lad I haven't seen since Year 11 in school. He's coming to watch me and I'll meet him outside.",
      "\"I've not seen him for 17 years but he'll be there supporting me. The following I've got is incredible, my friends and family follow me everywhere, and it means the world to me, especially when I'm going through a difficult time, like now with my arm injury.",
      "\"That one guy from school on the front row on Saturday night, If I'm struggling with my arm, he might just be that extra five per cent that will get me over the line.\"",
      "Aspinall is a former season ticket holder at Old Trafford and secured tickets for the FA Cup final last season, which saw United defeat Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "\"I went to the game,\" he said with a smile. \"I was due to play in Holland and we miss so much as darts players, so I thought do you know what, I'm pulling out and watching the final. I went down on the train and I actually had a bet on them at 9/2 to lift the trophy.",
      "\"The first half was surreal and in the back of my mind, I was thinking City can still come back here, but fair to play to them and I think that's what kept Erik ten Hag in his job.",
      "\"I think it was the right decision as well, to be honest with you, I don't think there was anyone else out there. I just saw they've finally got rid of Donny van de Beek as well and that really didn't work out.",
      "\"Van de Beek is a massive darts fan and Michael Smith, who speaks to him a lot, was telling me about his transfer today, but I'm confident with the club at the moment.",
      "\"I'm sure they'll make a few good signings this summer, there's no uncertainty around Ten Hag anymore and hopefully it's the best season we have in years. United need to get back in the Champions League first and foremost, and lifting another trophy would be great.\"",
      "Although Aspinall is a United fan, he has a connection with Stockport County and reflected on the opportunity to parade the Matchplay trophy at Edgeley Park last year.",
      "\"I'm quite close to the president of Stockport and although I'm a United fan, I've got links with Stockport and they invited me to parade the trophy,\" Aspinall said. \"I said I'd never do it until I won the World Championship but the Matchplay is the next best thing so I thought why not?",
      "\"We had a great day, they looked after me, and I was there on the final day when they were promoted. I went to the after-party with the players, which was great. I was buzzing for the players, they're really good lads, and I'd love to see them come up again this season.\"",

      "“When people come from other leagues into the Premier League, they take time to settle. It is interesting to see how Zirkzee is going to do there because I maybe expected Man United to go for [a striker who is] a little more experienced.”",
      "MEN Sport's Isaac Seelochan says: Meulensteen raises an interesting point as United will now have two inexperienced strikers in Hojlund and Zirkzee when the Dutchman's signing is made official.",
      "However, there are very few experienced strikers available at the highest level and for fees which won't see the club blow most of their summer budget when other positions are of greater concern.",

      "Manchester United are closing in on their first summer signing as Joshua Zirkzee looks set to be the first addition since Sir Jim Ratcliffe arrived",
      "Manchester United's first summer transfer has seemingly been confirmed as Joshua Zirkzee closes in on a move to the Premier League.",
      "MEN Sport previously reported that talks between Zirkzee, Bologna and the Reds were progressing and United are confident they will be able to complete a deal before the month ends. The 23-year-old has a £33m release clause inserted into his contract at the Serie A club. On Friday, the former Bayern Munich forward arrived in the North West to undergo medical checks ahead of his €42.5million move.",
      "United agreed a deal, worth £35m, despite the Holland international's £34m release clause as the payments will be staggered over a three-year period as opposed to paying the fee upfront with the hope of completing the move as early as today (Friday).",
      "On Instagram, Zirkzee's agency - headed by superagent Kia Joorabchian - Sports Invest Official teased a move. Posting a picture to their story, the wordless picture features the United badge with eyes and finger pointing up emoji.",
      "The move for Zirkzee accelerated in light of Holland's agonising Euro 2024 semi-final defeat at the hands of Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw's England. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins scored in stoppage time to send Gareth Southgate's side through to Sunday's final in Berlin, where they will meet Spain.",
      "The Bologna forward made two appearances in Germany, both of which coming as late substitutes in the quarter final win over Turkiye and in the dying embers in Dortmund on Wednesday.",
      "Zirkzee will not be available to figure in United's first four pre-season matches and it is unclear if he will link up with the squad for the South Carolina leg of their pre-season tour of the United States. His first showing in the Premier League could come at Old Trafford as United kick off the Premier League season at Old Trafford against Fulham on Friday, August 16.",

      "Latest Manchester United transfer news as defender Willy Kambwala closes in on a surprise permanent exit",
      "Manchester United centre-back Willy Kambwala is 'close' to leaving the club and joining Villarreal, according to journalist Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The 19-year-old has made 10 appearances for United's first team and was often used by Erik ten Hag amid the injury crisis that hindered them last season. He appeared twice in the FA Cup and another eight in the Premier League.",
      "Kambwala's performances led to glowing praise by Ten Hag and the youngster had been tipped for a big future at Old Trafford. \"[Kambwala] has been training a while with us and progressing well,\" he told BBC Sport in April following the 2-2 draw with Liverpool. \"The next generation needs to step in and he is doing brilliantly. The challenge for him is doing it consistently.",
      "\"Great opportunity for him. We have other options, like bringing Casemiro in at centre-half, but today he deserved it and he showed it on the pitch.\"",
      "His displays for the first-team even led to former defender Raphael Varane claiming he could be the next academy wonderkid and follow in the footsteps of Kobbie Mainoo. \"He is showing his qualities. I think he will play more matches in the future and continue to improve,\" Varane said.",
      "\"He is very young, but he is showing qualities and we trust him. He has a great future.\"",
      "However, it now seems to be the case that Kambwala won't replicate Mainoo's pathway as a first-team regular at Old Trafford. Romano has reported that Villarreal are closing in on a deal to sign the teenager for a fee of around €10m (£8.4m).",
      "Posting on X, formerly Twitter, Romano wrote: \"Villarreal are closing in on deal to sign Willy Kambwala from Manchester United! Understand it will be a permanent transfer for fee around €10m for 2004 born CB.",
      "\"The deal also includes a future buy-back clause for Man United. Final details then... here we go, soon.\" Romano's claim that he will give the 'here we go, soon' hints that the move could well be imminent.",
      "United are said to have included a future buy-back clause in the deal. However, Kambwala is set to leave the club amid the imminent permanent arrival of Matthijs de Ligt. United are also tracking Lille centre-back Leny Yoro and Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite.",

The duo were at their sparkling best in the first half, with Foden a lick of paint away from scoring a Goal of the Tournament contender.",
      "Mainoo, who started for the third game running, was a colossus in the engine room, playing progressive passes, receiving the ball on the half turn and winning almost every second ball. His performance oozed class and he is almost guaranteed to start Sunday's final against Spain.",
      "Lauding his display in his post-match press conference, Southgate told reporters: \"I think all of his performances have been exceptional, especially when you consider his age. We haven't really had a player like him until now.",

He earned his full debut against Belgium three days later and has now won eight caps for his country, five of which have been earned at this tournament.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has put up £50m to redevelop Man Utd's Carrington training ground and Erik ten Hag is pleased with the work going on.",
      "Manchester United's return to Carrington for pre-season training this week was a little different than previous years, with players getting used to new surroundings.",
      "The builders are in at United's famous training ground and £50m of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's £234m cash injection into the club is being used to bring the facility up to scratch. It does mean disruption during this season, however.",
      "Erik ten Hag and his squad have moved out of their first-team building, with the work at Carrington set to take place for most of this season. They have taken over the women's building instead and will have spent this week getting used to their new workplace.",
      "In Ten Hag's interview with club media on his first day back he discussed the work going on and how it has resulted in a more \"compact\" training ground, but it sounds like a price worth paying and it was telling to hear how positive the United manager was about the plans for Carrington.",
      "\"We really have something to look forward to, being constructed over there, and that will be the best training ground in English football, but the most important is now,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"We live today and they did a great job to make this work and make this facility work to a professional condition, so we can work professionally. Four weeks ago here it was chaotic, now it's set up so professionally. We have a compact training ground, we have everything nearby, in good conditions, in good standards.",
      "\"There is no way not to be positive about this. It’s really exciting. You can feel the vibe already in this new facility, this new building. It’s our house and now we have to work in this. We’re looking forward and, as I say, it’s exciting. It’s all new and that gives a new dynamic as well.\"",
      "These are perhaps the most revealing comments in Ten Hag's interview, given so much of it was platitudes about his contract and then pre-season. The excitement around the redevelopment of the training ground was palpable and the disruption is just something the squad will have to live with for a year.",
      "In a way, that could have offered an excuse this season, but Ten Hag shot that down straight away. It's telling that Carrington was \"chaotic\" four weeks ago but the Dutchman is clearly pleased with the accommodations made for his squad, even if the decision to boot the women's team out of the training ground has been a bit of a PR disaster.",
      "Also telling was Ten Hag's statement that the redeveloped Carrington will be the \"best training ground in English football\", something that hasn't been the case for a while now. Cristiano Ronaldo's comments about the facility were particularly brutal when he left the club.",
      "\"Nothing changed, surprisingly,\" Ronaldo said about Carrington. \"Not only the pool, the jacuzzi, even the gym. Even the kitchen, the chefs, whom I appreciate – lovely people. They stopped in time. It surprised me a lot.",
      "\"I thought I would see other things, technologies and infrastructure. Unfortunately, we see a lot of what I used to see at 21, 22 and 23 years old. It really surprised me. Since Ferguson left, I haven't seen an evolution at the club. Progress is zero. You have to tear it down and rebuild it.\"",
      "That isn't quite what Ineos are doing but they are being proactive. When the Glazers were running United they let it drift, with minimal effort to improve facilities either at Carrington or Old Trafford. Ratcliffe is now trying to fix that.",
      "Clubs that opened new training grounds in the last five years have leapfrogged ahead of United. Liverpool's new Kirkby facility is much better. Even Leicester City's £100m Seagrave training ground is better than what United can offer.",
      "That is now changing and Ten Hag has revealed the extent of Ineos' ambition. The manager and his squad will get to see the development at close quarters this season and you can already sense the excitement around it.",

      "\"With Kobbie Mainoo the pick of the United youngsters by some distance, but all of them comfortable in possession, there was plenty to admire about a first half that finished goalless.\"",

      "Ten Hag is not a frequent attendant at academy matches but Altrincham's ground is a short journey for the cycling enthusiast and Hale resident. Without that bike ride, the wheels might have come off England's European Championship campaign.",
      "Mainoo played 90 minutes in a goalless draw with West Ham. Exactly a month later, he was named on the United bench for the first time in the goalless draw with Newcastle.",
      "Ten Hag felt Mainoo was already in his comfort zone at under-21 level and that he should have been more dominant against West Ham. Mainoo had already been summoned from the academy building for his first ad hoc promotion to first team training. He got to rub shoulders with Cristiano Ronaldo, Casemiro and new signing Antony the day after United beat Leicester in Ten Hag's fourth match in charge.",
      "Iqbal's impact and Ten Hag's constructive criticism pushed Mainoo in the right direction. His father had also advised United staff to provide some tough love. Come the halfway point of Ten Hag's first season, Mainoo had usurped Iqbal, bound for Utrecht.",
      "There has not been one outright breakthrough in Mainoo's nascent career. He showed teeth in the Goodison Park bear pit in his full Premier League debut in November but Ten Hag had planned to start last season with Mainoo in midfield until he was lucklessly injured after 74 seconds against Real Madrid in a pre-season friendly.",
      "Mainoo was so accomplished in midfield against the Arsenal duo of Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard at the start of that tour that he was accommodated with Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and new signing Mason Mount five days later in the defeat to Madrid.",
      "Long before Everton, Mainoo was the story to write home about from the winter training camp in Cadiz in December 2022. He made his debut a month later and was permanently promoted to the first team squad but a quad injury ended his first season in early April.",
      "United staff at the Montecastillo Hotel spoke optimistically about Mainoo during a training session journalists were invited to observe. \"That's when he (Ten Hag) first saw me properly,\" Mainoo told me in May.",
      "\"That's the first time I played under him in a game and, definitely to score in that (the friendly against Cadiz) was definitely me turning a corner, him seeing me. And then I trained with them a lot more and got to show myself a lot more.\"",
      "Two breakthroughs preceded breakdowns. Everton was third time lucky. Mainoo has not suffered an injury since the Real Madrid winger Rodrygo accidentally collided with his ankle last July.",
      "The Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa delivered an erudite lecture last week on how the commercialisation of football was diluting it as a spectacle. The European Championship has been sterile and its change in format from 16 teams to 24 teams has sapped its quality.",
      "Then you watch Lamine Yamal outclass France with such grace it makes you wonder if the divine Lionel Messi bathed him in holy water for that baby calendar shoot in 2007. Then you watch Mainoo dance past Dutch midfielders like a disciple of Cruyff.",

      "The Manchester United co-owner was in the midst of criticising how wasteful the club has been when it has come to splashing the cash in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. The Reds have spent north of £1billion since the legendary Scot's retirement and the number of success stories do not take long to count.",
      "One of United's biggest failings of the past 11 years has been the way in which they have splashed the cash recklessly, rarely getting their money's worth. They have wasted an enormous amount on players who have not come anywhere close to justifying such lucrative price tags.",
      "Few players fit that bracket more than Jadon Sancho and Antony. United spent a collective £158.4million to bring the two wingers to Old Trafford in back-to-back summer transfer windows.",
      "Sancho was one of the most coveted stars in football when United swooped for him in July 2021, signing him from Borussia Dortmund, and almost everyone was confident he would replicate the form he had produced in Germany in England. Three years since he made the move to Old Trafford, he has scored just 12 goals in 82 appearances and has already spent six months back in Germany.",
      "Just over a year later, following the appointment of Erik ten Hag, United attempted to correct their right-wing troubles for a second time in as many summer windows, swooping for Antony. He was hand-picked by Ten Hag and it was hoped he would succeed where Sancho had failed.",
      "Between them, Sancho and Antony have scored 23 goals in 164 matches in United colours. It is an indefensible return.",
      "But while Sancho's United career is as good as over, following his public fallout with Ten Hag almost a year ago, Antony is still in with a chance of turning his Old Trafford fortunes around. Many United fans will argue he should be a player Ineos attempt to offload this summer, but that is a far easier said than done task because of a handful of factors.",
      "Highly likely to still be a United player come the end of the transfer window, Antony faces the challenge of competing with three colleagues for a starting berth on the right-wing. United's other right-wing options currently include Alejandro Garnacho, Facundo Pellistri and Amad. Sancho's only hope of being welcomed back into that group would have relied on Ten Hag being axed.",
      "With Sancho destined to leave, either on loan or permanently, Garnacho, Pellistri, Antony and Amad are the ones vying for the title of right-wing-in-chief. Garnacho was the subject of a tactical switch by Ten Hag midway through last season, swapping the left for the right, and he ended the season by starting and scoring in the FA Cup final from that flank.",
      "He was United's best winger by some distance last season, scoring 10 goals and registering five assists. On that evidence, the right wing berth is his to lose.",
      "However, Antony, Amad and Pellistri will all be of the opinion they are each good enough to start week-in, week-out, either at Old Trafford or elsewhere. Of that trio, Pellistri is the most likely to depart this summer, with Real Valladolid already expressing interest in signing the Uruguayan.",
      "Since joining United in 2020, he has played just 24 times and has been sent out on loan twice. There is a general feeling that it would be in everybody's best interests for him to secure a permanent exit.",
      "Should that possibility come to fruition, United, providing Sancho is also moved on, would be down to three players who are options for the right. That is a healthy and manageable figure, especially when Garnacho is equally capable of playing on the left as well.",
      "Currently, United's attacking department is overrun with right-sided options, and a tally of four players is unbalanced and unhealthy. Three options, however, is a lot more manageable.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Adult sizes from £80",
      "Amad finally forced his way into Ten Hag's thinking at the end of last season and will be targeting an increase in minutes, reducing Pellistri's hopes of making the grade in the process. Along with Sancho, he needs moving on this summer.",
      "If United can get those two off the books, ideally on permanent deals, their attack will have a more balanced look to it and they will have raised some much-needed funds. It would be a win-win for everyone.",

      "Manchester United had a bid in the region of £50m accepted for Lille teenager Leny Yoro on Tuesday as they look to strengthen their defence",
      "Lille defender Leny Yoro has called out a fake X (formerly Twitter) account which claimed he was not interested in joining Manchester United.",
      "United have accelerated their interest in the French centre-back on Tuesday afternoon as they had a bid accepted by Yoro's Ligue 1 club for his services, MEN Sport understands. Reports in Spain have suggested the defender's preference is to sign for La Liga giants Real Madrid.",
      "Los Blancos are thought to be keen on the defender but are only willing to split the transfer fee over up front payments and add-ons. This is believed to be unacceptable in the eyes of Lille who are understood to be pushing Yoro towards United.",
      "The power is ultimately in Yoro's hands though and it remains to be seen if he will come to an agreement with United or not. Unsurprisingly, the developments on Tuesday have sparked interest on social media and sadly also imposter accounts.",
      "One such account impersonating Yoro tweeted: \"I don't want you Manchester United. Leave me alone.\"",
      "Yoro has since called out the account on social media, responding: \"Fake account. You guys are psycho. Signal [report] this account.\"",
      "This is obviously the first time Yoro has referenced a move to Old Trafford and it is difficult to gauge from his response whether or not he has an interest in the Reds. The 18-year-old is one of three centre-backs United are wanting to add to their squad this summer.",

      "Man United now have to get into the habit of not letting the manager solely decide players' futures. That forward planning has already started.",
      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "Man Utd need to make at least a couple of key signings during the summer transfer window but getting away from the 'United tax' is never easy.",
      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",

      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",

However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United will likely be sailing close to the wind when it comes to PSR compliance for 2023/24",
      "This week saw Manchester United post their quarterly financial results.",
      "As a publicly traded company, United are required to update shareholders and the New York Stock Exchange as to the financial condition of the club every three months, with the most recent set of results showing a pre-tax loss of £89.2m for the third quarter of the financial year, ending March 31.",
      "The club still has another three months to take into account for the 2023/24 financial year, up to the end June, and after such heavy losses in the early part of the year, attributed by the club largely to costs associated with the share purchase by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos, as well as nine fewer home games during the same time last year.",
      "The published financials have placed scrutiny on the club’s profit and sustainability rule (PSR) position, with the club sailing close to the wind as to what is permissible.",
      "The PSR acronym has become part of the football vernacular over the past 18 months, with Everton, twice, and Nottingham Forest being handed points deductions for PSR breaches during the course of the 2023/24 season.",
      "PSR, the Premier League’s financial controls that were introduced in 2012, allow for clubs to lose as much as £105m over a three-year period, with allowable deductions for losses related to investment in infrastructure, the academy, the women’s team, community initiatives, as well as the impact of Covid-19 on finances.",
      "Several clubs had to make moves to remain PSR compliant last month, with the June 30 date being the year-end for all but three Premier League clubs, and player trading occurring to maximise profit in order for clubs to get themselves under the £105m threshold.",
      "Manchester United weren’t one of those clubs scrambling to sell players before the June 30 deadline, something which points to confidence from the Old Trafford hierarchy that they will be compliant with PSR. But with United’s quarterly results published on Wednesday, it appears as if they may have just managed to ensure compliance, and that requires one significant cost to be an allowed deduction.",
      "The 27.7 per cent stake in the club acquired by Ratcliffe back in January carried with it a £34.4m cost related to the strategic review and share sale agreement, paid to the Raine Group merchant bank. It also included a sum of £5.5m in compensation for loss of office as part of the review and departing staff member. If the total £39.9m was an allowable deduction, which United chiefs will certainly argue as an exceptional cost, then the club are likely just about over the line in terms of PSR compliance looking at the estimates for the financial year end.",
      "However, the £5.5m may be hard to get passed as an allowable deduction as loss of office isn’t usually permissible, as is the case when managers and backroom staff depart.",
      "The lack of willingness to spend in January should be instructive as to United’s financial position for 2023/24, with the club not seeking to add any further financial burden.",
      "The club are now into a new financial year, with the prospect of an expected rise in revenues, although a lack of Champions League football will be impactful given the lesser revenues available in the Europa League.",
      "The club, given that there was no real urgency to move players on before June 30, will likely be confident that they can just about get over the PSR line, and they will have the full picture soon enough given the financial year ended a fortnight ago.",
      "But in order for additions to arrive this summer, it is highly likely that high-profit players will be on the market, such as academy graduates Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood, while players such as Jadon Sancho will carry some profit but will ease the payroll burden.",
      "Concerns over a points deduction seem unlikely, but in order to achieve the kind of growth competitively that Ratcliffe wants to see, at a time when he wants to address the significant cost burden that exists on the club’s balance sheet, Erik ten Hag and the club’s new senior management team of Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox will have to work smarter.",

      "Erik ten Hag’s side finished a record-low eighth last season but the FA Cup victory over Manchester City saved him from an exit amid speculation over his future at Old Trafford and the Dutchman has since had his contract extended by a year. United are set to announce the signing of Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee in the coming days for a reported fee of £36m as Ineos look to hand Ten Hag a squad capable of battling for major titles.",
      "Zirkzee has been touted as a promising prospect for some time now but only truly flourished at Bologna this season - under former Italian international Thiago Motta - contributing with 19 goal involvements in 37 domestic appearances.",
      "The Dutchman is a traditional centre-forward whose main attributes include pace and an aerial threat as he stands at 6ft 4in. He will provide competition for last year’s marquee signing Rasmus Højlund who impressed in patches during his first season in English football. In terms of numbers, last term Zirkzee edged the Dane slightly - Højlund registered 12 goal involvements in 30 appearances.",
      "Jadon Sancho has returned to Manchester United pre-season training after resolving the long-running feud with Ten Hag which resulted in a loan spell at Borussia Dortmund, where the Englishman impressed during the German’s run to the UEFA Champions League final. The 24-year-old looked confident in his ability and back to near his best in the second half of last season - he has not featured for United since August 26, 2023.",

The 24-year-old forward trained with the group on Thursday.\" United fly to Norway next week - MEN Sport understands Sancho will not take part - however he has been seen in first-team training as players filter back after the summer break.",
      "Sancho plays predominantly from the left flank - where Alejandro Garnacho has emerged Ten Hag's first-choice option ahead of Marcus Rashford following a difficult season for the Englishman - but also on the right wing where Amad and Antony predominantly play. Despite a crucial extra-time winner in the FA Cup against Liverpool, Amad’s form was patchy and Antony - who scored in the same fixture - struggled to find form. There is a possibility the misfortune of Antony and Amad will play into Sancho’s hands, if he can get a positive pre-season reintegrating into the first-team squad there is a real chance he could be a big part of Ten Hag’s starting XI next term.",
      "Several other targets are on the club’s radar most notably a centre-back. United have shown interested in Matthijs de Ligt and Jarrad Branthwaite - United have already bid unsuccessfully twice for the Everton defender. In terms of De Ligt, the deal looks more likely to happen now Netherlands have returned from Euro 2024.",
      "The addition of a top centre back, a fit again Luke Shaw and a consistently excellent Bruno Fernandes alongside Sancho and Zirkzee gives reason for optimism for United fans. They will be looking to secure at least a UEFA Champions League place next season with a third domestic trophy also in their sights.",
      "It means United could line up as following this season: Onana; Dalot, De Ligt, Martinez, Shaw; Casemiro, Fernandes, Mainoo; Garnacho, Zirkzee, Sancho.",

      "The winger spent the latter half of last season on loan at former club Borussia Dortmund, who he left to join United in 2021 for around £73million. Following a public falling out with Ten Hag shortly after the start of last season, Sancho found himself sidelined and out of contention at Old Trafford before securing a return to Dortmund in January.",

      "\"It's an uncomfortable situation for Jadon Sancho, the manager has won the battle in the end and he'll look for a way out of Man United now. If Sancho played under Erik ten Hag again and had one bad performance, everyone would be pointing their finger at him.",
      "\"Sancho is more than good enough to play for another team in the 'Big Six', he'll want to play for another top team. He might go on another year-long loan to a top club, maybe Chelsea or abroad somewhere like Barcelona, then he'll see if Ten Hag gets sacked, then he can kick-start his Man United career. If I was Sancho, I'd sit tight for a bit and negotiate a loan so I can see the manager's situation.\"",
      "Yorke added: \"He's very talented, but he needs to be integrated into the team. Sancho did not play with the talent he has because Man United's football is not free-flowing.",
      "\"Sancho is seen as a 'baller', but he hasn't been able to show that. Imagine going to work, where you're unhappy, would you perform at your best? No. Sancho has to go into training not happy, always questioning something, that's not where a 'baller' should be, he needs to play in a better environment.\"",
      "\"I think Sancho has a future at Man Utd under a different manager. If a new manager comes in, the slate is wiped for everyone.",
      "\"Sancho is a big asset, they paid a lot of money for him and he's a depreciating asset at the moment so they need to do something, whether that's to bring him back and sell him, utilised him, but to just leave him out on loan and get no benefit other than a contribution to his wages does not work for them.",
      "\"So a new manager comes in, I would say the slate is wiped. Let's start again and see what happens.\"",
      "\"At Dortmund, Sancho has gone into a really good dressing room, a good culture with good guys and he gets respect.",
      "\"At Man Utd, it could have been an absolute nightmare for him. He may have not liked the way it was or it might not have been what he thought it would be.",
      "\"Being back at Dortmund, with some of the players that were there when he left. He's playing with one of the biggest clubs in European football without a shadow of doubt. Why would he want to go back to United?\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho also had to say sorry to his manager after liking a social media post criticising his boss, after the winger was hooked at half-time during a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth. \"Alejandro is a young player, has to learn a lot. He apologised for it and after that we move on,\" Ten Hag said following the incident.",
      "Sancho was less eager to cede ground and his stand-off with the head coach ultimately led to his banishment from first-team training and eventual loan to Borussia Dortmund. The 24-year-old had taken issue to Ten Hag’s comments over his training levels and released a now-deleted social media post rebutting the claims.",
      "Ten Hag exiled him from his plans from September with the winger’s only route back in via an apology. Former attacking coach Benni McCarthy later stated Sancho felt as though saying sorry would admit guilt when he felt he had done no wrong.",
      "So with Sancho returning to United training this week for the first time since September, it seems someone has lost the battle. Either Sancho has apologised or Ten Hag has allowed him back in without one being offered.",
      "It is unclear whether Sancho apologised to Ten Hag in this week’s meeting, which concluded that both would draw a line under the situation and move on. He may well have said sorry. But if he has not, then his next step is obvious if he ultimately wishes to stay at United.",
      "Ronaldo - obviously - did not apologise and left. Both Rashford and Garnacho said sorry and were back in the team. There seems to be a clear formula, further underlined by Sancho’s initial non-apology stance seeing him frozen out of the squad.",
      "Because if Ten Hag is bringing him back into his plans and the player has indeed not apologised then he has broken the Dutchman’s precedent, and you can bet his close teammates will ask him what went on during that meeting.",
      "The meeting was described as positive but it is unknown whether United still intend to sell him this summer. MEN Sport revealed last month that the club value him at £40m and would not take less than £30m for his transfer.",
      "Sancho will be available for selection after Monday’s friendly with Rosenborg, which he will miss after returning back to training later than his teammates. What role Sancho plays in Ten Hag’s summer plans will be telling.",
      "The truth is, there is little known about whether an apology came forward in that private chat. But it seems clear that if one didn’t, and he wishes to stay at United, one should come forth before long - and maybe publicly.",
      "Ten Hag will be asked about whether Sancho did apologise, and the truth will become evident one way or another - a non-answer will indicate that one did not come forth and will perhaps give more insight into what the chat panned out.",

      "Spain have won every game on their way to Berlin and have the likes of Nico Williams and tournament star Lamine Yamal at their disposal. England will need to set up to contain their attacking threat while also providing courage of their own.",
      "Southgate has changed formation during the tournament but has only tinkered with swapping personnel. All 26 players are available for selection now that Luke Shaw is back fit.",
      "But should England make any changes to their XI for Sunday? Our writers have had their say.",
      "I'm not sure I would. Luke Shaw for Kieran Trippier seems the most sensible change, although England were considerably worse in the second half of their semi-final after that substitution so Southgate will have to assess both in training.",
      "The only other real question lingers around Harry Kane, but Ollie Watkins still feels better as an impact sub and it would be an enormous gamble to hand Ivan Toney his first start of the tournament in a final.",

      "There are calls for Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Luke Shaw, but I'd be tempted to stay the same - on the basis that Southgate is more bold with his substitutions.",
      "Shaw would make sense if he's fully fit, but can he play up to 120 minutes just two games after returning from injury? Both Watkins and Palmer are better options off the bench.",
      "Luke Shaw to start on the left, but I cannot see that happening as Southgate, maybe quite rightly, will not want to risk him breaking down and being forced into an early change.",
      "If Luke Shaw can manage at least 60 minutes, it is definitely worth starting him over Kieran Trippier. The Manchester United defender didn't look completely match fit against the Netherlands but the balance of the team is much better with him at wing-back as a natural left-footer.",
      "There is no real need to make any changes elsewhere, though it could be argued the likes of Ollie Watkins, Ezri Konsa and Cole Palmer come into the starting XI given their impressive cameos off the bench.",

      "Man Utd have made a promising start in talks to clear out unwanted members of the squad in this summer transfer window.",
      "Manchester United have been football's biggest underperformers in the transfer market in the last 10 years, but a new era is under way and things can only get better.",
      "The appointment of Dan Ashworth as sporting director was a coup and United's recruitment strategy will improve as a result, which points toward a brighter future. United did spend money with the Glazers as sole owners but it was spectacularly wasted and the hope is there will be fewer, or hopefully none, transfer flops going forward.",
      "However, United have struggled with selling players just as much as buying quality players for value transfer fees, and the club's record of offloading members of the squad who have been deemed surplus to requirements needed to be improved simultaneously. Fortunately, with the new footballing structure in place, work has started on improving United's selling record already and good progress has been made at the start of the window.",
      "Donny van de Beek's nightmare in Manchester seemed like it was never going to end, but a deal has been agreed with Girona that will bring the curtains down on his time at United. On Wednesday, the midfielder confirmed his exit with an emotional goodbye statement on social media but fans probably had their own tears - tears of joy - at the news.",
      "Van de Beek is likeable and never threw his toys out of the pram when he wasn't playing, but he wasn't good enough to play for United and his decline since his arrival from Ajax has been sad to follow, as he had the world at his feet but leaves with his career in crisis. Eintracht Frankfurt signed Van de Beek on loan in January and had the option to make the deal permanent for €11million (£9.55m), with €3m (£2.6m) in add-ons, but he was dropped after a few appearances and left out of their squad for Europe, which was arguably a new low.",
      "Van de Beek is clearly not the player he was when excelling for Ajax, so a permanent sale of any kind was required this summer and he's set to join Spanish club Girona.",
      "United have agreed a €4.5million fee to sell Van de Beek to Girona and just €450,000 (£380,000) will be paid upfront from the La Liga side. The Reds have made a 90 per cent loss on the fee they invested to sign him but it's a relief to see him finally removed from the books.",
      "Elsewhere, United have accepted a bid of £26.7m from Marseille for Mason Greenwood and the move will progress if the forward agrees personal terms with the Ligue 1 club. Ratcliffe was diplomatic and sensitive when asked about Greenwood's future in a sit down with journalists in February but it was imperative his sale was arranged swiftly.",
      "Greenwood being pictured with the United squad on the first day of pre-season wouldn't have been a good look, especially for an ownership attempting to distance themselves from past mistakes, and banking just over £25m for him should be considered decent business.",
      "United's announcement on Greenwood from August that said 'it would be most appropriate for him' to continue elsewhere remains true and his time at the club is ending. The sales of Van de Beek and Greenwood represent a solid start to the transfer window, but there are still six more players; Victor Lindelof, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Hannibal Mejbri, Facundo Pellistri and Jadon Sancho, that should be sold to raise funds for fresh arrivals.",
      "Lindelof, Wan-Bissaka and Hannibal have entered the final year of their contracts and will take priority, along with Sancho, who was unaccounted for when pre-season began on Monday. If all eight of the aforementioned players are sold - the list includes Casemiro - then United will raise significant funds, which can be reinvested back into the squad.",
      "They have made a positive start to shifting the deadwood and hopefully it will continue.",

      "Man United have been active in trying to get deals done during the first transfer window under Ineos but the situation could have been so much worse.",
      "There would have been butterflies in the stomach of the Manchester United squad on the morning of May 25. The FA Cup final at Wembley was do-or-die territory when it came to how this season would be remembered.",
      "But among the watching executives, especially Sir Jim Ratcliffe, there would have been a similar feeling of nervousness and queasiness ahead of the showdown with Manchester City. Ratcliffe would have been desperate to savour that winning feeling as a part-owner of his boyhood club, but the 71-year-old businessman would have also been aware of how just valuable this match was going to be.",
      "He had become the chief decision-maker at the club at a time of peril. Results had nosedived, the manager was under pressure and the financial situation was starting to look a little dire. An early exit from Europe had compounded matters and if they failed to win the FA Cup final, United would have gone into next season without being in any continental competition.",
      "That is disastrous for a club of United's stature, but it would have been even more catastrophic for the accountants. This was a club already battling against a breach of financial fair play rules while Ineos considered a range of cost-cutting measures, which have included making 250 of the club's 1,100-strong workforce redundant.",
      "Finishing eighth in the Premier League had denied the club entry to even the Europa Conference League for 2024/25, so winning the FA Cup was the last avenue into Europe. The Europa League doesn't offer the prestige of the Champions League and falls well short of providing the same revenue, but it does bring in plenty of extra cash, through broadcast deals and by providing a chunk of extra games at Old Trafford, each worth in the region of £3m.",
      "United, of course, took that final invitation, beating City 2-1 to edge themselves into the Europa League. In the process, they saved the job of Erik ten Hag, but they also made sure the club were capable of being a little more aggressive in this transfer window.",
      "We will never know just how different this summer would have been without that trophy. Ten Hag would have gone, for starters, but it would have also drastically impacted Ineos' ability to operate in the market. The accounts for the first three months of this year, released on Wednesday, are evidence of the kind of impact defeat would have had.",
      "Compared to the same three-month period in 2023, revenues are down 20%, resulting in a net loss that has climbed from £5.4m to £71.3m. Matchday and broadcasting revenue alone slumped £33m.",
      "That is primarily a result of there being nine fewer home games in that period compared to last year. Some of those are domestic home games in a season United reached both cup finals on the back of a string of ties at Old Trafford, but it also includes the absence of European football and those fixtures are almost always more attractive than FA Cup or Carabao Cup matches. They also come with a guarantee of being at home, with three games in the group stages and then two-legged ties throughout the knockout rounds.",
      "Had United been unable to bank on any European football this season it would have blown a significant hole in their finances. They are on course for record revenues of £660m for the year until June 30, 2024, but most of that would have been accounted for without even the Europa League to play in.",
      "Thankfully, that is a situation Ratcliffe didn't have to consider. Even with European football, United's initial transfer budget is only around £50m before sales. It would have been much smaller than that without it.",
      "It certainly wouldn't have stretched to interest in Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Jarrad Branthwaite and Joshua Zirkzee. The Ineos revolution is well underway this summer, but it could so easily have false started. That memorable day at Wembley was about more than a cup final and about more than Ten Hag's future.",

Real Madrid have long been seen as the front-runners in the race for his signature, but United have tried to get ahead by agreeing a fee for the French under-21 international.",
      "Lille are under pressure to sell Yoro with the youngster, who was present at Madrid's Champions League final win over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley last month, now into the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "The current European and Spanish champions have not yet matched Lille's asking price with any of their bids. If they do, Yoro will have three options to consider. Firstly, the 18-year-old could choose to stay at Lille and play another season in Ligue 1.",
      "After that, Yoro could either leave on a free transfer in 2025 to a club of his choice or sign a new contract. Alternatively, he might want to join United, who despite agreeing personal terms with Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt are still in the market for another centre-back.",
      "A fake social media account claiming to be Yoro 'rejected' a move to Old Trafford on Tuesday, stating: \"I don't want you @ManUtd. Leave me alone.\" But the player himself quickly corrected the misinformation through his official account, responding: \"Fake account. You guys are psycho. Signal this account.\"",

      "Man Utd's latest accounts cover the period of the Ineos investment being officially confirmed.",
      "Manchester United spent a further £30.3m on legal fees and other costs related to Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal to buy 27.7% of the club, their latest accounts have revealed.",
      "It was already known that United would be paying the fees associated with the £1.25bn deal for Ineos to acquire a minority stake in the club and the accounts for the first three months of the year have revealed further details, with costs associated both to Ratcliffe as the buyer and the Glazer family.",
      "The financial results covering the final three months of 2023 showed that £9.6m had been spent so far on the deal, which was agreed in December but only fully ratified in February of this year. A further £30.3m has now been spent on the fees connected to the agreement, taking the total to £39.9m.",
      "But the minority takeover also included an investment of $300m of Ratcliffe's own money, giving the club a cash injection of £234m. So far, £156m of that has been spent, including helping to finance the £50m investment in the redevelopment of the club's Carrington training ground.",
      "A large chunk of that capital has also been used to help reduce the club's revolving credit facility, which stood at £143m at March 31, 2024, down from just over £200m the previous year. United's latest financial results showed a net loss of £71.4m for the first three months of this year, up from £5.6m from the same quarter a year ago.",
      "That is as a result of revenue dropping by 20% for the three-month period, with nine fewer games at Old Trafford a primary contributor, thanks to a lack of home cup draws and an early exit from European competition.",
      "United's debt for the quarter remained $650m, which is unchanged from a year ago. A change in the exchange rate means the debt in GBP has dropped from £521.5m to £511.3m.",

      "Man Utd begin their pre-season campaign in Norway on Monday night and it's a big few weeks for a winger with designs on breaking into the team.",
      "As the summer transfer window cranks into gear, the new sporting structure at Manchester United are focused on incomings. It's been a busy start to the window for the key figures in recruitment as they try and give Erik ten Hag a squad that can mount a better challenge next season.",
      "But sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox will have one eye on squad management as well. Departures are essential this summer to fund a strong window, but United also find themselves in the unusual position of having 10 players out of contract next summer.",
      "That list doesn't include Donny van de Beek and Mason Greenwood, whose deals are up then but are close to finalising permanent exits in this window. Victor Lindelof is another who looks likely to be sold this summer, rendering a contract decision null and void.",
      "There are others whose futures could come into question as the window progresses. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Scott McTominay will attract interest, as will the younger duo of Hannibal and Facundo Pellistri. Christian Eriksen has just a year left, as does Harry Maguire, although there is the option to extend that by a further year.",
      "There will be no concern around Tom Heaton, who has signed that one-year extension, but there will be a desire to agree a new deal with Willy Kambwala, who made 10 appearances in something of a breakthrough campaign last season.",
      "But perhaps the most interesting figure with the clock ticking is Amad, who is now three-and-a-half years into a four-and-a-half year he penned when signing from Atalanta for £37m. It's not been a smooth journey for the winger, who turned 22 on Thursday, and he has made just six starts for the club since his January 2021 arrival.",
      "Three of those came in the final three Premier League games of last season and having looked like a near certainty to be sold at the start of May, his performances against Arsenal, Newcastle and Brighton might have changed the thinking. Against Newcastle, in particular, he displayed the kind of quality that suggests he might yet have a future at the club.",
      "The Ivory Coast international offers a goal threat from out wide and is a neat and elusive dribbler. In those three appearances, he looked an upgrade on Antony, who was dropped for the final four games of the season.",
      "Those displays may have convinced Erik ten Hag to give him another season. Ten Hag has been a ruthless seller of academy prospects in this age range and it looked like Amad was following that path until finally forcing his way into the team.",
      "Having had a summer without international football, he returned to Carrington on Monday and is set to get his first minutes of pre-season in Trondheim on Monday, when United take on Rosenborg. It could be the start of a big few weeks for Amad.",
      "United do have the option to take an extra year in his contract, a course of action likely if the plan is to sell him on, either later in this window, in January or next summer. But if he shines this summer, cementing his status ahead of Antony, then maybe a new contract and a longer stay could be in the offing.",
      "So there is plenty for Amad to play for in the run of friendlies this summer. He certainly hasn't totally convinced so far. He had a bright start to his Old Trafford career, then had an injury setback and a difficult loan spell at Rangers. A superb year at Sunderland in 2022/23 looked to be a kickstart but last summer he got an injury against Arsenal in New York and then had to wait for Ten Hag to finally hand him a chance.",
      "Having now turned 22, it is time to deliver on the potential that led to United paying such a substantial fee for a teenager with so little first-team experience behind him. His career has still only bought him 40 senior starts at United, Rangers and Sunderland.",
      "That has to change. A big summer can lead to a positive season, even with competition for places in attack likely to increase. Amad has to make the most of this opportunity.",

      "On paper, a choice between United and Madrid is a no-brainer. The former finished eighth in the Premier League last season and the latter are European champions again.",
      "Madrid are the biggest club in the world, they have dominated the Champions League over the last decade and they have just added Kylian Mbappe to their squad. They are expected to be an unstoppable force next season and Yoro only needs to look at Raphael Varane for inspiration.",
      "Varane was also 18 years old when he joined Real Madrid from RC Lens in 2011 and he won countless major trophies during a hugely successful stint at the Bernabeu Stadium.",
      "Back then, Varane was regarded as one of the most promising young French defenders and Yoro has that status in 2024. It wouldn't be a surprise if Madrid use Varane as an example in talks with Yoro because the pair have similar backgrounds and he is proof of what is possible to achieve.",
      "United have the challenge of persuading Yoro to sign for the club at the start of his career, instead of arriving at Old Trafford in the autumn of his career, just as Varane did.",
      "That won't be easy. Madrid have the clout to sign any player in the world, they can match any wages United offer and promise a career that will be filled with several trophies.",
      "United hadn't won a trophy for six years until the appointment of Erik ten Hag and although the Dutchman has won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in two seasons, the chances of winning the Premier League title are as slim now as they were when he first arrived from Ajax.",
      "If Yoro wants to play with the world's best players and have the best chance of winning trophies, he will choose Madrid and almost certainly won't regret his decision.",
      "Competing against Madrid for a player is a difficult task for any club, however, it would be naive to think United don't have a strong chance of signing Yoro. They have submitted an early bid for the player, which shows how much they want him, and can offer more game time.",
      "The defensive upheaval is ongoing at United after Varane's departure on a free transfer and the 'release' of Jonny Evans, who remains in talks over another short-term contract.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof are the remaining senior centre-backs. Lindelof has entered the final year of his contract and this summer is the last chance to obtain a reasonable fee for him, which explains why as many as three new centre-backs could be signed.",
      "Despite Maguire's renaissance, Martinez is the only guaranteed starter in central defence in the new campaign and the starting role alongside him could be promised to Yoro. That would be a significant verbal offer, considering Yoro's age and that United are making progress in a deal for Matthijs de Ligt, but it could be enough to tip the scales away from Madrid in transfer negotiations.",
      "While the promise of game time and a prominent first-team role might not persuade Yoro, it's the only advantage United have over Madrid and it must be emphasised in talks. Madrid have a deeper squad and possess more talent than United, which means it will be harder for Yoro, who made 44 appearances for Lille last season, to regularly start.",
      "It could boil down to whether Yoro is prepared to play fewer minutes than he did last season. United will do everything within their power to sign him - they will make a compelling case - but nobody will blame the player should he decide that Madrid is where he wants to play.",
      "Hopefully after 10 years of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership, it will be easier for United to persuade players to sign when other giants like Madrid are interested.",

      "Man Utd have released their latest financial results covering the period from January 1 to March 31 this year.",
      "Manchester United posted a net loss of £71.4m between January and March this year as their early exit from European competition hit them in the pocket.",
      "The heavy loss compared to a deficit of £5.6m for the same three-month period last year and reflected the fact that there were nine fewer games at Old Trafford in this quarter compared to 2023.",
      "That was mostly down to United's disastrous Champions League group stage, when they finished bottom and fail to even secure a Europa League spot in the second half of the season, but they also suffered from a lack of home cup draws which they benefitted from in 2022/23.",
      "Revenue from matchday and broadcast deals fell by £33.5m alone as a result and in total revenues dipped by a startling 20% in a year-on-year comparison, although the club are still projecting to deliver record-breaking revenues of £660m for the full year, mostly as a result of their strong start to the financial period, which included Champions League qualification.",
      "Club bosses have warned that the significant loss posted for this quarter further highlights the need to control rising costs, which is why Ineos felt they had to make 250 staff redundant recently, with that process now ongoing.",
      "There is also a desire among the new football structure to improve player recruitment, with sporting director Dan Ashworth starting work on July 1 and new chief executive Omar Berrada starting on Saturday.",
      "As well as seeing revenues fall, operating expenses also shot up by 15% compared to the previous year, an increase of £203.7m, of which £91.2m is employee costs and is reflected in the investment in Erik ten Hag's squad. That will include a higher basic wage for players as a result of qualifying for the Champions League last season.",

      "Manchester United transfer news as former academy ace could hold the key to Leny Yoro summer deal",
      "There are two transfers that come to mind with Manchester United's pursuit of Leny Yoro. The first is the deal for Anthony Martial worth over £54million in 2016, and the second is at the other end of the scale in Raphael Varane.",
      "One was a teenage prodigy came from France as a star of the future. Varane had been through his peak and come out the other side by the time he moved to Old Trafford, but as a Lens youngster and an undeniable defensive talent, there are comparisons to be made.",
      "Yoro has already been put up against Varane and is considered possibly the best centre-back France and Ligue 1 have produced since Real Madrid signed the four-time Champions League winner in 2011. Big shoes to fill and expectations to meet for Yoro, but with 60 senior appearances as an 18-year-old, and 46 of those in the league plus European experience, he has made fine start.",
      "It's no surprise that United are facing a battle to sign him either. Madrid have long been thought to be leading the race for him, simply due to the allure. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his new-look recruitment setup have given all parties a decision to make though.",
      "A bid for Yoro, who has played in France's youth system from Under-17 up to Under-21s and even the pre-Olympic squad reaching Under-23s, was accepted by Lille on Tuesday, MEN Sport understands, but there is a way to go still. Other sides are in the mix, and Madrid lurk.",
      "But United do have a way in here with Yoro. Not only have they shown ambition and a desire to sign Yoro, but they have links to the player which may well help them. Most notably, the player who has spent the fourth most minutes on the pitch with Yoro to date is former United academy youngster Angel Gomes.",
      "The pair have shared the field 51 times together for Lille. It comes to over 3,500 minutes of game time. After spending 14 years with the Red Devils, he has good memories to reflect on.",
      "Gomes was deemed as one of the best-attacking players coming through, described by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as a \"top, top kid.\" He even admitted that he saw himself staying at the club for his whole career, adding that he \"wanted to become a legend there.\"",
      "\"That was my aim,\" he continued. \"In the academy, I had great players around me and my goal was always to be able to come up and play with them, almost like the Class Of '92.\"",
      "His exit was emotional and tough but for most of his time at Carrington there was positivity. Should the pair converse, as is often the case when deals like this are being discussed, then United can hope for some good words from Gomes to come.",

      "Yoro, Martinez, De Ligt - Man United's astonishing defence which can solve Erik ten Hag issue",
      "When it turns to Varane there is more of a split. As an ex-Madrid and United man, who has recently left Old Trafford but shares a nationality with Yoro, the push may not be the way that Erik ten Hag wishes. At this stage it is all hypothetical though, and United have another possible ace up their sleeve.",
      "Yoro has played with Juventus' Khephren Thuram (albeit only once and earlier this year) but he has access to the midfielder. For the past five years he was at Ineos-owned Nice, so Thuram may well be able to offer insight into how Yoro could be treated under Ratcliffe and his sporting department.",
      "Thuram is one of the successes of Ineos ownership too. Having been signed as a young midfielder in 2019 he has gone on to become a highly-rated midfielder, earning himself a transfer to Italy this summer. Yoro will hope that he can have similar success in safely getting a move from Ligue 1 to a European giant.",
      "The final way United may be able to persuade Yoro is via Willy Kambwala. Although yet to play alongside each other, they are both French and still involved in the junior national team pathway. Kambwala is yet to actually play but has been selected for squads previously. He is certainly another able to offer a good word for United.",
      "Ultimately it may make very little difference if Yoro's mind is made up, but United do have a way in with Yoro, and must now hope that their proposal is the most attractive.",

      "It's been a turbulent week for Manchester United Women but the arrival of Dan Ashworth could be exactly what they need to get back on track",
      "Though Mary Earps' Manchester United goodbye message totaled 370 words, perhaps the biggest factor behind her decision to leave the club can be gleaned from just one: 'Transition'.",
      "Those 10 measly characters, deployed by Earps to describe the current state of play at Leigh Sports Village, rather concisely explain why one of the game's biggest stars feels the best thing for her career is to seek pastures new this summer. The 31-year-old's departure did not, admittedly, come as much of a surprise.",
      "Hers is an exit almost 12 months in the making, the portent of which can be traced back to Arsenal's failed world-record bid for her services last September. Still, though, in conjunction with a number of other happenings at United over the past few weeks, confirmation of Earps' leaving has been viewed in some quarters as an ominous indicator of the Reds' direction of travel.",
      "\"It's a decision l've gone backwards and forwards on for some time, and is not one I've made lightly,\" the England No. 1 wrote on social media on Saturday. \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don't feel it aligns with the timing of where I'm at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",
      "That new challenge is set to take Earps to the French capital, where she will become the highest-paid women's goalkeeper in the world for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). It is understood, however, United's offer of a new deal matched Earps' expectations and therefore her decision to leave the club is rooted not in finances but in a desire to be successful on the pitch.",
      "Clearly, the shot-stopper remains unconvinced about the Reds' ability to yield such success in the near future. Despite winning the Women's FA Cup - the club's first major piece of women's silverware - last term, it's hard to argue with the fact that United's performances in 2023/24 left much to be desired.",
      "Marc Skinner's side finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL), winning just 10 of their 22 league games and registering a points tally 21 points lower than the one recorded in the previous campaign. A 6-0 defeat to champions Chelsea at Old Trafford on the final day was a crushing nadir for a team who had taken the title race to the final day only 12 months earlier, and the travelling support took great pleasure in making Earps the chief subject of their derision, regularly taunting her with chants of 'Mary, what's the score?'",
      "There is an argument, though, that United's malaise on the field is a symptom of the pervasive uncertainty off it. It has been a turbulent year for the Reds, who came under fire last summer for letting star duo Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo depart on free transfers, with the latter joining WSL rivals Arsenal.",
      "Then there was the Mason Greenwood debacle, which opened a number of female players up to online abuse on the eve of decisive Women's World Cup games. Couple this with the departure of numerous backroom staff, including highly-rated assistant manager Martin Ho and head of women's football Polly Bancroft, and it is easy to see why some players may feel United is, at present, a club in flux.",
      "Those feelings have only intensified since the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe in February. The INEOS chief caused a stir when he opted not to attend the Women's FA Cup final in May, instead making an appearance at Old Trafford for what was, for the hosts, something of a dead-rubber Premier League clash with Arsenal.",
      "Days later came confirmation of a new contract for manager Skinner - a decision that was not particularly well-received by the United fanbase, in spite of the FA Cup triumph. And then there was last week, when it seemed as if every day brought with it a new PR fire for the Reds to put out.",
      "First, there was Ratcliffe's tone-deaf interview with Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\". Next came the revelation that Skinner's side are set to be ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp - and that's before you consider the exodus of first-team stars, including Earps and club captain Katie Zelem.",
      "Cue the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United; a dangerous cocktail of bad news that does not inspire much hope of positive change at the club.",
      "Still, amidst all the negativity, there are green shoots of optimism. According to BBC Sport, United are closing in on deals to sign Brighton & Hove Albion forward Elisabeth Terland and former Arsenal defender Dominique Janssen.",
      "The duo are at opposite ends of the experience spectrum but could both have a hugely positive impact at Leigh Sports Village. Terland scored 13 goals in the WSL last term, with only Manchester City's Khadija Shaw finding the back of the net more frequently than the 23-year-old.",
      "Janssen, meanwhile, has won two league titles and starred in two Champions League finals for German side Wolfsburg, having previously won the WSL with the Gunners. United are also expected to trigger the option-to-buy clause in the loan agreement of highly-rated Lyon forward, Melvine Malard.",
      "With midfielder Grace Clinton set to return to Manchester following a hugely successful loan spell at Tottenham Hotspur and the likes of Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa expected to play a bigger role following their respective returns to full fitness, the Reds look to have have the makings of a strong squad.",
      "Perhaps one of the most heartening developments for the women's team, though, came on Monday morning, when it emerged sporting director Dan Ashworth is free to begin work at United after breakthrough talks with former club Newcastle. The two clubs have come to an agreement over compensation after an acrimonious four months of talks, avoiding the need for an arbitration hearing to settle the matter.",
      "While Ashworth's priority will almost certainly be changing the fortunes of Erik Ten Hag's side, the 53-year-old has long been an advocate for investing in women's football and could be the spark United require to reignite their commitment to Skinner and his players. Speaking to the Guardian in 2022, Ashworth outlined the club's vision for Newcastle Women, who were, at the time, plying their trade in the fourth tier.",
      "\"(The women's team) is absolutely a priority for the owners,” he said. “Already, they’ve gone from a team where the players had to pay to play last year to being professionalised. We will do everything we can to give them the support to get to the WSL as quickly as possible.”",
      "His comments were reminiscent of a similar statement he made during his time as technical director of Brighton & Hove Albion. “The aim now is to get a foothold in the top division, being a new club and new women’s programme compared to some of the teams in that division,\" Ashworth told club media back in 2019.",
      "“We aim to do that by maximising our resources, trying to recruit cleverly, coach well and get the results to keep us in the division. It comes back to the club’s long-term vision, which is to make us a top four women’s team. It will take time, effort and investment to do that, but we’re on the right lines to do it.”",
      "By joining United, Ashworth is joining a club with significantly more resources than Brighton and with a bigger global brand than Newcastle. If he is able to lend some of his expertise to Skinner's side, there is a chance the Reds could soon find themselves back on the right path and their period of transition might just lead them into a brighter new era.",

      "The 31-year-old joins the French giants following the expiry of her Manchester United contract, having turned down the chance to sign a new deal at Leigh Sports Village. She is set to become the highest-paid women's goalkeeper in the world at PSG and has signed a two-year contract that will keep her at the club until the summer of 2026.",

      "Reflecting on her decision to leave United in a social media post on Saturday, Earps said: \"It's a decision I've gone backwards and forwards on for some time, and is not one I've made lightly. The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don't feel it aligns with the timing of where I'm at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly been blacklisted by agents in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos handed further headache",
      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe completed his minority purchase of Manchester United, he was keen to stress that he would not just be focused on the men's team.",
      "United were late to the women's football revolution but since earning their place in the Women's Super League they have become a threat. A fifth-placed finish last season was underwhelming considering they were runners-up the year before but the foundations appeared to be in place to regroup.",
      "However, in our latest look at the media headlines an admission by agents suggests this progress is no more which should be of great embarrassment to Ineos.",
      "According to journalist Katie Whyatt in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, the United women's team is no longer seen as a priority since Ratcliffe's arrival. She claimed that 'horror stories' have come out of Old Trafford regarding Ineos' running of the squad with agents reportedly telling their clients not to move to United.",
      "On Saturday it emerged that goalkeeper Mary Earps will be the latest United player to leave shortly after captain Katie Zelem was announced as departing at the expiry of her contract.",
      "What MEN Sport says: The revelations surrounding the United women's team and the lack of care that Ratcliffe has shown should bring shame on both himself and Ineos as a whole. The Reds' co-owner has often spoken about wanting to emulate the recent success of Manchester City and it is disappointing to discover that only expands to the men's team. In this day and age there is really no excuse to allow the women's team to go to rack and ruin. It also gives United a bad image which could taint hopes of securing major sponsorship deals at a time when the club needs the money. Ratcliffe needs to address this situation quickly before it does any more damage.",
      "Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake has told Dutch media outlet AD the prospect of moving to United is at the forefront of his mind but that he will not let it cloud his duty towards his current team. \"I owe it to them (Go Ahead Eagles to carry on as normal),\" he explained.",
      "\"It's not in the back of your head, but in your forehead. It can't get any crazier (than moving to United), can it?\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Since being linked with a place on the coaching staff at United, Hake has caught the attention of the fanbase. Videos have circulated on social media of his no-nonsense management style which many feel this current squad of players are crying out for. These comments by the Dutchman should also be warmly received to. It is clear that he wants to be at Old Trafford and is not against stepping back into an assistant role. It seems as though he is exactly what the dressing room needs at this moment.",
