      "Footy fans face another kicking this season as some avid football enthusiasts will be charged a whopping £7.50 per pint.",
      "A survey of the latest costs for a pie and a pint in the Premier League has seen clubs accused of ‘pushing fan loyalty’ with the latest prices. Fulham fans will be left with light wallets if they want a a pint during a match as their team tops the Premier League price table.",
      "Supporters of the West London club will now pay an eye-watering £7.50 for a pint of lager at Craven Cottage, which is up 4% on last year’s price of £7.20. London rivals Arsenal are runners-up in the lager league - as they have been in the Premier League for the past three seasons - charging £7.20 for a pint of Asahi.",
      "Man Utd have increased pint prices the most, after an eye-watering 51% increase this season. Prices at Old Trafford will be £5.75 for a pint of Madri, a rise of £1.95. Arsenal have topped the table for most expensive pie. Fans will pay £8.85 for a ‘pie on its own with gravy,’ the most expensive in the Premier League, compared to £6.75 last season, a whopping 24% price hike.",
      "Fulham is also home to the league’s second-most expensive pastry, despite dropping the price of a steak and ale pie by 50p to £6.50 - down 7%. The largest pie increases are at Everton’s new Hill Dickinson Stadium, where prices have shot up 54% compared to prices at Goodison Park.",
      "Fans will have to fork out £6 for a pie in their new home - compared to £3.90 last season. Consumer expert Scott Dixon, said: ”Premier League clubs are pricing out the next generation of fans. Hiking lager and pie prices by 50% during a cost-of-living crisis is tone-deaf and indefensible.",
      "“These mark-ups are less about necessity and more about blatant greed. This isn’t about inflation. It’s about clubs testing how far they can push fan loyalty. It’s time for clubs to reward loyalty and stop seeing their fans as cash cows to rip off at every opportunity.”",
      "Premier League clubs point out that they offer early bird discounts and bundle offers on food and drinks. Last season, Fulham had pre-game and post-game offers for every match. For this Sunday’s game against manchester-united-fc>Manchester United, the club are set to offer fans pints for £5 before and after the game.",
      "Manchester United said previous cheaper prices were part of a two-season-long discounted beer trial and that some new prices are still cheaper than they were three years ago. Everton’s pie price hikes follow a change of caterer at their new stadium.",
      "Chelsea and West Ham fans are already celebrating as their teams are the only ones to see lager prices drop. The cheapest pint on offer comes at the home of champions Liverpool. A pint at Anfield now costs £4.50. The least expensive pie is also at Anfield, with Liverpool charging their fans £4. Fulham and Manchester City are the only clubs to drop pie prices.",

      "Manchester United travel to Craven Cottage to face Fulham in the second round of fixtures of the new Premier League season. United will be looking to bounce back from defeat while Fulham will be riding high after fighting and clawing back a late equaliser at Brighton.",
      "The Cottagers will be eager to improve on their league performance having missed out on Europe last minute but with only one summer signing in the form of a second-choice goalkeeper, it will be difficult to achieve this feat. It must be incredibly frustrating for Marco Silva who has seen his side showed constant signs of improvements but has not been backed appropriately in the market in comparison to his competitors - including Ruben Amorim.",
      "Manchester United head to Craven Cottage with a near clean bill of health but a couple of big calls to make. It remains unchanged on the injury front for the visitors: last season’s match‑winner at the Cottage, Martínez (knee), and Noussair Mazraoui (hamstring) are still sidelined, while Amorim otherwise has a full squad to choose from.",
      "Marco Silva’s concerns also sit at left‑back. Ryan Sessegnon (unspecified) and Antonee Robinson (knee) missed the trip to Brighton, but neither has been ruled out of Sunday. Even so, Calvin Bassey remains the likeliest option to patrol the left of the defence if late tests do not clear the senior duo.",
      "Raúl Jiménez faces pressure after Rodrigo Muniz’s South Coast heroics. Up the pitch, Silva has a genuine dilemma at number 10. Josh King offers direct running, Emile Smith Rowe brings craft between the lines, and former United midfielder Andreas Pereira provides set‑piece quality and an understanding of the stage. The choice will colour how Fulham press and how quickly they can spring transitions.",
      "Fulham: Leno; Tete, Andersen, Cuenca, Bassey; Berge, Lukic; Wilson, King, Iwobi; Jimenez",
      "Man United: Onana; Yoro, Ligt, Shaw; Diallo, Fernandes, Casemiro, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Sesko, Cunha",

      "Roy Keane has questioned whether Marcus Rashford possesses the footballing brain needed to thrive at Barcelona. The Manchester United forward is playing his football in La Liga this season after securing a loan move from Old Trafford.",
      "The long-serving Red Devils star found himself surplus to requirements under Ruben Amorim following the Portuguese manager's arrival in November 2024. This prompted his decision to seek regular football under Hansi Flick at the Nou Camp.",
      "The winger made an encouraging start to life in Spain during pre-season, finding the net once and providing an assist in his early appearances for Barca. But Keane remains unconvinced by Rashford's prospects, questioning whether he has the tactical understanding required to flourish in Spanish football.",
      "During a discussion about the transfer window's winners and losers on the Stick to Football podcast, former United star Gary Neville said: \"Last one is Marcus Rashford to Barcelona. I know it's not a big signing in terms of the Premier League but it's an amazing move for him.",
      "\"I mean, I hope he does well. I think that him leaving is a poor reflection upon the club, but also him in terms of how it's gone in the last few years. But I just hope he can get his career back on track. What a move.\"",
      "Keane then weighed in, as he asked: \"Do you reckon he's got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle?",
      "\"Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to to make it work? He's obviously a talented boy. We know his strengths and that is running in behind. He kind of stopped doing that a little bit.\"",
      "Neville went on to suggest that a repeat of Rashford's recent struggles at United could be on the cards, given Barca's tendency to control possession in matches. He said: \"Well I think Roy, you're in Barcelona. It's maybe because I'm thinking of Barcelona 10 years ago.",
      "\"I know it's slightly different now but they dominate a lot of games whereby they are high up the pitch and you've got teams behind the ball, and you think Marcus is better when he's playing in a counter-attacking system. So when you're playing in tight areas.\"",
      "Keane interrupted Neville's assessment, as he said: \"That's why I think there are question marks, a little bit.\" Neville added: \"I know he plays off the left-hand side.",
      "\"But when United had teams that sat deep against him, you quite often saw him sort of run the ball out of play a bit didn't you and stuff and, just be a bit scruffy. But I mean look, his confidence looks like he's [on the up].\"",
      "Keane also said: \"I'm going to say hit just to try and get the feel-good factor out of it.\" Although he failed to find the net in Barcelona's 3-0 La Liga curtain-raiser against RCD Mallorca, Rashford is confident that he can rediscover his devastating form in Spain.",
      "He acknowledged his path to success won't be straightforward, as he must adjust to fresh tactics and a different division. Addressing the media ahead of the season's launch, the 27-year-old said: \"It's been a good pre-season and we're ready for the start of the season.",
      "\"I've settled in quite well and I'm adapting to the team and the coach. There are a lot of great players here - I already knew that. The quality and intensity are very high, and that's what we need to maintain throughout the season. It will be tough because it's a new country and a different league. I accept the challenge.\"",

      "Fenerbahce are reportedly willing to pay Manchester United's £40million asking price to sign Antony this summer - but the Brazilian isn't convinced about a move to Jose Mourinho's side.",
      "Antony is one of five players who were placed in Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' of unwanted players this summer, having enjoyed a superb loan stint at Real Betis. But with a permanent move to Betis not in the offing, the former Ajax player is looking for his next club after being frozen out of Amorim's plans.",
      "Antony scored nine goals in all competitions for the La Liga side last season as he led them to the Conference League final before an agonising 4-1 defeat to Chelsea and he showed he still has the quality to play at the highest level.",
      "And one of the interested sides is Turkish giants Fenerbahce, manged by ex-United boss Mourinho, who is desperate to win his first title since taking charge of the club last year.",
      "But according to ESPN, Antony remains on the fence about the move and would \"prefer to wait for other clubs\" - despite being offered a lucrative salary in Turkey.",
      "The problem for Antony, however, is that those clubs he is waiting on continue to insist on a loan deal - while United are hoping to secure a permanent exit for him.",
      "Other clubs interested in signing Antony on loan are Brighton, Bayer Leverkusen and Benfica - who all want to sign the player on loan.",
      "Antony himself \"does not look favourably\" on a loan deal, even though he had so much success during his temporary switch at Betis.",
      "The report says Betis also still hold out hope of signing Antony on loan again and Antony would not be opposed to returning to the club.",
      "Despite Leverkusen being one of the clubs linked with a move for Antony, manager Erik ten Hag - who twice signed the winger for both Ajax and Manchester United - has been quick to shut down the idea.",
      "Speaking to Bild last month, he said: \"He has great quality. I signed him twice. He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.\"",

      "They aren't the only clubs beset with fitness issues, however - while some teams have suspensions to deal with too. Ahead of the second Premier League gameweek, Mirror Sport has taken a look at every team's injury and suspension list.",
      "The Gunners losing Kai Havertz to a knee injury was a major blow for Mikel Arteta and he won't have the German star back any time soon. He is currently being assessed, having only just returned from a hamstring issue.",
      "Arsenal have a few other injury problems to contend with as well, new signing Christian Norgaard remains out for another week or so with a \"little issue\" that kept him out of the 1-0 win at Manchester United.",

      "Sessegnon could make this weekend's home clash against Manchester United after picking up a knock in pre-season, while Robinson is just weeks away from returning from a knee injury that required surgery last season.",

      "Hansi Flick believes Barcelona will \"see a great Marcus Rashford this season\" after the forward joined on loan from Manchester United. Rashford has been frozen out at Old Trafford by Ruben Amorim, but has been offered a lifeline by Barcelona.",
      "He made the move to Spain on a season long loan with an option to buy and debuted off the bench as Barcelona began their La Liga campaign with a 3-0 win over Mallorca, who had two players sent off in the first-half.",
      "However, Flick was critical of his side's performance after the game, accusing them of only playing at \"50 per cent\" after Mallorca went down to nine men. \"I didn't like the match,\" he told Movistar.",
      "\"These are three important points, but after going 2-0 up, and with the two red cards, I think my team played at 50 per cent. That can't happen. I need to talk to the players about this. You can't play at 50 per cent against nine players, that's not what I expect.\"",
      "Flick has been more positive ahead of Barcelona's second game of the season against Levante on Saturday, singling out Rashford in particular for praise. \"He gives us more possibilities,\" Flick said in his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"I know he's more comfortable playing as a winger, but with his strengths, he contributes a lot to our play. I'm confident we'll see a great Marcus Rashford this season.\"",
      "And Flick believes his players have \"got the message\" after his public criticism, adding: \"I've been a player, I know how these things happen. But what matters is that we need to improve, especially in games like that.",
      "\"We need to stick to the game plan, that's what I want them to do. That's what I told them after the Mallorca match. And they got the message.\"",
      "Flick also confirmed that new signing Roony Bardghji will not be registered in time to feature against Levante. \"He will not be registered for tomorrow. They train a lot, and this mentality, the attitude, he has the same as all the players, it's fantastic,\" he said.",
      "\"So he helps us a lot to improve the quality of the team. I can say this to Roony, but also to all of the young players who are training with the team, they are doing really good.",
      "\"But they also have to play, so I think they will play 45-60 minutes. And then tomorrow, we take one or two players with us to Levante. And hopefully next week, we will change something, and we can register every player.\"",

      "Gary Neville was bamboozled by Jamie Carragher as he quizzed him on where Manchester United will finish this season. He also accused him of being dishonest after hearing his forecast.",
      "When Carragher clarified that he sees United finishing either seventh or eighth in the table, Neville slammed his co-pundit and accused him of being untruthful. He said: \"You think they're going to be eighth?",
      "Carragher then replied: \"I think the best they can get is Europa League. They're getting nowhere near Champions League. Sixth, seventh, in the mix for that.\"",
      "Determined to extract a precise number from Carragher rather than a vague prediction, Neville asked again: \"What's your position? You can't just say...\" before Carragher replied: \"Well, what's Europa League? So is Champions League top five? Could be top five, could be top four.",
      "\"Let's say it's top five like last season. I don't see them getting Champions League, so they could be six, seven, eight. One of those positions.\"",

Thankfully, he managed to get a straight answer out of his fellow pundit that time round, with Carragher responding: \"Seventh. We'll do it in the middle. We'll call them seventh.\"",
      "It comes as the Red Devils endured a disappointing 1-0 loss against Arsenal in their Premier League curtain-raiser at Old Trafford on Sunday, with Riccardo Calafiori connecting with the ball at the far post from a corner to secure victory for the Gunners. However, there are hopes that Ruben Amorim's summer recruitment drive will bear fruit in time.",
      "The Portuguese manager could only achieve a woeful 15th-place finish in the table last campaign with the squad he took over from Erik ten Hag. Following the decision to support Amorim financially and grant him a complete pre-season programme to get ready, the United hierarchy will demand improved displays from the side this time around.",
      "The Red Devils have already splashed out over £200million on talents including Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, But they could still be poised to bring in additional new arrivals before the transfer window shuts on September 1.",

The Overlap, a channel that typically features Gary Neville, Roy Keane and Ian Wright, will show 20 games for the upcoming Bundesliga season. Mark Goldbridge's That's Football, which is usually divisive and tailored to Manchester United content, will also stream 20 games.",

The game can also be watched on The Overlap and Mark Goldbridge's That's Football YouTube channels, which have 1.5million and 1.4m subscribers respectively, and the Bundesliga's official channel.",

      "Jadon Sancho has yet to finalise his future this summer after being one of five players cast aside by Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim. The ex-England winger, 25, has not played for the club since the Community Shield in 2024 and spent last season on loan at Chelsea.",
      "After a disappointing season at Stamford Bridge where he scored just three Premier League goals in 31 games, the Blues paid a £5m penalty fee to send him back to Manchester despite having the opportunity to sign him permanently for £25m.",
      "Following his return to Carrington, he's trained away from the first-team and was even afforded more time before returning to training by Amorim in order to secure a move away. However, with less than 10 days to go in the window, Sancho remains a contracted Man United player.",
      "Despite time quickly ticking in the window, Sancho's future continues to be shrouded in uncertainty. There have been clubs to register an interest in the forward, namely Roma and Besiktas, as the 25-year-old looks to reignite what once was an extremely promising career.",
      "However, according to reports, a move to the Turkish Super Lig doesn't appeal to Sancho despite it meaning he'd reunite with former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who signed the winger back in 2021.",
      "Reportedly earning £250,000 on the five-year contract he signed upon his Old Trafford arrival, it's been claimed that that the Serie A side are reluctant to match his wages with Sancho himself believed to not be keen on a move to the Italian capital.",
      "While United have massively improved their attacking arsenal this summer with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, midfield remains an issue for Amorim.",
      "It was earlier this month when the Red Devils were said to be interested in Brighton's Carlos Baleba who enjoyed a stellar season with the Seagulls last year. The 21-year-old was said to be interested in a switch to Old Trafford but has reportedly been valued at around £120m by his current club.",
      "According to the Independent, United are attempting to figure out how they'd structure payments of the fee to Brighton, with one possible solution to be offering an £80m fee with the rest of the figure being comprised of add-ons.",
      "Another consideration, albeit unlikely, would have been to send Sancho to the Amex Stadium as part of the transfer but it's not seen as a deal Brighton would be expected to go for.",
      "The Serie A giants are among the handful of teams reportedly interested in acquiring Sancho this month. However, Juventus are said to only consider signing the winger if they're able to move on one of their other forwards.",
      "General manager Damien Comolli - who previously spent two years as Liverpool's sporting director from 2010 to 2012 - revealed the United ace is a target when asked about the prospect of bringing him to Turin.",
      "Per Sport Witness, the Frenchman said: \"I think the club is very attractive; many agents and players are calling me. After all, we are Juventus, and we want to get back to winning ways.",
      "\"Securing Conceicao’s permanence was a clear and strong decision because he can play on both fronts. We have two of the best wingers in the world, and Nico is a great player. If someone were to leave, we will consider him [Sancho].\"",
      "Sancho was assigned the number 25 when making his £72m move to Old Trafford in 2021 and had worn that number up until his loan departure to Chelsea last season.",
      "Thanks to his absence, the number - which the Englishman last wore in what is likely to be his final United appearance in the 2024 Community Shield - was relocated to Manuel Ugarte upon his transfer to United last year.",
      "Not only was Sancho left out of the matchday squad for United's Premier League opener at Arsenal, he's also not been assigned a squad number for the 2025-26 season, an indicator of his probable exit this window.",

      "Manchester United could still get their way over Rasmus Hojlund – thanks to an injury of a former player. Hojlund is on the transfer list at United after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko and it appears that a move that suits all parties could be on the horizon.",
      "United spending £74million to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig was always likely to spell the end for Hojlund at Old Trafford after a difficult 2024/25 campaign. The Danish striker managed just 10 goals in 52 matches last season and Ruben Amorim has opted to splash £200m on a whole new front line of Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Hojlund is part of a group of United outcasts that also includes Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia. United are keen to seal a permanent transfer for the 22-year-old, but had until recently only received interest around loans from Italy, where he has a good reputation following a spell with Atalanta.",
      "However, an injury to ex-United striker Romelu Lukaku has shifted the thinking at Napoli, where Antonio Conte is looking for reinforcements up front. The defending Serie A champions are likely to be without Lukaku until November and are warming to the idea of signing Hojlund after the success of Scott McTominay's move.",
      "Reports in Italy state that Hojlund is their priority in the remainder of the summer transfer window and they are willing to change their stance to get him. Napoli had previously been reluctant to go beyond a loan deal with an option to buy, but they are now considering an obligation to buy clause.",
      "That would come as a major boost for United, who are desperate to shift their unwanted players so they can reinvest in a No.6 midfielder. While Marcus Rashford left on loan for Barcelona, they have struggled to shift the other members of Amorim’s so-called ‘bomb squad’.",
      "Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two summers ago, but they are willing to cut their losses. He has previously been valued at around £35m, having scored 26 goals in 95 games for United altogether.",
      "Napoli do have other options, with Roma striker Artem Dovbyk and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson also on their list. AC Milan had been keen on Hojlund but reportedly now prefer Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic, while Lecce's Nikola Krstovic, Monaco's Breel Embolo and Sassuolo's Andrea Pinamonti are also options.",
      "Amorim left Hojlund out of the squad for their opening game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday and the Dane won’t be involved when they play Fulham on Sunday. Joshua Zirkzee was an unused substitute against the Gunners and also faces an uncertain future this season.",

      "Newcastle striker Alexander Isak faces an awkward return to the squad if a summer transfer to Liverpool doesn't materialise. However, pundits Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney share opposing ideas on whether he can rescue his career in the north-east.",
      "Isak, 25, has angered many around St James' Park after doubling down on his desire to leave Newcastle. The Swede was the subject of an unsuccessful £110million bid from Liverpool earlier this summer but continues to campaign for a move, even though that offer was turned down.",
      "Newcastle's frontman recently released a statement insisting \"promises were broken\" after he was supposedly told he could leave the club this summer. The Magpies have since responded with a statement of their own, denying those claims, putting the two parties at odds in an awkward stand-off entering the final week of the transfer window.",
      "But despite all that, Magpies legend Shearer still believes there's a way for Isak to earn his way back into Newcastle's good books. When asked by Micah Richards whether he saw a realistic route back for Isak at Newcastle, Shearer told his The Rest Is Football colleague: \"Yeah, I think so. Yeah, there is [a way back].",
      "\"I think it would have to be done before the transfer window closes, if that's gonna happen. And it's a big 'if. A huge 'if'. Because otherwise, it's just, 'Aw, I'm stuck here, and I have to play, or I have to do this,' y'know?",
      "\"He's made his feelings known. But yeah, I think there's always a way back. It's happened before. It was [Luka] Modric, wasn't it? One of a few, actually. Modric was at Tottenham [but] wanted to leave for Chelsea, I think? And was made to sit and play that season, and then he went to Real Madrid. And he was brilliant that season. So there is a way back. But I think it has to be done before the window closes.\"",
      "Brentford's Yoane Wissa has been touted as a potential replacement for Isak should he leave. However, if Liverpool don't improve their initial offer, there's currently no obvious destination for the Newcastle talisman.",
      "And it could lead to a very uncomfortable reunion at St James' Park should Isak be forced to stay where he is. Manchester United icon Rooney has made his feelings clear on where he would stand if he were another member of the Newcastle squad.",
      "\"If I'm a Newcastle player, I don't want Isak back,\" he said on his new BBC podcast, The Wayne Rooney Show. \"I think if players leave football clubs - and that happens all the time - there's a way to go about it.",
      "\"You can't go on strike, can't not turn up for training and train with your team-mates. If you want to leave the club or not, you have to be there for your team-mates and be ready if needed.\"",
      "He went on to say: \"For me, I don't think there's any way back for Isak at Newcastle. I think there are cases where it can happen, but from me as a person, I don't think I could accept them back.",
      "\"In terms of Isak's team-mates I wouldn't want him back. You can ask to leave a football club - that happens, or the club tell you you're leaving - but you have to be professional.\"",
      "Much of the football world is in agreement that Isak hasn't been the model professional after backing out of Newcastle's pre-season tour and being banished from training with the squad. And it leaves Eddie Howe with one heck of a repair job should the player be forced to stay put for this season.",

      "Lyon are already said to have seen an over from Everton, and Fofana has also been linked with Manchester United. The Ligue 1 giants are still in financial strife and require €40m (£34.6m) to be raised by the end of the month — the valuation of Fofana.",

      "Manchester United have less than two weeks to wrap up their transfer business, having already spent big to strengthen their attack with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "United have also signed teenage left-back Diego Leon, while Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy and Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have both departed after their contracts expired.",
      "However, plenty more incomings and outgoings are expected before the transfer window slams shut. Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia are all likely to leave, while Rasmus Hojlund could also depart.",
      "Manchester United's attempts to sell Rasmus Hojlund have suffered a blow after it emerged that AC Milan are prioritising a move for Victor Boniface.",
      "Milan are keen to sign a new striker this summer and sporting director Igli Tare had confirmed that Hojlund was on their radar. \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen,\" he told Mediaset.",
      "However, BBC Sport are now reporting that Boniface is on the verge of joining Milan on loan from Bayer Leverkusen. The report states that a deal for Hojlund stalled because the 'structure being negotiated did not include an obligation to buy'.",
      "Manchester United have been heavily linked with a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, but a clause in his contract could complicate things.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at more than £100m and it appears as though a deal is unlikely to be struck this summer, with United willing to wait until next year. However, reports have claimed that there is a sell-on clause which means 15 percent of any fee Brighton receive will go to Lille.",
      "And that means Brighton will likely still demand a huge fee for Baleba next summer as a £100m sale would see them lose £15m to Lille. Baleba joined Brighton from the French club back in 2023 for a fee of around £26m.",
      "Roma are among the clubs that have been linked with Jadon Sancho this summer, but reports from Italy claim that they are considering two potential alternatives.",
      "Tottenham are said to have offered both Manor Solomon and Bryan Gil to Roma and, although Sancho remains their top target, the report states that it is 'not a given' that the 25-year-old will join.",

      "Maguire is highly thought of by the United hierarchy and Ruben Amorim triggered a one-year contract extension option because his squad was “starved of leaders.” Maguire is determined to carry on playing, ideally wants another two years at Old Trafford and United blocked approaches this summer because they wanted to keep the loyal defender.",

      "Keane's father Maurice passed away at the age of 79 years old in August 2019, after suffering a stroke towards the end of 2018. For many football fans, it would have been the first time they saw Keane's emotions get the better of him.",

      "The winger committed his future to United earlier in the summer, with the club’s technical director Jason Wilcox playing a role in those discussions. That is unusual for an academy player so young and underlines the excitement surrounding him.",
      "Amorim was informed of his progress earlier in the summer and was shown video clips of Gabriel during United’s pre-season tour of the United States. He has reportedly taken a keen interest in his development and has now met Gabriel for himself.",
      "BBC Sport says Amorim has met Gabriel at Carrington and the youngster watched the opening Premier League match of the season against Arsenal from the directors’ box at Old Trafford on Sunday. He has now been told he will be given the opportunity to train with the first team on occasions this season.",

      "“We don’t want to hold anybody back. If you’re performing, you’re going to get rewards for it. They’ve played because they deserve it, and they’ve shown they can compete and fight at this level. We believe in a variety of experiences, so it’s important they play at their own age group, and it’s important they get tested [at this level] and they find things tough.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand's scathing criticism of Gianluigi Donnarumma has re-emerged amid the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper's potential switch to Manchester United this summer. The Red Devils are reportedly keen on snapping up the shot-stopper after a treble-winning campaign with PSG failed to convince manager Luis Enrique to keep him in his plans.",
      "While Manchester City have reached personal terms with the Italy international, United have been urged to jump at the opportunity to land his signature with his price tag proving a sticking point for their neighbours. Despite the Italian being hailed as one of the finest goalkeepers on the planet, Ferdinand has previously slammed the United target for one of his Champions League performances.",
      "During a quarter-final clash with Barcelona last year, the La Liga giants secured a 3-2 advantage over PSG to take into the return leg at the Camp Nou, with two of those strikes stemming from Donnarumma errors. He was unable to gather a ball whipped into his penalty area, allowing Raphinha to open the scoring.",
      "He said at the time: \"Highlight the goalkeeper here. In the first half, the goalkeeper makes two mistakes from crosses. I think in his head he's said, 'I'm going to stay on my line no matter what now,' and let the responsibility then fall on the defenders to defend this set piece.",
      "\"That's in his six-yard box. He's 6'7\" or so. That's a crime almost, not coming in your six-yard box and claiming that. It wasn't a ball that was too high. It was there to be attacked, but the impact of the first half mistakes lead to that. That's a player at the top of his game that is having to adjust his approach to a certain set piece because of performance.\"",
      "Despite this previous criticism, Ferdinand has also recently praised Donnarumma ahead of his potential Premier League move. On his YouTube channel, the former United defender hailed the keeper as one of Europe's finest, suggesting PSG's desire to part ways with him is due to the changing nature of goalkeeping in football.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"Did you see the stuff about Donnarumma? Wow. One of arguably the best goalkeepers in Europe last year, wins a treble. What I'll do is I'll give you the quote from Enrique, which was brutal right?",
      "\"But I kind of like that. You know where you stand, but I don't think Donnarumma would've loved it. But let's do these quotes anyway. 'Donnarumma is out of the squad as it's my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible.'",
      "\"He said, 'I want a different type of goalkeeper, and I made this decision.' Wow. Donnarumma is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world. Just that little caveat to cap it off. One of the best keepers, but just not my type. Now, we would have never seen this 10 years ago.",
      "\"If you are the best goalkeeper in the world, the top club who's winning everything at the time never sells you because you're the best goalkeeper in the world. He might be the best goalkeeper in the world in terms of saving the ball and stuff to stop the ball going into the net, but is he good enough with his feet?",
      "\"I think that is the question, and this is just the ever-evolving kind of identity of a goalkeeper now is very different. I played with so many goalkeepers that could barely reach the halfway line. Couldn't pick anyone out really on a consistent basis.",
      "\"Some could kick it far, but couldn't really have the direction to pick people out. Nowadays, you've got to have like pinpoint accuracy, short and long, over varying distances to be able to understand how to play through the press. If it's two people, three people, or one player pressing, like what's going on behind that press?",
      "\"The goalkeepers now have got to see so much, they're part of the 11 now. It used to be 10 players and the keeper; it's very different now. So Donnarumma is living in a different world of goalkeepers, and I bet people like [Gianluigi] Buffon, Edwin van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel, the top goalkeepers of yesteryear are sitting there going, 'Wow, not in my day, that would have never have happened.'\"",

      "Ruben Amorim indicated Manchester United have made no progress in discussions with Kobbie Mainoo over a new contract.",
      "Mainoo, 20, rejected United's initial proposal at the start of the calendar year and Chelsea were linked with a move for the midfielder in the winter transfer window.",
      "Although Mainoo has failed to regain his place in the United first team, their shortage of midfielders means he will almost certainly stay beyond the closure of the summer transfer window.",
      "Mainoo was 17 when he last signed a contract with United and his current deal expires in 2027 but the club has the option of an additional year.",
      "Amorim stressed it was director of football Jason Wilcox's responsibility to tie down players on new contracts. \"That part is with Jason, so he is our player. He has a contract, I didn’t hear any news about that.\"",
      "Mainoo has started only 15 times since Amorim was appointed head coach in November last year and the academy graduate was an unused substitute in United's opening Premier League defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Amorim started Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in midfield against the Premier League runners up and Mainoo was trialled as one of the two playmakers and even as a striker last season.",
      "The England international suffered two lengthy injury lay-offs last year and Amorim spoke optimistically about Mainoo's development during the pre-season tour but the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 system has jarred with Mainoo's skill set.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders and it is a different way of playing,\" Amorim reiterated. \"They have to understand, the young players, there are phases in the season. Nowadays it's normal, with a lot of games, things are going to change. But he is there, he is fighting, he is training, he is one more option for us to win games.\"",

      "It wasn't quite the refreshing new start Manchester United fans had hoped for against Arsenal last weekend but there were plenty of positives to take ahead of Sunday's clash with Fulham.",
      "United looked bright against the Gunners, with new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha the pick of the bunch. But their problems in front of goal came back to haunt them as United drew a blank in a 1-0 defeat.",
      "United will face Fulham on Sunday as they go in search of their first points of the season. Ruben Amorim spoke to the media today and confirmed Andre Onana could return inbetween the sticks.",
      "Onana was not involved in the matchday squad to face Arsenal despite being available to play, with back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir's mistake in the 13th minute settling the contest.",
      "Amorim hit back at suggestions Tom Heaton should be considered ahead of Bayindir, but Onana is expected to return on Sunday.",
      "Recap what was said in the press conference here.",
      "Ruben Amorim has warned United's 'bomb squad' members the onus is on them to secure exits before the transfer deadline.",

      "Read the full story here.",
      "That's it from today's press conference.",
      "We are better, but also because we have different characteristics and we can change that during the game. We have more options and you see we play a different style with Cunha, for example, and then in the end with Sesko because he is a different player and we can use. We are improving in that department also. We are creating more chances, so we are ready for any kind of game. The biggest improvement we had [vs Arsenal] was we didn't lose the ball so many times in build-up. That was really good also for our team.\"",
      "\"More important [than England] is for them to help Manchester United to reach our goals. Then they are very, very players, they are experienced and have played a lot of matches. Mason Mount won the Champions League and Luke Shaw, I've already said, when he's fit is really a special player and you can see it every time he players. So it's really important for us to have these two guys available for more games.\"",
      "\"We have some issues, but we play with two midfielders and sometimes it's a different way of playing. We, and they, have to understand, especially the young players, there is spaces in the season. This is normal with a lot of games, things are going to change, but he's there, he's fighting, he's training and is one more option for us to win games.\"",

      "\"That part is with Jason [Wilcox]. He is our player. He has a contract. I didn't hear any news about that.\"",
      "\"We need to try to analyse the opponent and put the best set up to protect the goal in set-pieces. We do it all the time and will not change because of the last goal. We need to do the same thing to the opponent\"",
      "\"I think it's always hard to play against Fulham. They have a clear identity, Marco Silva is really smart and they are really comfortable because they have experience and understand the league. It will be a tough match, but every game in the scheduel is tought to play.\"",
      "\"Like a professional player [how did he react to being dropped]. We need to see. Let's wait and see when the market closes and then everything will be clear.\"",
      "\"It's not an idea that these guys are going to leave, to play in a different club and then we'll recieve another player. We don't know what is going to happen, but we're not waiting to take out someone to get another. I think the players you are talking about are not with this group at this moment.\"",

      "Ahmad is currently serving his notice at Crystal Palace and his start date will be confirmed in due course. He is set to succeed Gary O'Driscoll, who currently remains in his post to ensure a smooth transition.",
      "Club sources have said they are pleased to have secured 'another high-quality addition' to their medical team, which has undergone significant change in the last 18 months.",
      "United's performance director, Sam Erith, has overseen the changes and was key to Ahmad's appointment.",
      "Earlier this year, it emerged that O'Driscoll (head of medical services) and Jim Moxon (first-team doctor) were set to leave. The pair are well-respected within the medical industry and both chose to depart.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "I interviewed Patrick Dorgu earlier in the week and the article will be published on Monday.",
      "United have confirmed the appointment of Stephen Torpey as academy director.",

      "Jason Wilcox said: “After an extensive recruitment process, we are delighted to have appointed Stephen at such an exciting time for our academy.",

      "\"Obviously, I have something in my mind about what I want to do and what I want to be. I don't want to put it out there to everybody, but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"",

      "United invited Gabriel to watch last weekend's game against Arsenal in the directors' box, following the teenager's decision to commit his future to the club for at least the next two years.",
      "Academy prospects would not usually be invited to meet Amorim and watch a Premier League game in the directors' box, but the feeling is that Gabriel is not an ordinary talent.",

      "The ‘drag-along clause’ means the Glazer family have the right to sell to a third party, and to force Ratcliffe to sell his shares; however, Ratcliffe has the right to match any such offer.",
      "Drag-alongs are commonplace in the business world. They make it easier for a company to be sold, as they prevent the possibility of a minority shareholder blocking a deal that the majority want to take place.",

      "That match at Old Trafford saw new signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all make their debuts for the club. While action on the pitch may have started, there is still work going on behind the scenes in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "United continue to be linked with possible incomings. With the club seemingly moving on from Brighton's Carlos Baleba, a midfield signing seems to be the priority with several names linked.",

      "“I don’t see that he has any future at the club at all. If you start playing with mostly midfielders as a 9 and you’re left out, that tells me that he won’t get any chances.",
      "“He has played the aces he had up his sleeve, and there weren’t many of them last season, in a very, very difficult season, so he should go to a new place now, where he’s loved and gets to play.",
      "“The only thing I don’t like is a loan agreement. I have to be honest. I’ve tried it myself, and it’s not fun, because you always fall down the pecking order when you’re rented, even if there’s someone who’s been bought for many millions.",
      "“But it may be that the best he can get is a loan agreement, because there aren’t many clubs in Italy that can afford to buy him, that’s the challenge.”",

      "Roy Keane has cast doubt over Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona this season, fearing he doesn't have the intelligence to succeed with the Spanish giants.",
      "The Manchester United attacker has been plying his trade in LaLiga this year, following a loan move to Premier League rivals Aston Villa in January. The longtime servant of the club ended up falling down Ruben Amorim's pecking order at the club since his arrival in November 2024, and is aiming to get his form back on track under Hansi Flick in Barca instead.",
      "The left-winger impressed in preseason, scoring and assisting once in various cameos to kick off his Barcelona career on a positive. However, Keane hasn't been initially convinced by Rashford, admitting he doesn't think the star has the knowledge to do as well as he'd like in Spain.",
      "While discussing the hits and misses of the transfer window so far on the Stick to Football podcast, ex-United man Gary Neville said: \"Last one is Marcus Rashford to Barcelona. I know it's not a big signing in terms of the Premier League but it's an amazing move for him.",
      "\"I mean, I hope he does well. I think that him leaving is a poor reflection upon the club, but also him in terms of how it's gone in the last few years. But I just hope he can get his career back on track. What a move.",
      "Keane then chimed in, as he asked: \"Do you reckon he's got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle? Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to to make it work?",
      "\"He's obviously a talented boy. We know his strengths and that is running in behind. He kind of stopped doing that a little bit.\"",
      "Neville went on to point out that a repeat of Rashford's recent campaigns at United could be on the cards, due to Barca's ability to dominate possession in games. He said: \"Well I think Roy, you're in Barcelona. It's maybe because I'm thinking of Barcelona 10 years ago.",
      "\"I know it's slightly different now but they dominate a lot of games whereby they are high up the pitch and you've got teams behind the ball and you think Marcus is better when he's playing in a counterattacking system. So when you're playing in tight areas.\"",
      "Keane interrupted Neville's theory, as he said: \"That's why I think there are question marks, a little bit.\"",
      "However, Neville concluded by backing Rashford to gain the momentum back for his career, adding: \"I know he plays off the left hand side but when United had teams that sat deep against him, you quite often saw him sort of run the ball out of play a bit didn't you and stuff and just be a bit scruffy. But I mean look, his confidence looks like he's [on the up].\"",
      "Keane also noted: \"I'm going to say hit just to try and get the feel-good factor out of it.\"",
      "While he didn't score in Barcelona's 3-0 LaLiga opener over RCD Mallorca, Rashford is, of course, backing himself to get back to his scintillating best in Spain. The forward did admit that his journey to the top will be tough, as he has to adapt to a new system and league.",
      "Speaking to the media before the season began, the 27-year-old said: \"It’s been a good preseason and we’re ready for the start of the season. I’ve settled in quite well and I’m adapting to the team and the coach.",
      "\"There are a lot of great players here — I already knew that. The quality and intensity are very high, and that’s what we need to maintain throughout the season.",
      "\"It will be tough because it’s a new country and a different league. I accept the challenge.\"",

      "The ‘drag-along clause’ means the Glazer family have the right to sell to a third party, and to force Ratcliffe to sell his shares; however, Ratcliffe has the right to match any such offer.",
      "Drag-alongs are commonplace in the business world. They make it easier for a company to be sold, as they prevent the possibility of a minority shareholder blocking a deal that the majority want to take place.",
      "For Ratcliffe to be 'kicked out', the board, which includes Ineos-appointed representatives, would have to vote in favour of a sale. And the Glazers must receive an offer that Ratcliffe was not prepared to match.",
      "The Glazers could only force Ratcliffe into a sale if the offer was a minimum of $33 per share because that's how much Ratcliffe paid to acquire an initial 27.7 per cent of the club.",
      "Ratcliffe's ownership increased to 28.94 per cent in December after he injected a further £79.3m.",
      "In 2023, Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe were in talks with The Raine Group, who oversaw the sale of the club on behalf of the Glazers, and both camps briefed confidence throughout the process.",
      "However, Ratcliffe won the battle and acquired a minority stake. Sheikh Jassim made an offer of around £5.5billion to gain full control of the club, but the Qatari failed to provide proof of funds during talks.",
      "Sheikh Jassim's offer included a promise to clear all of United's debt and included a separate fund directed solely for the club and the surrounding community, but his legitimacy was doubtful throughout the process.",
      "Regardless of the red flags with Sheikh Jassim, there is no suggestion that he could return to the table. And crucially, there is no suggestion that the Glazers are looking to sell.",
      "The American family get along with Ratcliffe and Avram Glazer has sat alongside the British billionaire at matches.",
      "Earlier this year, Ratcliffe spoke to The Times and said: \"To be fair to the Glazers, they're really good on the commercial side. The people who advise me say the fans don't want to hear it. So I've got to be cautious. I get a lot of criticism if I support the Glazers, but the fact is they're really decent people.",
      "\"They're East Coast, you know - that old East Coast America, they're very polite, they're very civilized, they're the nicest people on the planet. There isn't a bad bone in Joel Glazer's body. Part of the problem is there isn't a bad bone in his body.",
      "\"We have a very professional partnership with the Glazer family. They're really honest and straightforward, not what you expect when you read about them in the press. And they're both [Avram and Joel - the most involved in the club] passionate about Manchester United.",
      "\"I like them as people - to be honest, they could have given us a bloody hard time, couldn't they, after we cocked up with Dan Ashworth and Erik ten Hag? Could have, but didn't.\"",
      "The Glazers are believed to be pleased with Ratcliffe's investment since gaining control of football operations.",
      "The 72-year-old has put in $300m (£223) of his own money, which has paid for the £50m upgrade to Carrington, and has outlined an ambition to win the Premier League again by 2028.",
      "“Manchester United are the biggest football club in the world,” said Ratcliffe at the unveiling of Carrington's makeover. “I can testify to that because I travel a lot and everywhere I go, however remote, I always meet Manchester United fans.",
      "“Everyone in the world knows the Manchester United brand, so with those two things the club has to compete at the highest level, that’s appropriate to the brand and the size and the history of the club.",
      "“While a world-class facility won’t take us to that place alone, I think it is one of the key ingredients in the modern world. I think here now we have a world-class training facility.",
      "“When we first arrived, two years ago, I came to Carrington and we had a nice presentation here. It’s an excellent facility and I’m sure it was in the year 2000 but 25 years later it wasn’t quite what it needed to be for the top four or five teams in Europe.",
      "“It was pretty much the first big decision we made when we arrived, in the first quarter of 2024, to invest in this training facility.",
      "“There were lots of naysayers around, who said you’re not going to do that within 12 months, it’s going to be a mess, but I’m quite pleased to say that it’s come in on budget, on time and we’ve managed to operate all the teams here in reduced facilities but we made it work in that 12-month period.”",
      "It would not be within the Glazers' interest to show Ratcliffe the door at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Does anyone remember Tyrell Malacia? He's still on the books at Manchester United.",
      "Malacia was placed into the 'bomb squad' in July, alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, but it felt slightly harsh to categorise Malacia in that group.",
      "The Dutchman has not worked his ticket like Rashford, Garnacho and Sancho. Malacia is simply not good enough for United. Ruben Amorim looked at Malacia after his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in November and quickly decided he should look for a new club in the January transfer window.",
      "Malacia was shipped out to PSV Eindhoven on loan and he made just six starts in all competitions during that stint, which confirmed ahead of the official decision that PSV would not be signing him permanently.",
      "PSV won the Eredivisie last season, so perhaps it was unrealistic for Malacia to break into their side after joining in the middle of the campaign, but Malacia's performances since his return from a serious knee injury last season suggest he might need to lower his sights for his next move.",
      "Interest has been thin on the ground in Malacia since his delayed return to Carrington. The left-back has been training on his own and his agent is working to arrange an exit before the transfer deadline.",
      "Malacia's dream of succeeding at Old Trafford is over and he must be given a degree of sympathy because a knee injury curtailed his time in Manchester. Would Malacia have been a success at United without that injury? Maybe not, but it was a challenging period and he's probably just happy to be playing again.",
      "The 26-year-old initially played through the injury at the end of the 2022/2023 season. Injections were used to get through games. Malacia then underwent surgery but required further surgery after a botched first attempt.",
      "After 517 days on the sidelines, Malacia made his return for the Under-21s against Huddersfield in November, and an interview about his recovery was published on the following day.",
      "\"We spoke to the guy who did my [first knee] surgery and then we made the decision: we had to do something else. I had to start my rehab over, basically… I had one day to be disappointed,\" Malacia told The Athletic.",
      "\"Then I had to be like, ‘OK, we go again’. I think at the end of the day, everything I did, even if it was a mistake or something, I won’t even see it as a mistake because it’s a lesson.",
      "\"I think everything in life is already written for me. I had to go through this whole process to be where I’m at now, so I wouldn’t do anything different.",
      "“You can ask the guys at the club — every time I came in, even though I was feeling s***, sometimes they were like, ‘Oh, your energy is so good, you give me energy again… how is he still smiling, or how is he still working after this and this happened to him?’.",
      "“Of course, I’ve had some moments where I was like, ‘Oh, I’m getting tired of this’ but there’s no way I could ever give up. It’s not my system, it’s not in our family.\"",
      "Malacia was on a long road to recovery, but when he returned, he was not provided with respite because he faced an even bigger challenge: fighting for his future at Old Trafford.",
      "The defender was recently spotted training with a private coach at non-league club Trafford FC. He has trained alone at Carrington over the last month and was recently pictured leaving the training ground with Sancho.",
      "Malacia's time at the club hasn't worked out as hoped and all parties are hoping the chapter is closed this summer. United want to arrange a permanent departure and Malacia will be hoping for the same.",

      "Goalkeeper Radek Vitek will also spend the season in the second tier having joined Bristol City. Midfield pair Dan Gore and Jack Moorhouse have joined League One sides Rotherham and Leyton Orient respectively while striker Ethan Wheatley is also in the third tier with Northampton Town.",

Highly-rated forward Enzon Kana-Biyik, who joined United earlier this summer, has moved to Switzerland to join Lausanne-Sport.",
      "Despite that lengthy list more temporary departures are expected. Here are four United starlets who could spend the campaign away from Old Trafford.",
      "United are reportedly prepared to let the teenage forward leave on loan.",
      "The 18-year-old impressed at academy level last season and has been involved in first team training under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Biancheri has also trained with the senior Wales squad and is also eligible for Canada, who have made a play for his services at international level ahead of next summer's World Cup in North America.",

      "The left-back is widely expected to depart on loan in the coming days with United keen for the 18-year-old to play regular football.",
      "After internal discussions and the arrival of Diego Leon this summer, Amass was earmarked for a loan exit. Ruben Amorim gave Amass his first-team debut against Leicester in March and the youngster made seven first-team appearances last season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday are leading the race for the youngster, with other Championship clubs also interested.",
      "The 19-year-old winger was a late call up to the United squad for the summer tour of America.",
      "He scored in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth in Chicago and caught the eye with his performances.",
      "United are prepared to sanction a loan move and he has been linked with League One pair Stockport County and Barnsley.",
      "The centre back impressed in senior showings last season and may well be retained by Amorim for the forthcoming campaign.",
      "But the imminent return to fitness of Lisandro Martinez and the return to the XI of Luke Shaw mean United have plenty of options in defence when everyone is available.",
      "Fredricson was on the bench for the season opener against Arsenal alongside fellow defenders Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven, who are both ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Once Martinez is fit, minutes could be hard to come by at senior level for Fredricson and a loan could be explored, but given the injury issues that blighted United last term and the need to carry at least five centre back options to cover the back three formation, the chances are the 20-year-old remains at Old Trafford.",

      "Rio Ferdinand's brutal shakedown of Gianluigi Donnarumma has resurfaced following the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper's links to Manchester United this summer.",
      "The Red Devils are interested in signing the shotstopper after a treble-winning season with PSG wasn't enough for boss Luis Enrique to keep him in the squad. Reports suggest that while Manchester City have agreed personal terms with the Italy international, United could still be in with a chance to secure his services.",
      "While the Italian is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the game, Ferdinand has been openly critical of the United target in the past.",
      "During the 2023/24 Champions League quarter-finals, Barcelona took a 3-2 lead over PSG back to the Camp Nou, with two of the three goals coming from Donnarumma blunders. The goalkeeper failed to claim a ball launched into his box, which allowed Raphinha to break the deadlock.",
      "He said at the time: \"Highlight the goalkeeper here. In the first half, the goalkeeper makes two mistakes from crosses. I think in his head he's said, 'I'm going to stay on my line no matter what now', and let the responsibility then fall on the defenders to defending this set piece.",
      "\"That's in his six-yard box. He's 6'7\" or so. That's a crime almost, not coming in your six-yard box and claiming that. It wasn't a ball that was too high. It was there to be attacked, but the impact of the first half mistakes lead to that. That's a player at the top of his game that is having to adjust his approach to a certain set piece because of performance.\"",
      "However, Ferdinand's criticism appears to be a one-off as he's also praised Donnarumma in the past. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the ex-United defender hailed the keeper as one of the best in Europe, and claimed the only reason PSG want rid is due to the evolving nature of goalkeeping in the sport.",
      "\"Did you see the stuff about Donnarumma?\" asked Ferdinand. \"Wow. One of arguably the best goalkeepers in Europe last year, wins a treble. What I'll do is I'll give you the quote from Enrique, which was brutal right? But I kind of like that. You know where you stand but I don't think Donnarumma would've loved it. But let's do these quotes anyway.",
      "\"'Donnarumma is out of the squad as it's my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible.' He said, 'I want a different type of goalkeeper and I made this decision. Wow. Donnarumma is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world. Just that little caveat to cap it off.'",
      "\"One of the best keepers, but just not my type. Now, we would have never seen this 10 years ago. If you are the best goalkeeper in the world, the top club who's winning everything at the time never sells you because you're the best goalkeeper in the world.",
      "\"He might be the best goalkeeper in the world in terms of saving the ball and stuff to stop the ball going into the net, but is he good enough with his feet?",
      "\"I think that is the question, and this is just the ever-evolving kind of identity of a goalkeeper now is very different. I played with so many goalkeepers that could barely reach the halfway line. Couldn't pick anyone out really on a consistent basis.",
      "\"Some could kick it far, but couldn't really have the direction to pick people out. Nowadays, you've got to have like pinpoint accuracy, short and long, over varying distances to be able to understand how to play through the press. If it's two people, three people, or one player pressing, like what's going on behind that press?\"",
      "Ferdinand added: \"The goalkeepers now have got to see so much, they're part of the 11 now. It used to be 10 players and the keeper; it's very different now. So Donnarumma is living in a different world of goalkeepers, and I bet people like Buffon, Edwin Van der Sar, Schmeichel, the top goalkeepers of yesteryear are sitting there going, 'Wow, not in my day, that would have never have happened.'\"",

      "Michael Owen believes Manchester United should be doing everything possible to secure Gianluigi Donnarumma's signature.",
      "The Italian shot-stopper has excelled in his four-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain, though it seems his time in the French capital is nearing its end. Donnarumma has reached the final 12 months of his deal at the Parc des Princes and is searching for fresh opportunities after Les Parisiens brought in Lucas Chevalier as a replacement.",
      "Ruben Amorim has enjoyed a predominantly positive first summer in the transfer market with the Red Devils, securing talents like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, Owen thinks he ought to be considering bolstering the club's choices between the sticks, particularly given that Donnarumma is looking for a move.",
      "Speaking to the Mirror via 247Bet, Owen said: \"Well, when it all came out about Donnarumma leaving Paris Saint-Germain, I thought, 'Oh my word, whoever gets him are going to be a lucky team.",
      "\"I mean, he is unbelievable. He's literally one of, if not the best goalkeeper in the world. I mean, he would be the obvious one, but whether they can get him or not is another matter.\"",
      "United had to call on Altay Bayindir against Arsenal due to Andre Onana's recovery from injury and lack of match fitness. However, many supporters may feel that the club needs to find a permanent replacement for Onana if they are to improve on last season's disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "The Cameroonian has not justified his £47.2million transfer fee since joining Old Trafford from Inter Milan two years ago, and has been criticised for making several high-profile errors. While Donnarumma is a feasible option at the moment, given that PSG are reportedly only asking for £40m for the 26-year-old, United will face tough competition to secure a deal.",
      "Manchester City are currently at risk of losing Ederson to Galatasaray, and despite acquiring James Trafford in a £27m move earlier this summer, the youngster may need more time to develop before he can be a reliable starter. As a result, the Cityzens are rumoured to be interested in bringing Donnarumma to the Etihad Stadium before the transfer deadline, and talks are said to have begun with the European champions.",
      "However, a reluctance to meet PSG's asking price could leave the door open for their neighbours to swoop in for the keeper. With four Ligue 1 titles, five domestic trophies and a Champions League triumph to his name in the French capital, Donnarumma would likely slot directly into the starting XI under Pep Guardiola or Amorim.",
      "He also let in just 25 goals in the league last season and registered five clean sheets. Owen has also pointed out other departments where United would be sensible to concentrate on enhancing should they hope to climb back to the top of the Premier League.",
      "He added: \"Well, I mean, there are areas where they could strengthen. If they want to go and be a top team again and challenge for the league, then there's loads of areas.",
      "\"But just to get back into that sort of European places, then they've probably got a strong enough squad. The goalkeeper looks quite an obvious one that they might need to change at some point.",
      "\"They've not done much surgery to their team apart from right up at the top of the field. So, you know, they've got one or two ageing players in midfield that are going to need changing in time.",
      "\"They've got a lot of defenders at the moment, whether they've got many great ones is a question mark. But I think over time they're going to need to change a fair few players, but just to get them back up in fifth, sixth place type of thing this season, I think they've got more than enough to do that.\"",

      "Ugarte has a different profile and Amorim decided his qualities were best suited to replace Casemiro. Mainoo started two games in pre-season and they were both alongside Ugarte in the pivot.",
      "Fernandes made a few appearances in the No.10 role in pre-season, which allowed Mainoo a chance to start in the deeper role, but it seems like the pair are competing for the same role in the pivot.",
      "It seems Amorim views Ugarte and Casemiro as competitors for one of the deeper midfield positions, and views Fernandes and Mainoo as competitors for the partnership's other side.",
      "Amorim has tinkered with Mainoo's position since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November, which hasn't been particularly helpful, but it appears he has decided on which role is best for him.",
      "\"I think he [Mainoo] can play in both positions in the midfield. Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball,\" explained Amorim in the USA.",
      "\"I think he is a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. I think he needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I'm always on top of that with Kobbie, because he is so good sometimes but he can be better. So I have big plans. But again, like I said, one game per week, the competition is going to be huge.\"",
      "Amorim also said Fernandes' best position in his system is 'closest to the ball' and he started him in the deeper role against Arsenal, so it's fair to conclude that's where he sees Mainoo's future.",
      "There were valid concerns about Amorim's handling of Mainoo last season, with the signs suggesting his future might be elsewhere, but there was a change of tone when Amorim spoke about him this summer.",
      "Amorim was notably positive and seemed enthusiastic about working with Mainoo, however, he tempered expectations last season and said he still has a long way to go in his development.",
      "At 20 years old, Mainoo is obviously far from the finished article, but he is a supremely talented young player, and it would be a travesty if Amorim couldn't make it work this term.",
      "Not coming on from the bench against Arsenal is not a big deal and Amorim should be given a few months to work with Mainoo before any concrete judgments are made on his future.",
      "If Mainoo is a peripheral squad member by November, then alarm bells will be set ringing. United are competing in the Premier League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup this season, which means fewer opportunities, but Mainoo has enough talent to merit regular starts in Amorim's team.",
      "There is huge interest in Mainoo, given he is an academy graduate and was so brilliant in 2023/2024, but supporters will have to wait and see how the situation unfolds before rushing to panic stations.",
      "Remember Mainoo's performance at Goodison Park on his Premier League debut? Remember his matchwinner against Manchester City in the FA Cup final? Amorim must make it work with the Stockport-born lad.",

      "Manchester United star Rasmus Hojlund has been ‘offered’ to Bayern Munich as Fabrizio Romano reveals a top Red Devils target has ‘said yes’ to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all been signed this summer to provide Ruben Amorim with a new front three, while left-back Diego Leon has also joined the club.",
      "Outgoings are now key for United and while they struggle to find solutions for bomb-squad members Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, they’re also looking for an option for Rasmus Hojlund, who was left out of the squad for the opening day defeat to Arsenal and has been warned he faces limited game time this season if he remains at the club.",
      "Earlier this week, Romano revealed Hojlund’s preference amid interest in his services.",
      "He wrote on X: “Rasmus Højlund and his camp have made clear to Napoli, RB Leipzig, AC Milan and all clubs interested that he prefers loan with obligation to buy.",
      "“Højlund always wanted to stay at Man United…but if he has to leave, he wants the move to be guaranteed to feel total confidence.”",
      "A report on Friday claimed Napoli have made Hojlund a ‘priority’ target following Romelu Lukaku’s injury and are open to a loan with a €40-€45 million obligation to buy.",
      "But in what is apparently a ‘frantic search’ for loan additions, there are ‘reservations’ over Hojlund. His inability to score goals, perhaps?",
      "On possible incomings, after Romano said on Friday morning that United were close to an agreement with Royal Antwerp star Senne Lammens on personal terms, he’s now revealed that the goalkeeper has ‘said yes’ to the Red Devils.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘More on Senne Lammens and Man United story revealed today. Talks are well underway with Royal Antwerp on transfer fee close to €20m, negotiations advancing. Lammens said yes to Man United, no talks with Man City as their target is Gigio Donnarumma… if Éderson leaves.’",
      "The 23-year-old goalkeeper is viewed by many as the long-term replacement for Thibaut Courtois in the Belgium national team and could solve Amorim’s goalkeeping problem.",
      "The manager played his cards close to his chest when asked about a new goalkeeper in his press conference on Friday.",
      "“It’s not an idea that these guys are going to leave, to play in a different club, and then we’ll receive another player,” Amorim said. “We don’t know what is going to happen, but we’re not waiting to take out someone to get another.”",
      "Ruben Amorim kept coy on a new Man Utd’s hunt for a new goalkeeper but warned the club’s bomb squad it’s on them to secure exits.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly closing in on a return to Serie A, while Manchester United are stepping up efforts to make their next signing.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Andre Onana’s “feeling” on being left out of Manchester United’s squad to face Arsenal on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the third player that Man Utd want to sign as well as Benjamin Sesko and Carlos Baleba this summer.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘ready to step up’ their interest in a Belgian goalkeeper amid concern over an injury to No.1 Andre Onana.",

      "Ruben Amorim has refused to give much away over Manchester United’s pursuit of another goalkeeper, despite the club working on a deal for Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "The United boss is understood to be happy with his current options of Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton, but with Lammens close to agreeing personal terms, Amorim was asked whether incomings would be dependent on outgoings.",
      "“It’s not an idea that these guys are going to leave, to play in a different club, and then we’ll receive another player,” Amorim said. “We don’t know what is going to happen, but we’re not waiting to take out someone to get another.”",
      "His comments underline a professional, cards-close-to-chest stance. United’s move for Lammens is progressing regardless, with Fabrizio Romano reporting personal terms are close to being finalised while the clubs discuss a fee.",
      "Antwerp are expected to demand around £17m for the 23-year-old, who has been on United’s radar since December.",
      "United’s goalkeeping issues resurfaced last weekend with Onana absent through injury and Bayindir at fault for Arsenal’s early winner in a 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford. Heaton, now 39, remains the third option.",

      "While Amorim avoided giving a direct answer on reinforcements, he was more forthright on the United bomb squad. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia continue to train separately from the main squad and were once again challenged to sort their futures.",
      "“I think again, I know that is not a good thing to have players in this situation, but it’s clear they want to play in a different club, and that is clear,” Amorim said. “So we try to arrange everything for both parts to be happy, so I have to try to imagine to have the training with the guys that I think are going to be the future and the other guys are training and preparing for the next chapter.",
      "“When the window is closed, it’s a different history. When the window is closed, we have to receive the players and in a new life, anything can happen.”",
      "The Portuguese coach also offered a brief team news update ahead of the weekend. “Onana is ready to play like last week, so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper. Licha is out, Nous is out. The rest of the guys are fit.”",
      "With the transfer deadline looming, United’s rebuild shows no sign of slowing. Amorim might not be saying it directly, but the arrival of a fifth summer signing appears to be edging closer.",

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "14=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "10=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "9) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "3) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "2) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "",
      "1) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (albeit since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which still feels entirely possible because surely not everyone is as bad as Brentford – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "There are whispers already.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner."

      "The agent and mother of Adrien Rabiot has slammed Marseille, accusing the French club of double standards relating to the midfielder and Mason Greenwood.",
      "Long-term Man Utd target Rabiot has been made available for a transfer by Marseille, with reports suggesting he’s about to be ‘offered’ to the Red Devils.",
      "The Ligue Un side have decided to offload the France international after he was accused of being involved in a moment of “extreme violence” with former Norwich City star Jonathan Rowe, who is close to a move to Serie A outfit Bologna.",

      "So, it’s hardly surprising that she has spoken out in defence of Rabiot, accusing Marseille of “lying” about the alleged incident.",

      "READ: Transfer rumour ranking: New midfield target for Man Utd, trio in Rodrygo race",
      "“Here, as far as I know, there were no split lips, no broken noses, no shattered eyebrows. No one is injured, no one went to the hospital, there wasn’t even a doctor’s intervention. We know very well that this is completely false.",
      "“There was no unheard-of violence, there was an altercation. What I can say, and then Adrien will give his version, is that at the beginning, it wasn’t even between Rowe and him, but between Rowe and Geronimo. Pierre-Emile and Adrien came to separate them. And then it went freestyle.",
      "“But all we heard… The coach who has never seen that, while he is always yelling and barking… And, then, he was shocked? There is nothing shocking, it happens in every locker room, it has already happened and it will happen again. The punishment is totally disproportionate. Everyone knows it, they are lying.”",
      "When further asked if she thinks the club decided in favour of De Zerbi rather than Rabiot?, Veronique said: “It’s less problematic to change a player than the coach… Ah, I hadn’t thought of that! Indeed… It’s him or it’s me. Possible.”",

      "Veronique Rabiot later brought up De Zerbi’s treatment of ex-Man Utd forward Greenwood as an example of the Marseille boss giving a player a “second chance”.",
      "She added: “I just want to remind people that we can’t say ‘unbelievable violence’ if neither player is injured. I want to tell them to show us the footage… I still wonder how we can treat Adrien like this when we know all the sacrifices he made to come to OM. To mistreat him like this after everything he did last season is unbearable. That’s what’s most shocking.",
      "“I didn’t know people could be treated like this. He was so happy to be here, but in the end, they treat him like an outcast, like a bad guy… To think we’ve never seen this is crazy.",
      "“When Greenwood signed after hitting his wife, De Zerbi said we could give him a second chance. I agree with giving people second chances, but is it only my son who doesn’t get a second chance? I assume he doesn’t owe OM anything because he paid in advance. It’s OM who should thank him and not disrespect him.”",

      "20) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Tottenham\nOn Thursday, The Sun suggested that Arsenal were keen on Rogers, but Tottenham’s interest has obviously intensified since they lost out in the race for Eberechi Eze. We can’t see either club getting Rogers out of Villa before the deadline without doing something mental. Rule nothing out with Spurs, but it’s certainly a harder deal to do than the ones they have already failed to pull off.",

      "",
      "19) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Tottenham\nReports in Spain suggest Spurs have agreed a deal. Colour us sceptical. Very. F***ing. Sceptical. Rodrygo’s representatives are clearly trying to create a buzz around the Brazil star, with Liverpool, City and Spurs all said to be interested. The Liverpool links don’t pass the sniff test. Spurs are bound to do something big and probably daft before the deadline, but more likely is that they go for Savinho. Which could free up space for Rodrygo at City…",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nBack on the agenda after the winger remained an unused substitute in Real’s La Liga opener. City are keen, but only if Tottenham take Savinho. Which few at the Etihad were convinced is a wise idea, but Spurs might not come a little more forcibly once they have wiped the Eze custard from their chops. So to speak.",
      "",
      "16) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nJackson has been available all summer but £80million was said to be the price, which is obviously mental for a one-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly want rid of. It does, though, make £60million sound more palatable but even that is too much for any club that hasn’t lost their mind. Desperation, though, can make you do funny things and Newcastle are said to have been in touch with Chelsea in recent days. Bayern Munich too, and Villa continue to be linked, but Newcastle feel the most likely club to offer anything more than a loan-to-buy deal.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which might have scuppered whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane, but that hasn’t stopped them from talking it over with United on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million. Maybe the performance at Leeds will persuade Everton to pay up.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Angelo Stiller – Stuttgart to Manchester United\nYouTube searches for Stiller have presumably increased exponentially after it emerged on Thursday that the midfielder is on United’s list of Baleba alternatives. Of course, the Germany international would be cheaper and a more simple deal to pull off but United’s interest has not yet led to a conversation with Stuttgart so links are tentative. For now.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "9) 🔽 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race but some reports suggest PSG are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay, especially since they have already signed a very good goalkeeper. If only there was another club in Manchester who desperately need a competent goalkeeper…",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "",
      "8) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get id. RB Leipzig’s renewed interest could give Bayern the shove they need.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million but at least they seem to have warmed to the idea of taking back Nkunku. Which would free up some of the funds to sign Simons.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Bilal El Khannouss – Leicester to Crystal Palace\nThe Foxes playmaker is being linked with Spurs, Newcastle, Leeds, and probably a few other Premier League clubs but Palace appear better placed while they look for a replacement for Eze with £60million burning a hole in their pocket. The Eagles will have to spend half of that on either El Khannouss, or…",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him. We anticipate another less mischief-making offer after Monday night’s clash between the two sides at St James’ Park and the nagging feeling remains this will get done.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nWoah! Eze to Arsenal had been shunted from the top 20, with the Tottenham rumour placing as high as no.3 on Wednesday. However, Tottenham missed their window, opened for them by Arsenal’s original faffing. It seems that just as Spurs were about to do the deal, back came Arsenal, prompted by Kai Havertz’s injury and since the feeling always was that Eze would prefer the Gunners, to the Emirates he will go for a package worth £60million in front and around £7.5million in add-ons. Eze’s medical is booked for Friday after he says his goodbyes to Palace on Thursday night from the safety of the sidelines.",
      "",
      "There’s been a record spend in the Premier League this summer, but have you been paying attention to the transfers in Europe?",
      "It’s still all about Alexander Isak and there have been ‘bombshells’ aplenty after words from both Arne Slot and Eddie Howe.",
      "Should Liverpool really be spending all that money on Alexander Isak? Do they need him? Does he break their transfer policy?",
      "Rodrygo would be quite the coup for Man City, Liverpool or whoever gets him this summer, but the vast majority of players swapping Real Madrid for the Premier League have ...",
      "When Eberechi Eze completes his now-inevitable move to Arsenal, Morgan Rogers will be the last man standing.",
      "There’s a top-of-the-table Premier League clash to enjoy at the earliest possible opportunity, while the Bundesliga’s brave new broadcasting era has us briefly intrigued."

      "Casemiro started the season opener against Arsenal, and Manuel Ugarte came off the bench, yet neither convinced, leaving United still searching for the right profile alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Carlos Baleba was considered the priority target, but Brighton have shut down interest unless bids hit £100million, forcing United to consider alternatives.",
      "Other names such as Morten Hjulmand and Lucien Agoume have been floated, though none have progressed. There were rumours yesterday United would be offered the chance to sign a French international and former target.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs on X, Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller has now been raised in conversations at Old Trafford.",
      "“One of the midfielders on Manchester United’s list of options is Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller,” Jacobs said.",
      "“No guarantee anything develops, or that any midfielder arrives, but internal discussions taking place over different targets.",
      "“Stiller has come up in discussions as #MUFC now decide whether to sign another midfielder before the window shuts.”",
      "Stiller, 24, came through Bayern Munich’s academy before moving to Hoffenheim and later Stuttgart, where he has flourished over the last two seasons.",
      "His rise in value has been rapid, climbing from €5million to around €45m, and he made his Germany debut in 2024.",
      "His reputation as a deep-lying playmaker has been highlighted by Statman Dave on X, who described him as a “world-class distributor” after he ranked among Europe’s elite midfielders for progressive passes last season, averaging 9.49 per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga.",
      "Real Madrid were reportedly tipped off about Stiller by Toni Kroos earlier this year, though they never moved for him, while Liverpool and Arsenal have also tracked his progress.",
      "United’s interest fits with their recent Bundesliga focus under Christopher Vivell, with targets emerging from Germany throughout the summer.",
      "For now, no formal talks have taken place with Stuttgart or the player’s camp, but the discussions inside United point to Stiller being seriously considered as the club weighs up a late midfield move.",
      "United have ten days left to close out their window, and Amorim has been clear about the need for another addition in the middle of the park."

      "",
      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",

      "9) Sunderland – £142.59m\nNine first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham have all been strongly linked with Rodrygo, who is clearly not in Xabi Alonso’s plans.",
      "But they should perhaps pump the brakes after casting an eye over this truly appalling comprehensive list of honking flops who have made the move from Real Madrid to the Premier League, in order of transfer fee.",
      "",
      "19) Christian Karambeu (Middlesbrough, £2.1m)\nWe’re in absolute agreement with Karambeu, who insisted his move to Teeside from Madrid was a “big, big deal” on the back of two Champions League titles in three years for Los Blancos, to go with his World Cup and European Championship winners medals with France. Boro finished 14th in his only season before Karambeu upped sticks to Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "18) Davor Suker (Arsenal, £3.5m)\nBought as a replacement for Nicolas Anelka, who moved in the opposite direction for £22.3m, it’s fair to say Croatia’s World Cup 1998 hero wasn’t quite like-for-like, scoring just 11 goals in 39 appearances. Fortunately Arsenal also signed a certain Thierry Henry in the same summer.",
      "",
      "17) Fernando Morientes (Liverpool, £6.3m)\nHe managed just 12 goals in 61 appearances and later admitted he was the “worst version of myself” during a two-year stint as Anfield which was “killing me slowly”. Yikes.",
      "",
      "16) Jonathan Woodgate (Middlesbrough, £7m)\nAfter two injury-ravaged seasons at the Bernabeu, Woodgate returned to fitness and form at Boro before moving to Spurs in January in 2008 and immediately becoming the second-last (yes, the second last) trophy-winning hero.",
      "",
      "15) Njitap Geremi (Chelsea, £6.9m)\nArriving in the first cash-laden summer of the Romano Abramovich era, his always felt like a slightly odd signing after a decent but not world-beating season on loan from Madrid at Middlesbrough. After 19 starts in his debut season under Claudio Ranieri, Geremi was never more than a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, though we’re sure he’s perfectly happy with a haul of two Premier Leagues, two League Cups and an FA Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham, £8m)\nWe’re not sure whether Tottenham fans will be delighted or sickened by Van der Vaart claiming the Harry Redknapp side he played in with Gareth Bale and Luka Modric was “the best team I ever played in” having left Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema, Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy behind him at Real Madrid.",
      "That may well have been the peak ‘Spurs are fun but are never going to win anything’ period and Van der Vaart was a big reason for that, presumably swapping notes with Jamie O’Hara over their future roles as Tell It Like It Is pundits, colloquially known as ‘pr*cks’.",
      "",
      "13) Esteban Granero (QPR, £9m)\nHe joined as one of several ‘marquee signings’ among 15 in total in that mad 2012 summer which was entirely predictably QPR’s undoing as they finished bottom of the table.",
      "",
      "12) Claude Makelele (Chelsea, £16.8m)\nComfortably the best Premier League signing from Real Madrid, Makelele made 217 appearances for Chelsea, winning five major trophies including two Premier League titles and has one of the most enduring legacies of any footballer to play in England, with clubs now spending nine-figure sums to fill The Makelele Role, albeit for slightly more well-rounded players than the diminutive Frenchman.",
      "",
      "11) Michael Owen (Newcastle, £16.8m)\nThere’s a misconception that injuries stopped Owen from reaching the Premier League heights he enjoyed before moving to Real Madrid on his return to the English top flight. But he played 29 and 28 games in consecutive seasons for Newcastle and was just a bit balls, scoring 19 goals across the two.",
      "",
      "10) Danilo (Manchester City, £26.5m)\nWe would refer to Danilo as a rare misstep in the Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain era in a summer in which they also signed Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, who’ve done alright, but they somehow managed to make a £7.5m profit on the Brazilian after two years of not doing very much at all.",
      "",
      "9) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham, £25m)\nFor a famously miserly football chief, Daniel Levy does choose to spend Spurs’ money very strangely at times. He was entirely duped by five knockout games for Reguilon on loan at Sevilla to help them to the Europa League, and five years and 73 games after joining Spurs, the full-back is now without a club having left at the end of his contract.",
      "",
      "8) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal, £30m)\nOdegaard is presumably the recent example Rodrygo is hoping to mimic with his eyes on the Premier League. The playmaker was destined for great things when he signed for Madrid as a child but needed to leave to realise his potential, and while Rodrygo’s situation is different in that he’s proved he’s good enough for Real Madrid while still at Real Madrid, he will be attracted to a major role similar to Odegaard’s at a top English side.",
      "",
      "7) Raphael Varane (Manchester United, £40m)\nWe wonder whether Manchester United signing a centre-back with far more miles in his legs than his 28 years for £40m would be seen in more negative terms had it not been for his 30-year-old pal signing for £60m a year later.",
      "",
      "6) Robinho (Manchester City, £32.5m)\nQuite the 2008 deadline day for City, with Robinho arriving along with all the Abu Dhabi cash after their takeover of the club. The Brazilian announced his delight at signing for Chelsea in his first City press conference and manager Mark Hughes later claimed he believes he didn’t recognise him and was “expecting to see Sir Alex Ferguson at the airport”.",
      "",
      "5) Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea, £40m)\nThe ultimate close-but-no-cigar footballer in many ways as he’s never really been a key cog after leaving Inter for Real Madrid in 2015, as illustrated by him having four Champions League winners medals but not playing a single minute in the three for Real Madrid and just 10 minutes for Chelsea in 2021.",
      "",
      "4) Mesut Ozil (Arsenal, £42.5m)\nHe left Arsenal with a reputation of being work-shy, but mercurial may be a better description of an absurdly talented footballer who could do astonishing things with the ball at his feet but also often went missing in games, particularly at the end of his time at the Emirates. We’re not quite sure of the definition of a ‘streets won’t forget footballer’ but Ozil was somewhere between that and world class.",
      "",
      "3) Alvaro Morata (Chelsea, £58m)\nMorata has said he “stopped enjoying football” at Chelsea and that was pretty clear to everyone watching. “I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing.”",
      "",
      "2) Casemiro (Manchester United, £60m)\nThere was undoubtedly an uptick in Casemiro’s performances at the end of last season, but he had set a very low bar by his standards to hobble over and we are very amused by what looks to be a reasonably decent chance of him starting the coming season at the base of Ruben Amorim’s midfield after well over a season of desperation to be rid of him.",
      "",
      "1) Angel Di Maria (Manchester United, £59.7m)\nHe actually started very well, with three goals and six assists in his opening 10 Premier League games, and Amorim would bite your hand off for a forward with a goal contribution ever 126 minutes as Di Maria managed in his solitary season at Old Trafford.",
      "But he really didn’t get on with Louis van Gaal and his wife might be the only person in the world who hates Manchester more than Mr Di Maria.",
      "“The people are all pasty-faced, prim and proper… weird,” she said.",
      "“They’re walking down the street and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you or what. The food’s disgusting. All the girls are all dolled up to the nines, perfectly made-up and there’s me with my hair in a bun and with no make-up on.",
      "“We try to be closer when things go bad. I did not blame him for being there. I just told him, ‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it is already night at 14:00 p.m. in the afternoon.'”",
      "We’re guessing she preferred Paris like her husband, who got 92 goals and 120 assists while starring for PSG.",
      "There’s been a record spend in the Premier League this summer, but have you been paying attention to the transfers in Europe?",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘burst onto the scene’ to challenge Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City in the race to sign Real Madrid star Rodrygo.",
      "It’s still all about Alexander Isak and there have been ‘bombshells’ aplenty after words from both Arne Slot and Eddie Howe.",
      "Manchester United are being linked with a midfielder many people are pretending they know all about, while there is an agent-made buzz around Rodrygo and half of the Big Six…",
      "Should Liverpool really be spending all that money on Alexander Isak? Do they need him? Does he break their transfer policy?",
      "When Eberechi Eze completes his now-inevitable move to Arsenal, Morgan Rogers will be the last man standing."

      "There’s a top-of-the-table Premier League clash to enjoy at the earliest possible opportunity, while the Bundesliga’s brave new broadcasting era has us briefly intrigued.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Manchester City v Tottenham\nThe fixture computer has blessed us with a top-of-the-table clash at the earliest possible moment. Unless you consider Arsenal v Aston Villa on the very opening day such a thing, in which case you’re a damn fool. Even more so if you’re going to start indulging AFC Bournemouth and their Acme shenanigans in such alphabet-based nonsense.",
      "No, the second weekend of the season is the first time such a thing can legitimately happen, when you have a whole one game’s worth of compelling evidence of how the entire season might look, as long as every other team in the league is roughly as bad as Wolves and/or Burnley.",
      "Embryonic league table whimsy aside, it’s still a fascinating game. Historically, City v Spurs is already a fixture simply not to be missed by anyone for any reason. It has delivered goals, goals, goals and a frankly absurd number of pants-pullings by silly old Spurs.",
      "Last season’s 4-0 splattering was Spurs at their Angeball best against City in the very deepest depths of their astonishing season-wrecking autumn funk, but the wildest thing about that result is that it is only very slightly an outlier.",
      "Working backwards from that game, the Etihad encounters between these two during the Pep era have finished 0-4, 3-3, 4-2, 2-3, 3-0, 2-2, 1-0, 4-1 and 2-2. And let’s not forget that ludicrous Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2019, which City actually won 4-3 on the night as Spurs went through on away goals.",
      "It has been as close to guaranteed entertainment as the Premier League can offer. We’ve run it through the supercomputer and this fixture has the highest xN (expected nonsense) stats of any in the entire Barclays universe.",
      "And yet even without the fact it’s a top-of-the-table clash with sky-high xN values, it would still be the game of the weekend anyway for actual reasons. City looked a million dollars against Wolves last weekend, while Mohammed Kudus and Richarlison looked like absolute world-beaters for Spurs against Burnley.",
      "There were hugely encouraging signs for both teams’ seasons. But the phrases ‘against Wolves’ and ‘against Burnley’ mean care must be taken. We don’t yet really know how much of what we saw last weekend was these teams being good and those teams being rubbish. We have an inkling about which victory/performance was the more reliable long-term indicator, but we don’t yet know.",
      "We should have a far clearer idea about both teams after this game, even if it is one that itself has recent history for deception.",
      "Spurs, because they are Spurs, come into this game on the back of a week where they’ve once again decided to subject their fans to another of their trademark ritual humiliations for sh*ts and giggles, while also taking the bold step of unsettling and alienating the striker who scored two brilliant goals for them on the opening weekend. There really is nobody else who does it like Spurs do.",
      "But we already have a decent clue as to how Thomas Frank might set them up for this one. The Super Cup final ended in disappointment but for 85 minutes Frank’s 3-5-1-1 really did work strikingly well and if we’re honest we suspect Spurs would cheerfully take a 2-2 draw from this one.",
      "In a way, the transfer failings of this week and the summer as a whole make Frank’s job easier for this specific game. He can’t be accused of going too defensive when he has literally no No. 10 anyway.",
      "There seems no reason not to go to City and try the triple-pivot midfield that made life so awkward for PSG in Udine, while who doesn’t want to see Kevin Danso launching long throws at John Stones’ head?",
      "For City, it’s also a bit of a free hit in its ridiculous way. A sterner test than poor denuded Wolves could provide, surely, and one where a compelling victory would lay down a significant early-season marker about just how back they might be. But also one in which failure can just be shrugged off and put down to xN.",

      "Player to watch: Eberechi Eze\nA good way to endear yourself to a new club’s fanbase is to have completely pied off their biggest rivals along the way. Emmanuel Petit knew it. Willian knew it. Eden Hazard knew it. But perhaps nobody has ever known it quite like Eberechi Eze, who kept Spurs on the hook until Arsenal’s time of need was upon them.",
      "Spurs must have known this could happen, and that it would look just awful – especially in the wake of the Morgan Gibbs-White fiasco. We do think Eze would have joined Spurs, but we do think it would only have happened once he was absolutely definitely certain Arsenal weren’t coming back.",
      "The whole ‘Oh he just wants to play in the Conference League qualifier to help Palace out before he leaves’ turned out to be the bullsh*t it always appeared to be, a convenient way to drag a transfer out even when dealing with the arch transfer-dragger-out himself in Daniel Levy.",
      "The result is Eze being an absolute hero to Arsenal fans before he’s even kicked a ball for them. It’s a lovely place to be. And it’s distinctly possible he still won’t kick a ball this weekend, but he’s still going to be the player to watch.",
      "He’ll surely at the very least be presented to the crowd before Arsenal’s opening home game of the season against Leeds, and should help ensure a buoyant atmosphere. There will be songs. There will be p*ss-taking. There will be endless shots of Eze in the stands watching on and penny-for-his-thoughtsing from the commentators.",

      "Team to watch: Manchester United\nThere was a lot to like about Manchester United’s performance against Arsenal on the opening weekend, but any optimism from that narrow, unfortunate defeat will dissipate quickly if they don’t get a result at Fulham this weekend.",
      "United were simply unready and unprepared for the start of the new season, still stuck with the same utter absence of reliable goalkeepers. It is staggering to us how often really big clubs do this. The window may be open until September 1, but the start of the season is in mid-August, and those games do still count. It wasn’t sprung on United with no notice.",
      "Another week has passed and nothing has been done to address the most obvious and glaring of issues.",
      "Fulham were as lucky to nab a point at Brighton as United were unlucky to walk away with nothing against Arsenal, but they represent a deeply awkward second fixture given the way the first one has gone.",
      "Fulham away is nobody’s idea of an easy game. It is not one where victory would normally necessarily be mandatory. But for United, after last season and the way the opening weekend panned out, it already feels like one where the result is of far greater importance than performance.",
      "This is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. You can’t be taking the positives if you find yourself with one point or worse from two games after finishing 15th the previous season and when the flaws in your squad are and remain so very, very obvious.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: David Moyes\nIt will be a proud moment when Moyes leads his Everton team out against Brighton for the first ever Premier League match at their magnificent new stadium, but one that he surely approaches now with a touch of trepidation.",
      "The wave of optimism he and Everton rode on his return to the club last season has crashed, and Monday night’s effort at Leeds was a pretty pitiful one for an established Premier League club against a newly-promoted one.",
      "Everton were passive and ponderous, allowing Leeds to set the tone and tempo of the game throughout. It nearly delivered a point – although for what it’s worth we simply cannot understand the fuss around the penalty given the way James Tarkowski moved his arm towards a ball coming at him from such a distance – but it wasn’t exactly a showing to inspire confidence for the season ahead.",
      "A new stadium is blessing and curse, with home advantage no longer quite the familiar helping hand it once was as everyone gets used to the new surroundings. Yet Everton and Moyes cannot afford to make a slow start to life on the docks if the club is to avoid the kind of worries and anxiety that have been all too common in recent Premier League seasons.",

      "Football League game to watch: Charlton v Leicester\nIt’s not been a convincing start to life back in the Championship for Leicester, who needed a late goal to beat existential dread’s Sheffield Wednesday at home and then lost at Preston having also gone out of the Carabao to League One Huddersfield.",
      "Charlton, meanwhile, are at this early stage faring rather better on their own return to the second tier from the other direction having beaten Watford, drawn with Bristol City and avoided Carabao banana skins (their newest flavour of surely deliberately undrinkably unpleasant energy drink).",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig\nWe don’t normally include Friday night games in here, but come on. Bayern v Leipzig would be a fine opening night Bundesliga game in a regular season. But now it comes with added Mark Goldbridge. You have to admit you’re intrigued.",

But out of sheer morbid fascination if nothing else we’ll be watching to see just how and how quickly the world’s most Deliberate Partridge performatively perma-furious internet ragebaiter manages to make Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig all about Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",

      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "10) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "13) Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain) – £54.3m rising to £57m with add-ons\nBournemouth held firm for as long as they could but were only able to resist the European champions for so long before making their third sale of a defender for at least £40m this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "15) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",
      "16) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nChelsea didn’t have enough forwards already.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nThere was an actual petition launched against the signing of Madueke, who might well have come in handy last season when it turned out Raheem Sterling was no Bukayo Saka.",

      "18) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",

      "So that’s matchday one of the new Premier League season in the books.",
      "We can already jerk those knees and draw some pretty nailed-on conclusions based on what we saw, but how about what we didn’t see?",
      "Here, then, is a list of all those players who didn’t even make it as far as the bench on the opening weekend of the season, ranked by how p*ssed off they might be feeling about it.",
      "And no we didn’t fully understand when we started just how massive this was going to get. We are and remain idiots incapable of working out the kind of final answer a sum roughly working out at 20 x 5 might produce. But we are also blaming Sunderland for having just too many players and turning our brain into absolute mush.",
      "On which note, sorry if any injured or suspended players have slipped through the net here. Call us names in the comments by all means. But we’ve tried our best to sieve them out, as well as not including any players signed in the few days or so before the opening games for whom day-one absence is largely to be expected.",
      "",
      "97) Renato Veiga (Chelsea)\nHe’s off to Villarreal, with Chelsea somehow turning a profit and even securing a 40% sell-on clause. It’s essentially witchcraft at this point.",
      "",
      "96) Carlos Miguel (Nottingham Forest)\nThe Brazilian keeper has since returned to his homeland and signed for Palmeiras after a single year in Nottingham spent almost exclusively watching Matz Sels from the bench. Fair enough, in every way from every angle.",
      "",
      "95) Marko Stamenic (Nottingham Forest)\nMidfielder who arrived in 2024, spent a season at Olympiakos and has now left on a permanent deal to Swansea. Nothing to see here.",
      "",
      "94) Andrew Moran (Brighton)\nOn his way to play alongside Son Heung-min at LAFC. There are worse loan moves, we reckon.",
      "",
      "93) Alex Moreno (Aston Villa)\nOn his way to Girona any moment now.",
      "",
      "92) Leon Bailey (Aston Villa)\nJoined Roma on loan this week, which was nice, and then immediately got injured during his first training session, which was not.",
      "CHECK OUT: Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "",
      "91) John Ruddy (Newcastle)\nPossibly the peak veteran-keeper-having-a-lovely-time among the third-choicers in the Premier League now Scott Carson has finally bowed out as a hero and national treasure.",
      "",
      "90) Remi Matthews (Crystal Palace)\nMore absolutely textbook ‘veteran third-choice keeper living his best life’ areas here.",
      "",
      "89) Freddie Woodman (Liverpool)\nWe’d imagine Woodman was under no illusions about his status when joining Liverpool this summer.",
      "",
      "88) Armin Pecsi (Liverpool)\nThere’s a lot of hype around the young Hungarian keeper, but he’s clearly one for the future rather than present.",
      "",
      "87) Tom McGill (Brighton)\nThe Canadian keeper has been with Brighton since he was 14 and signed a contract extension this summer that will mean he’s spent almost half his life at Brighton if he sees it out. Has never played a first-team game for them.",
      "",
      "86) Ellery Balcombe (Brentford)\nSpells at St Mirren and Motherwell last season took his tally of loan moves to nine during his Brentford career, with every chance he hits double figures in the next week or so.",
      "",
      "85) Mark Gillespie (Newcastle)\nExtended his contract in the summer for another year, presumably in full and happy knowledge of precisely what his role would be, and that this role was not ‘first-choice goalkeeper for Champions League club’.",
      "",
      "84) Brandon Austin (Tottenham)\nDid himself no harm when called upon on occasion in the depths of Tottenham’s injury hell last season, but very much third choice behind Guglielmo Vicario and Antonin Kinsky at this time. That he was also the only fit and available first-team-adjacent player at Spurs who wasn’t named in Thomas Frank’s first Premier League matchday squad is definitely nothing to worry about.",
      "",
      "83) Vaclav Hladky (Burnley)\nMade one appearance for Burnley in the Championship. Odds-against to match that in the Premier League even without James Trafford in the way.",
      "",
      "82) Alex Paulsen (Bournemouth)\nThe Kiwi back-up keeper has been linked with a move north of the border, with St Mirren and Hibernian both interested.",

      "81) Matthew Cox (Brentford)\nFourth-choice keeper at this moment. Will either go out on loan himself, or be promoted to third-choice keeper when Ellery Balcombe gets the tenth loan of his Brentford career.",
      "",
      "80) Blondy Nna Noukou (Sunderland)\nReserve keeper who made it as far as the bench in four Championship games last season. Can’t have been too surprised to see his name missing from the first Premier League squad of the season.",
      "",
      "79) Luis Sinisterra (Bournemouth)\nAn injury-hit campaign last season has been followed by a summer of uncertainty. Left out of the Friday night trip to Liverpool as talks continued over a loan to Cruzeiro in Brazil.",
      "",
      "78) Daniel Bentley (Wolves)\nDid play a couple of Premier League games late last season, but still has Jose Sa and Sam Johnstone and thus is, we imagine, well aware of his place. Plus being as far away as possible from a 4-0 home defeat to Man City is probably quite shrewd in the long run.",
      "",
      "77) Simon Moore (Sunderland)\nMid-30s keepers signed to be back-up in the Championship very rarely move up that pecking order after promotion.",
      "",
      "76) Alex Cairns (Leeds)\nPlayed one Championship game for Leeds. In 2011/12. Returned to the club last season and surely knows exactly where he stands, which isn’t necessarily true for all spare Leeds keepers at this time.",
      "",
      "75) Gabriel Slonina (Chelsea)\nA Club World Cup winner despite not yet playing a senior game for Chelsea, but no goalkeeper on the Blues’ books can be without a chance. It is a position where Chelsea have enormous breadth but no actual depth.",
      "",
      "74) Lewis Dobbin (Aston Villa)\nOne of last season’s entirely normal and unremarkable late June transfers between clubs in PSR strife and there was absolutely nothing to see here. Has yet to play a game for Aston Villa and that’s unlikely to change this season or, very possibly, ever. Spent last season on loan at West Brom and then Norwich, and another Championship loan is surely on the cards.",
      "",
      "73) Ian Poveda (Sunderland)\nDidn’t feature in pre-season, didn’t feature in the opening-day win over West Ham, is very obviously clear to leave the club. Did contribute a pair of assists for the Under-21s in a 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on Monday night.",
      "",
      "72) Chris Mepham (Bournemouth)\nHad a brilliant season on loan at Sunderland and there was plenty of expectation that might become a more permanent arrangement. Now apparently on the radar of Wrexham who – little-known fact for you here – have famous owners.",
      "",
      "71) Romain Faivre (Bournemouth)\nLeft Lyon for the south coast in the summer of 2023 but has still spent far more time in France than England since then after loans at Lorient and Brest. Has made only five brief substitute appearances in the Premier League and doesn’t appear likely to add to those any time soon.",
      "",
      "70) Timothee Pembele (Sunderland)\nFell out of favour last season, spent time on loan with Le Havre in France, is not part of the Black Cats’ grand Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "69) Abdoullah Ba (Sunderland)\nFell out of favour last season, spent time on loan with USL Dunkerque in France, is not part of the Black Cats’ grand Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "68) Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\nJoined Burnley for a third time after signing from Norwich in January following 18 months away and declared he had ‘unfinished business’ upon signing a one-year extension to that short-term deal in the summer. Certainly brings vast top-flight experience to the Clarets, but the nagging question is how much chance he’ll get to bring that experience to bear on the actual pitch. Get the sense this is unofficially almost a player-coach role.",
      "",
      "67) Jay Matete (Sunderland)\nSpent last season on loan with Bolton in League One. Seems unlikely to now force his way into a bolstered Premier League-ready squad.",
      "",
      "66) Hannes Delcroix (Burnley)\nSpent the second half of last season on loan at Swansea and appears unlikely to add to his 12 Premier League appearances from 23/24.",
      "",
      "65) David Carmo (Nottingham Forest)\nWent out on loan to Olympiacos straight after signing for Forest last summer, and it’s important not to look at who owns Olympiacos. Appears to be available for another temporary move at least this summer.",
      "",
      "64) Joe Anderson (Sunderland)\nMade his first Sunderland start 811 days after signing during that fun and ultimately justified period late in the season when Regis Le Bris was resting all his key players for the play-offs. Unlikely to see how that translates to Premier League opportunities now.",
      "",
      "63) Etienne Green (Burnley)\nWe very much enjoy the fact the Anglo-French goalkeeper played for Saint-Etienne. And actually played, too, which hasn’t been the case since joining Burnley last summer. Presumably because his name is not Etienne Burnley.",
      "",
      "62) Emmanuel Dennis (Nottingham Forest)\nIn the last year – and realistically surely last days – of a Forest career that has just never got going after a £10m move in 2022. Less than 30 appearances later, there is zero chance he adds to that tally with Dennis likely available for free to anyone who wants him.",
      "",
      "61) Alfie Gilchrist (Chelsea)\nDoesn’t take a genius to work out that, with no permanent deal materialising, another Championship loan appears likely.",
      "",
      "60) Armando Broja (Burnley)\nShort of fitness after a disrupted pre-season, was Scott Parker’s explanation for his absence at Spurs. Fair enough, probably.",
      "",
      "59) Naouirou Ahamada (Crystal Palace)\nSpent last year on loan at Rennes, doesn’t appear to be in Oliver Glasner’s plans, and the transfer trail on this one has now gone extremely cold.",
      "",
      "58) Nathan Patterson (Everton)\nHas had a torrid time at Everton with injuries but had been involved during pre-season before being left out altogether at Leeds on Monday night.",
      "",
      "57) Sam Greenwood (Leeds)\nAttracted plenty of Championship interest early in the summer but it’s all gone a bit quiet for a player who spent last season on loan at Preston and is entering the final year of his Leeds contract.",
      "",
      "56) Josh Bowler (Nottingham Forest)\nHas had five loan moves in three years at Forest, most recently at Luton for the second half of last season, and appears to be further away from the first-team picture than ever.",
      "",
      "55) Issa Kabore (Man City)\nSpent last season out on loan at Benfica and Werder Bremen, and the right-back is powerfully unlikely to still be at City when the transfer window music stops.",
      "",
      "54) Callum Doyle (Man City)\nSet to be the latest high-profile member of the great Wrexham Circus.",
      "",
      "53) Omar Richards (Nottingham Forest)\nWas unlucky with injuries when he first signed for Forest from Bayern Munich, but any chance of making a go of things at the City Ground has now surely passed him by. Spent last season on loan with Rio Ave in Portugal, and a permanent return has been touted and seems a win all round.",
      "",
      "52) Harry Amass (Man United)\nWas even left out of the U21 side as United seek to secure a loan for a player they’ve been clear is not available for permanent transfer. There is interest from the Championship, but United appear in no rush to push Amass out the door.",
      "",
      "51) Luca Koleosho (Burnley)\nCould be heading back to his former club Espanyol on loan, according to the Burnley Express. Which is a newspaper and not James Anderson.",
      "",
      "50) Martial Godo (Fulham)\nCoventry are keen on the winger, who was a bit-part first-team player last season and appears unlikely at this stage to be any more than that for Marco Silva this time around.",
      "",
      "49) Alex Murphy (Newcastle)\nSpent the second half of last season on loan at Bolton and the start of this one back with Newcastle’s Under-21s.",
      "",
      "48) Eric da Silva Moreira (Nottingham Forest)\nBologna have been linked with the young full-back who made only two brief appearances in the Premier League last season but did make it as far as the bench for four of the first five games. But, perhaps tellingly, only once in the second half of the season.",
      "",
      "47) Alan Browne (Sunderland)\nFilled in in various positions during the promotion season, but among those seemingly now left behind by the squad’s Premier League glow-up.",
      "",
      "46) Aaron Anselmino (Chelsea)\nAccording to Matt Law, Chelsea ‘haven’t quite decided’ what they want to do with the Argentine, who they signed for £15.6m last summer, sent back to Boca Juniors on loan for the season, recalled in January, never picked, then took to the Club World Cup, where he played for two whole minutes. Our crystal ball says: season-long loan somewhere in La Liga.",
      "",
      "45) Milan Aleksic (Sunderland)\nAnother player whose chances last season came mainly towards the end of the regular Championship season when all eyes were firmly on the play-offs.",
      "",
      "44) Abdallah Sima (Brighton)\nVery much for sale, with a wonderfully varied crop of reported suitors including Norwich, Lens and Olympiacos, while Rangers – where he spent 23/24 on loan – have also been interested in another go.",
      "",
      "43) Ahmed Abdullahi (Sunderland)\nInjury wrecked his first season on Wearside and Regis Le Bris was apparently keen to at least give him a pre-season chance to show his worth. We’ll have a definitive verdict on that over the next week or so.",
      "",
      "42) Jeremy Sarmiento (Brighton)\nSeeking a permanent move away from Brighton over the next couple of weeks having spent the last two seasons as something of a Championship promotion specialist after spending time at both Ipswich and Burnley in their successful campaigns.",
      "",
      "41) Harrison Ashby (Newcastle)\nStill yet to make a competitive appearance for Newcastle since his move from West Ham, and at 23 can surely no longer rely on ‘promising youngster’ status. Make-or-break season, you feel. And a sub-optimal start.",
      "",
      "40) Nazariy Rusyn (Sunderland)\nHajduk Split opted not to trigger a permanent move after his loan last season.",
      "",
      "39) Fabio Vieira (Arsenal)\nDoes sadly now look like he will not go down as the greatest Vieira to play for the Gunners. A loan to Stuttgart has been mooted for a player further away from the first-team picture than ever after Arsenal’s extravagant summer purchases.",
      "",
      "38) Matt Targett (Newcastle)\nPlayed only 19 minutes of Premier League football last season but did at least generally make the bench when available.",
      "",
      "37) Maxwel Cornet (West Ham)\nThe most forgotten of forgotten men. Graham Potter has been very gentle but very clear. “He’s at a stage in his career where he needs to play regularly. At the moment, it’s difficult for me to guarantee that.”",
      "",
      "36) Tawanda Chirewa (Wolves)\nSpent last season on loan at Derby and Huddersfield. Something similar is likely on the cards for 25/26.",
      "",
      "35) David Datro Fofana (Chelsea)\nThe top question suggested when you Google him is ‘Who does David Datro Fofana play for?’ and that is an uncomfortably profound question.",
      "",
      "34) Nectarios Triantis (Sunderland)\nHibs have been keen to take him back after his time there on loan, while West Brom have also been strongly linked with the midfielder.",
      "",
      "33) Calvin Ramsay (Liverpool)\nLikely heading back to Scotland having failed to establish himself at Anfield. Which is no disgrace, to be fair.",
      "",
      "32) Fabio Silva (Wolves)\nNow apparently set for a move to Roma, because he is less fussy about these things than Jadon Sancho apparently.",
      "",
      "31) Igor (Brighton)\nWas expected to join Real Sociedad weeks ago. Has not yet done so. Might not do so. Either way, doesn’t appear to figure in Fabian Hurzeler’s Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "30) Isaac Schmidt (Leeds)\nA loan switch to Werder Bremen is all agreed, but Leeds want numbers in before letting the full-back leave.",
      "",
      "29) Karl Hein (Arsenal)\nHas made one Arsenal appearance in seven years – of course it was in the Carabao – and appears to be in the itchy-feet, want-to-play school of third-choice keepers rather than the can’t-believe-this-is-my-life-this-is-amazing group. Werder Bremen are apparently keen.",
      "",
      "28) Chido Obi (Man United)\nPatience is the key for a 17-year-old who made his breakthrough last season and will surely get opportunities again this time around, especially when/if Hojlund is bombed out.",
      "",
      "27) Owen Bevan (Bournemouth)\nHighly-rated Wales U21 centre-back has seen injuries hamper his progression to the first team, whether that’s at Bournemouth themselves or somewhere else on loan. If he stays fit, could yet get a chance this season given the way pretty much Bournemouth’s entire defence was picked off in the summer.",
      "",
      "26) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea)\nWe’re calling it now: deadline-day loan to Spurs after both he and they have exhausted all other options.",
      "",
      "25) Pedro Lima (Wolves)\nA loan looks like a smart idea for the right-back, who is one of approximately 7398 fringe Premier League players apparently of interest to Wrexham.",
      "",
      "24) Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\nThe club activated a contract extension last season, but with Lascelles having now apparently slipped to, at best, fifth-choice centre-back it wouldn’t be a huge shock to see Newcastle’s longest-serving current player moved on over the next 10 days.",
      "",
      "23) Reiss Nelson (Arsenal)\nArsenal would like to sell him, Fulham would like to have him back. Should be simple, but the Cottagers favour another loan for an injury-prone player entering the final two years of his contract while Arsenal would prefer something more permanent. It screams loan-with-option on September 1, frankly.",
      "",
      "22) Mike Tresor (Burnley)\nRestricted to one substitute appearance in the FA Cup across the whole of last season. It’s just never quite happened for the winger at Turf Moor and having been prominently involved in pre-season was nowhere to be seen in the matchday squad at Tottenham, suggesting a departure over the next couple of weeks is surely the likely outcome here.",
      "",
      "21) Ethan Pinnock (Brentford)\nHas seen it all across six years at Brentford and you’d imagine he remains a welcome familiar sight after a summer of upheaval and flux for the Bees. Played 32 matches in Brentford’s first Premier League season, then 30, 29 and 22 in the subsequent three. No great surprise to see those numbers continue on that trend this season, but he was still on the bench for every game he was available last term.",
      "",
      "20) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nCurrently sat with his trotters up on close to 200 grand a week. You can only be so miffed about that. Chelsea’s transfer policy is not his fault, and he’s another one whose wildly generous contract terms make him extremely awkward to shift no matter how surplus to requirements he becomes.",
      "",
      "19) Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nDoes appear among the more shiftable of the 25/26 Chelsea bomb squad. Spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and there must surely be a Premier League suitor out there that works for all parties. Also not one of the Chelsea outcasts on the very daftest money, putting him within the wage structure of most non-crazy Premier League clubs. Most obviously and necessarily Bournemouth given the scale of their defensive losses this summer.",
      "",
      "18) Albert Sambi Lokonga (Arsenal)\nSevilla didn’t take up the option to make his loan permanent at the end of last season, so Lokonga is back in career limbo. They’re not Man United-level, but Arsenal are low-key bad at getting fringe players out the door.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho (Man United)\nChelsea or nothing has been Garnacho’s mantra all summer. Could actually end up being nothing. Can Chelsea get Prick Protection?",
      "",
      "16) Illan Meslier (Leeds)\nHigh-profile errors last season didn’t cost Leeds in the end, but have cost Meslier. Firmly replaced as first choice by Lucas Perri and not even on the bench against Everton. A return to France seems the likeliest outcome here.",
      "",
      "15) Jadon Sancho (Man United)\nEverything appears to be agreed with Roma for a loan-with-obligation, and we’re not quite sure what Sancho is waiting for as his ill-fated United career meanders to an acrimonious close. We should all be hacked off at this waste of an obvious talent, but not sure where exactly Sancho can reasonably now direct his own ire without asking himself uncomfortable questions.",
      "",
      "14) Konstantinos Tsimikas (Liverpool)\nNow behind Milos Kerkez as well as Andy Robertson in the left-back pecking order at Anfield, with Fulham, Leeds and Nottingham Forest all keen to offer him a more straightforward route to Premier League minutes, but he could yet be retained at Liverpool for squad depth purposes.",
      "",
      "13) Tyrell Malacia (Man United)\nPart of the bloated United Bomb Squad, but not perhaps a villain in the same way as certain other members of that cohort. Malacia’s crime, such as it is, is to be not quite good enough. He also wasn’t quite good enough for PSV, where he spent the second half of last season on loan.",
      "",
      "12) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nHas made over 100 Premier League appearances for the Seagulls and signed a one-year contract extension in the summer, but could yet move on before the window closes. Everton have been sniffing around, by all accounts.",
      "",
      "11) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nLooks certain to join the Brighton exodus; the only question is where, for how long, and/or for how much. The list of clubs reportedly interested is a long and glamorous one with Spurs, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Roma and also, in fairness, Leeds, West Ham and Forest all credited with interest of some sort or other in the Argentine playmaker this summer.",
      "",
      "10) Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea)\nChelsea are holding out for a permanent sale, and want somewhere close to the £40m release clause in his contract. Borussia Dortmund wanted another loan move, and now Juventus are reportedly interested having allowed Douglas Luiz to join Nottingham Forest on loan.",
      "",

      "Manchester United reportedly asked for an evolving Chelsea star in negotiations over the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to the London club.",
      "United have attempted to shift some players off the books who are surplus to requirements this summer. They got Marcus Rashford out on loan, to Barcelona, but the likes of Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are still at the club.",
      "Should they sell each of those players, they should make a decent sum of money, to potentially but some new talent.",
      "They have also been looking into a midfield signing since improving their attack, but the lack of available funds has hindered their pursuit of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, while Crystal Palace don’t want to sell Adam Wharton.",
      "But United have looked for a solution which solves both of their problems. They have been negotiating with Chelsea for some time over the potential sale of Garnacho.",
      "The Red Devils want £50million, while their Premier League rivals don’t want to pay more than £30million.",
      "But to potentially bring the price down and add a midfield star to their ranks, transfer insider Ben Jacobs has suggested that United asked for Andrey Santos.",
      "He said on The United Stand: “What I can tell you is that when discussions have been ongoing for Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, Andrey Santos has been spoken about.",
      "“I don’t think it’s going to lead anywhere, because Chelsea don’t want to sell. That’s another player, though, that Manchester United appreciate. It’s nothing more than that at this stage.”",
      "It is unsurprising that Chelsea don’t want to lose Santos. After going out on loan to Strasbourg last season, where he scored 10 Ligue 1 goals and assisted four more, he played four times in the Club World Cup for the Blues in the summer, assisting once, and came off the bench in this season’s Premier League opener.",
      "Reports earlier in the summer suggested that West Ham had approached Chelsea over the potential £45million transfer of Santos, but were turned away as Enzo Maresca’s side see a lot of promise in the Brazilian midfielder.",
      "That will leave United sweating that they’ll have to let Garnacho go to Stamford Bridge for a cut-price fee, as Ruben Amorim doesn’t want him, needs cash, and currently Chelsea are the only side who are in for him, but won’t budge.",
      "A recent report has stated the Red Devils have given Tottenham the green light to make an approach for Garnacho, as drumming up some extra interest might mean the winger’s price rises and Chelsea don’t get an easy deal.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working to finalise the signing’ of Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho amid a ‘discreet offer’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed his clear “feeling” on Alejandro Garnacho’s situation at Manchester United amid interest from Chelsea.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly made a ‘whopping offer’ for a defender, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons.",

      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "That is also true of Carlos Baleba, who has had two good seasons in English football, but United are seemingly aware the signing of the £100million-plus-rated midfielder is not plausible right now.",
      "As such, our friends at TEAMtalk report the Red Devils have picked out a different ‘dream target,’ also from within the Premier League.",
      "United have long been known to be admirers of Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, and it’s said they dream of bringing him to Old Trafford.",

To be honest, it’s why Man Utd looked dangerous in certain spells on Sunday. When you have players like Bruno, Cunha and Mbuemo, you have players who can come up with moments from nothing. These players transcend coaching and tactics. You just tell them to go out there and do what they do.",

But of course we also know that United have played well against the big teams last season as well so United’s games against Fulham and Burney will ironically tell us whether Arsenal should be lauded for winning ugly or considered just lucky.

      "🔴 Mbeumo's running power🔄 O'Riley to replace Joao Pedro? 🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United face Fulham on Super Sunday hoping to build on the positives from their narrow loss to Arsenal. Bryan Mbeumo's performance was one of them. His debut, following a strong pre-season, underlined his potential to transform their attack.",
      "It could be seen in his very first actions of the game.",
      "Inside the opening minute, Mbeumo controlled a looping clearance in his own half then drove Manchester United deep into Arsenal territory on the break. Soon afterwards, he was latching onto a Bruno Fernandes through-ball and testing David Raya.",
      "Manchester United ended up dominating possession against one of the Premier League's top teams for the first time in a decade. It was when attacking quickly and directly, though, that they looked most dangerous. Matheus Cunha helped but Mbeumo was key.",
      "Last season, Manchester United directed a far higher percentage of attacks down the left than the right but the emphasis switched completely against Arsenal as they looked for Mbeumo at every opportunity. The former Brentford winger is their outlet now.",
      "He finished the game having had more shots than any other player. He ranked top for touches in the opposition box and dribbles too. But it is his movement that makes it all possible.",
      "Mbeumo made more attacking runs than anyone else in the division at Brentford last season and he occupied the same spot in the rankings on the opening weekend of the new campaign.",
      "The 26-year-old has given Manchester United a new level of running power. His total of 30 attacking runs in his very first appearance for the club was only bettered by Manchester United players on five occasions in the whole of last season in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim has said since his appointment last year that he wants his side to have more possession and thereby more control. But increasing their threat on the counter and on transitions is also seen as crucial. It is already clear that Mbeumo makes it possible.",
      "Against Arsenal, Manchester United totalled four direct attacks and three fast breaks, a combined total beaten only by Liverpool and Bournemouth on the opening weekend and a significant increase on the side's averages under Amorim last season.",
      "The trouble, of course, was that they were unable to make them count. The next challenge is to find a ruthless edge, starting at Craven Cottage. But Mbeumo's impact is evident, even after one game. Manchester United have glimpsed what they can become.",
      "Matt O'Riley assumed penalty-taking duties for Brighton against Fulham last weekend following Joao Pedro's departure to Chelsea. Playing in the No 10 role vacated by the Brazilian, he offered a similar level of off-the-ball industry too.",
      "His total of 66 pressures in the 1-1 draw with Marco Silva's side was the eighth-highest among Premier League players on the opening weekend. Crucially, O'Riley offered quality as well as quantity. No player made more pressures leading to turnovers. His industry helped create opportunities for Brighton to hurt Fulham.",
      "Fabio Hurzeler praised his all-round contribution afterwards. \"He is doing a lot of work out of possession, so we are not only happy to have him because of the goal,\" he said. The Brighton boss will hope for more of the same from him against Everton on Super Sunday.",
      "Injuries made it difficult for O'Riley to showcase those physical qualities anything like as much as he would have liked in his first season at Brighton following his £25m arrival from Celtic last year. He was limited to only 11 starts in the Premier League.",
      "But despite interest from Italian clubs Napoli, Atalanta and Roma this summer, the early evidence this season suggests the club would be wise to keep hold of him as they adapt to life without his former team-mate, off the ball as well as on it.",
      "Nottingham Forest have lost Anthony Elanga but they have gained Dan Ndoye. The 24-year-old marked his debut with a goal against Brentford and could cause Crystal Palace problems next.",
      "The opening column of the season featured analysis of Martin Zubimendi's Arsenal role, Matheus Cunha's potential to help Patrick Dorgu thrive, and Ismaila Sarr's value to Crystal Palace.",

      "Thursday 21 August 2025 21:43, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Chelsea will turn the heat up on West Ham boss Graham Potter on Friday Night Football.",
      "If you take the relegated teams out of the equation, West Ham rank bottom in the Premier League per 90 for expected goals, shots, shots on target, chances created from open play and passes played into the box since Graham Potter took charge.",
      "There's a clear problem with converting their possession and territorial advantage into quality chance creation and scoring goals - not the first time we've said that about a Potter team.",
      "It can be possession for the sake of possession. The structure is there, but the soul isn't. It's just not very West Ham. The locals want a team that plays with grit and conviction. It could just be that Potter is a bit too spreadsheety for the Hammers. And things could become worse in the short term.",
      "Chelsea played just fine last weekend against Palace and had the most possession (72 per cent) and made the most passes (568) of all Premier League teams but failed to score from an expected goals tally of 1.7.",
      "They won't leave these points out there. Chelsea to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/4 with Sky Bet stands out.",
      "Here's a sentence that would have made absolutely zero sense this time last year: Tottenham are becoming a serious set-piece threat.",
      "Under Ange Postecoglou it was all vibes and vertical football, but under Thomas Frank there's good reason to believe Spurs could evolve into a set-piece machine. Brentford ranked second for expected goals from such situations last season in the Premier League and the early signs are positive for Spurs' ability to create havoc in the same vein.",
      "Hello, Micky van de Ven.",
      "He's not just a Rolls Royce in open play and with the ball - his power, pace, and timing make him an aerial asset waiting to be unlocked from attacking corners and free-kicks. In two starts under Frank, he's already amassed three shots and a goal against PSG.",
      "He is 6/4 with Sky Bet to register at least one shot and while the markets remain sleeping on the true probability, he is a great bet to attack.",
      "If you wanted some evidence about how much Brentford have potentially fallen in the summer, analysing their win price in the last meeting between these two clubs in March says a lot. The Bees, with Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Yoane Wissa in tow, were 11/10 shots to beat Aston Villa at home.",
      "They are priced up as 21/10 here just five months later, which indicates almost a five per cent implied probability shift.",
      "That's massive when assessing outright prices.",
      "They were utterly hopeless in the first half of their 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest. First day nerves to blame? Or more a deeper underlying issue that this is a bigger rebuilding job than the club first imagined? I'm in the latter camp.",
      "Sometimes in football betting, you just have to go back to basics.",
      "Squad downgrade? Check. Squad imbalance? Check. Dangerous opponents who have one of the best managers in Europe? Check.",
      "All signs point to a Bournemouth win over Wolves this weekend at 4/5 with Sky Bet - and this could be a bleak season for Vítor Pereira's men.",
      "At home, with the crowd behind them and Wolves trying to implement Pereira's possession-based patterns under pressure, this game sets up nicely for Andoni Iraola's side and the fast and frenetic Bournemouth style. The Cherries may just squeeze Wolves into errors and feast on transitions. They may have lost a lot of quality in their dressing room but the most important man remains: Iraola - as shown by their performance at Anfield.",
      "That's why they can be trusted to go again despite the squad overhaul.",
      "The Premier League has become a league where pace, power, directness and ability to have real physicality off the ball is so key. This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "I think Sunderland have noticed this trend and spent all summer planning to join the fast-break party because their recruitment has centred around bringing in big strong boys who either have lots of physical presence or carry great pace and power. They were so good on the break in the 3-0 win over West Ham. It was all about energy and progressive running.",
      "Habib Diarra was the real star - this kid is powerful and full of direct running forward. Regis Le Bris gave him lots of license to support the front man and he fired in two shots, one of which was defined a big chance. He's 6/5 with Sky Bet to hit two or more shots again in a game Sunderland will be targeting three points from.",
      "Beware: Declan Rice is a player I'll be rabbiting on about a lot this season.",
      "Since moving to Arsenal, Rice has evolved into more than just a midfield shield. Under Mikel Arteta, he's given license to step into advanced pockets, recycle possession and let fly when space opens up. This positional change makes him a fantastic betting prospect in the attacking props markets.",
      "Rice has covered his two or more shots line in his last six starts and boats an overall shots figure of 2.15 when playing in the No 8 role in 2025.",
      "That figure should be capable of being hit against against a newly-promoted team, where Arsenal will dominate territory and Rice finds himself with time to test the 'keeper or pepper the goal. Combining Arsenal to win and Rice to have two or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet looks a nice angle to attack.",
      "My first port of call whenever a key player leaves or suffers a serious injury is the with and without data to try and quantify how much a team will miss that player's output. Well, since the start of the 23/24 season, Eberechi Eze - on his way to Arsenal - hasn't started 21 games in the Premier League and in that time Palace's win percentage goes from 40 per cent to 19 per cent and their points per game drops from 1.5 to just 1.0 per game.",
      "Oliver Glasner has a difficult job in keeping confidence and mentality levels high within his squad after losing such an important and well-liked player.",
      "Forest are a trustworthy team as you know exactly what you're going to get in that they're very good in both boxes, and are led impeccably by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo in defence - one of the best defensive pairings in Europe.",
      "This looks a great time to head to Selhurst Park and the away win at 21/10 with Sky Bet does appeal.",
      "One lazy narrative that has stuck out during the pre-season chat is how Everton could struggle without the fortress of Goodison Park and may suffer from new stadium nerves. However, the last five teams in the top two tiers of English football that have moved stadiums possess a healthy record across their first five games.",
      "From those 25 games, they won 16 of them, losing just four.",
      "Hill Dickinson Stadium has been strategically built to keep the atmosphere hot and hostile and when Everton fans turn up the noise, they remain one of the most passionate set of fans in the country. Brighton are a team overrated by the markets in my view and the 19/10 with Sky Bet on Everton starting with a win at their new home looks a solid wager.",
      "The market likes what it saw from Manchester United against Arsenal based on their win price here. They are 21/20 with Sky Bet although it doesn't feel like particularly smart money is driving the United price into what it is. They still looked very timid in central midfield without the ball and doubts remain about whether the wing-backs - a key cog in any 3-5-2 system - provide enough attacking output to turn United into a functional and exciting team.",
      "I like backing Fulham when they are overlooked. Marco Silva's men are mostly ignored by the market but they took 30 of their 54 points last season against top-half teams. That's a huge return and one that made them very profitable to back as outsiders when the price was right. You can get 6/4 with Sky Bet here on Fulham on the draw no bet market meaning stakes are refunded if the game ends level.",
      "Eddie Howe is doing a great job at using the Alexander Isak situation to bring the club together as best he can.",
      "When St James' Park smells disrespect, it bites back. You can expect the atmosphere to be a bearpit on Monday. Every Liverpool touch booed. Newcastle players pumped to play aggressively from the first whistle as they look to utilise that hotbed of noise to their advantage.",
      "And that's when the Toon are at their most dangerous.",
      "Despite the win vs Bournemouth, Liverpool appeared more vulnerable on the break than last season as they faced more fast breaks (5) in that game than in any Premier League game at Anfield last season.",
      "And Newcastle are built to counter-attack with a front three of Anthony Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes perfectly equipped to hit Liverpool in transition. The hosts look a great bet in the double chance market at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",

      "He needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.",
      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",

      "The IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\n\n\n\"If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.\"",
      "You don't see it often. Most free kicks don't result in a goal, and because this one does, VAR has to check it.",
      "It was all about Caicedo moving into the wall and Guehi being in contact with him.",
      "The genie is out the bottle now.",
      "Micah Richards said: \"There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.\"",
      "Roy Keane added: \"Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.",
      "\"Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Senesi avoids punishment after appearing to handle the ball as the last defender.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: I think this is a really interesting situation. The VAR, for me, has looked at it too quickly and cleared it.",
      "I think he's seen the ball fly up off Senesi and has not watched the second part.",
      "He's seen the ball hit the elbow off the knee and stopped looking, he hasn't looked for the second swipe. If he sends the referee to the screen, the referee has all options. He probably sends Senesi off because Huge Ekitike is going to be away. The only doubt is, is it too far from goal? But this is a class forward.",
      "If it goes to the screen he would have been sent off. It was a mistake and fortunately it didn't affect the outcome of the game.",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher on how referee Anthony Taylor deal with the incident involving Antoine Semenyo at Anfield:\n\n\n\"Firstly, it's terrible what happened.\n\n\n\"However, from the referee's point of view, absolutely first class.\n\n\nWhat I really liked was he got both managers together really quickly and explained what had happened.\n\n\n\"They identified where it came from and it was dealt with really quickly.\n\n\n\"The referee was first class because he kept everyone aware of what he was doing. he made it very apparent that protocol was followed and the fourth official was noting everything down.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Burnley goalkeeper Dubravka gets penalised for holding the ball for more than eight seconds, resulting in an opposition corner.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: If you watch, he does take too long. I get a bit concerned with the eight seconds, because we don't want to have to get the stop watch out. But he's making no attempt to release the ball.",
      "It's a deterrent. That's why the rule is there. No referee wants to have to apply that rule, they want goalkeepers to get rid of the ball and keep the game moving faster.",
      "\"I don't know why he's holding onto the ball for so long, it's about 12 seconds.\"",

      "Liverpool, Arsenal and Man City are tipped for a tight Premier League title race but what Ruben Amorim can achieve with Man Utd divided the pundits, while Erling Haaland and Florian Wirtz were among the players picked to shine as Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville made their predictions...",
      "By Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville",
      "Tuesday 19 August 2025 18:34, UK",
      "Speaking on Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville made their 2025/26 Premier League season predictions.",
      "Gary Neville - Arsenal (but it's too close to call)",
      "I couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool. I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it.",
      "Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.",
      "Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "City have an unbelievable spine.",
      "I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.",
      "Jamie Carragher - Liverpool, ahead of Man City",
      "What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",
      "Neville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves",
      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",
      "Carragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "It's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.",
      "Neville - Adrien Truffert",
      "I was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.",
      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.",
      "Carragher - Oliver Glasner",
      "I think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.",

      "\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home.",
      "\"We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.",

      "Arsenal clinched a 1-0 win over Man Utd at Old Trafford thanks to Riccardo Calafiori's goal from a corner but the performance also highlighted the key areas for improvement this season; Viktor Gyokeres struggled to make an impact on his debut",
      "Sunday 17 August 2025 21:07, UK",
      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",
