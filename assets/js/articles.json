      "Bryan Mbeumo has been told it is a no-brainer choosing a move to Manchester United over Tottenham.",
      "United have already failed with a £55million bid for Mbeumo, with Spurs hopeful the appointment of Thomas Frank as boss can help convince the striker to make the same switch from Brentford.",
      "The two Premier League clubs are fighting it out for Mbeumo, but former United winger Lee Sharpe said he must choose the Red Devils over Spurs – despite the lack of European football.",
      "United lost the Europa League final 1-0 to Spurs last month, meaning Old Trafford will not play host to European football for only the second time in 35 years.",
      "Despite that, Sharpe has told 26-year-old Mbeumo he must choose United, despite the fact he will be turning his back on the Champions League and the chance to link up with his former boss.",
      "“It will be a really tough decision for Mbeumo,” Sharpe told Aceodds.com. “To go to Tottenham, playing in the Champions League with the manager you have been playing under and trusts you, knows your game and personality which makes the transition a lot easier.",
      "“But there's only one Manchester United and the opportunity to play for United doesn’t come along many times in your career - maybe even not at all.",
      "“I understand that Tottenham are playing in Europe, and might seem like a better option to him, with a manager he knows. But I think that if he can be a part of this rebuild and do well, he will never look back.”",
      "Sharpe, who spent eight years at United, making 263 appearances and scoring 36 goals, also questioned whether Jadon Sancho is good enough to play in the Premier League.",
      "United winger Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea and is facing an uncertain future, with the London club having paid the Red Devils a £5m fee not to make the move permanent.",
      "Against that backdrop, Sharpe questioned whether Sancho is cut out for the Premier League and suggested a move back to Germany – where he played for Borussia Dortmund – may better suit him.",
      "“It’s been a shame with Sancho, because he’s one of the players I would pay an entrance fee to go and watch,” said Sharpe. “His footwork and ability to take people on is great.",
      "“As a kid, I would have wanted his name in the back of my shirt. I want to watch him dribble and beat players. On his day he’s awesome.",
      "“He just doesn't seem to be able to do in the Premier League and the pace the league is at. I think he's quick enough, but I don’t know if likes dealing with the physicality. He can go past people like they're not even there and at times he just seems to take the easy option and pass it square.",
      "“With his ability, he should be taking players on at every opportunity and I don’t think he does it enough. He’s unbelievably talented but doesn’t do it enough. Maybe Germany suits him more, where teams don’t sit in as much and he has more time and space to beat players.”",
      "Lee Sharpe was speaking to Aceodds. The full interview can be found here Aceodds.com",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are among four misfits set to be axed from Manchester United’s pre-season tour. The Red Devils are set to travel to the US in July for a clutch of lucrative matches as part of their preparations for the new campaign.",
      "They will take on Premier League rivals West Ham United, Bournemouth and Everton as part of that tour. But Ruben Amorim is set to take a brutal approach to his squad with many stars expected to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "According to The Sun, four out-of-favour stars are set to be left behind at Carrington for the tour should they fail to seal moves away from United before then. That includes academy graduate Rashford after Aston Villa turned down the chance to sign him permanently following his loan spell.",
      "The forward has since been linked with Barcelona. He is set to be joined by Jadon Sancho after he too saw a permanent move to Chelsea collapse following a loan spell last season.",
      "Napoli have since emerged for his services but are struggling to afford his wages as it stands. Alejandro Garnacho also faces little prospect of a future at United - the Argentine having also been linked with Napoli.",
      "The final player that Amorim wants to leave behind is Antony. The Brazilian winger has struggled since his big-money move from Ajax and while he impressed with Real Betis last term, the Spanish side are yet to make a renewed move.",
      "Explaining Amorim’s hardline stance, a source quoted by The Sun said: “Amorim is stamping his authority on the club. It was hard arriving mid-season but he now has the opportunity to shape the team in his image. And he’s wasting no time.",
      "“He only wants players who would die for the shirt and are on board with his ideas. He also wants a smaller squad to create an intimate team bond so that everyone gets enough game time to be at peak fitness when called upon. He doesn’t want any bad apples or distractions.”",
      "While Amorim is set to axe a few faces from his squad for United’s pre-season commitments, there could also be a few new additions to the squad. Matheus Cunha is due to join up with the Red Devils following his £62.5m move from Wolves.",
      "He could yet be joined by Bryan Mbeumo, who remains at the heart of a tug of war between United and Tottenham. As it stands, he favours a move to Old Trafford but United chiefs are yet to agree terms with the Bees over the Cameroon forward.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Brentford have sent Manchester United fans into a Bryan Mbeumo-themed transfer frenzy with some naughty social media hijinx. The Cameroon forward is of interest to both Manchester United and Tottenham this season following a sensational season last time out.",
      "He is thought to favour a move to Old Trafford but a reunion with his former Brentford boss Thomas Frank is on the cards in North London. And while his future is yet to be fully decided, the Bees social media team have allowed themselves to have a bit of fun.",
      "They shared a two-minute long video on Twitter on Thursday afternoon showing every Premier League goal that Mbeumo had scored last season. Of course, the 26-year-old enjoyed a stunning campaign as he plundered 20 goals for the Bees - something that has likely triggered interest in his services.",
      "Some Red Devils fans even suggested that a transfer could be imminent after watching the video. One fan said: “Farewell comp?” While another added: “Time to let him go, gents.” A final fan replied: \"We will love to see this at Old Trafford.\"",
      "Mbeumo has already broken his silence on his future having admitted he was slightly unprepared for the furore around a transfer, albeit was taking it in his stride. He said: \"It (transfer speculation) is a bit new for me I would say! I think it can be the life of a footballer, and you need to accept it.",
      "\"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League. And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "One man who needs no reminder of Mbeumo’s abilities will surely be former Brentford boss Frank. Speaking during his time in West London, he warned any interested sides that they would have to dig deep into their pockets to afford him - words that could now come back to bite him having moved to Spurs.",
      "\"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" Frank said. \"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot.",
      "\"Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for.",
      "\"I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don’t look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "“How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\"",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has reportedly decided to reject a lucrative contract offer from Juventus, with the striker preferring a move to Arsenal. Gyokeres is one of the most in-demand footballers in Europe right now, having fired Sporting Lisbon to the double last season.",
      "The 27-year-old scored 54 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions as Sporting won the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal. Arsenal, Manchester United and Juventus have all been heavily linked with Gyokeres, but it appears the player has his heart set on a move to the Emirates.",
      "It emerged earlier this month that Juventus were ready to offer Gyokeres a stunning £11m-per-year deal to try and persuade him to snub a Premier League move in favour of a switch to Serie A.",
      "However, Corriere dello Sport are now reporting that Juventus have been informed that Gyokeres only wants to join Arsenal this summer. The news comes amid a public spat between Gyokeres' agent and Sporting over a supposed 'gentleman's agreement'.",
      "Gyokeres has an £85million release clause, but his agent has claimed he reached an agreement with the club last season that they would accept bids in the region of £60m. However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has insisted that is not the case.",
      "\"One thing you should already know is me better,\" said Varandas, per Record. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me. I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",
      "\"This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyokeres, neither today nor last season. I think it's fair to explain the whole process.",
      "\"The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season. During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him.",
      "\"When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.",
      "\"Viana manages the relationship with the agents, and very well, this is done by the sporting director. One of the agent's biggest concerns was whether we would demand the value of the €100m (£85m) clause next year.",
      "\"Viana negotiated with the agents over several meetings, until the agent himself asked for the president's presence to settle the matter once and for all. The issue of the bonus for 'x' goals seemed reasonable and at that meeting, where the president, the agent and Viana were present, no player was present, Viktor was not present, the agent wanted to guarantee certain things.\"",

While his numbers haven't been great this season, Moyes loves hard workers and that's something you can never complain about in regards to Hojlund.",
      "\"It's not very often David Moyes has had a 20-30 goals-per-season striker. He’s had strikers who run in behind and create space to bring others into play, so, if he's available, Hojlund could be a tempting option for Everton to sign on loan.\"",

He gives 100% and shows great commitment, but we haven’t seen him really improve as a player.",
      "“The mentality is there on the pitch but he hasn’t been improving step by step. Chelsea already have wingers in similar situations with the same frustrations. Signing Garnacho is not a good idea.”",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is confident he will sign a new contract with Paris Saint-Germain as he confirmed his agent remains locked in talks with the French champions. Donnarumma arrived at the Parc des Princes in 2021.",
      "He has enjoyed a highly-successful spell in the French capital since then, winning 10 major trophies. The Italian was a key member of the team which won the treble this season, storming to the Ligue 1 title, beating Reims in the Coupe de France final and smashing Inter Milan in the Champions League final.",
      "Despite his importance to Luis Enrique's side and his standing as one of the world's top keepers, the 26-year-old's contract is set to expire next summer. That has led to growing uncertainty over his future in the French capital.",

      "The chance to sign Donnarumma would be too good to turn down for United. The Italian was player of the tournament as his country won Euro 2020, just before his move to PSG.",
      "According L'Equipe, he keeper has already had private talks with his international team-mates about a potential move to the Premier League. But earlier this month, Donnarumma made it clear he wanted to remain in Paris."

      "Sporting CP striker Conrad Harder has offered his thoughts on fellow frontman Viktor Gyokeres’ ongoing transfer saga. Gyokeres, 27, has attracted plenty of attention following his prolific two-year spell in Portugal.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United are each interested in the ex-Coventry City star, who has scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting. And Gyokeres’ future has taken another recent twist after he reportedly rejected the chance to have clear-the-air talks with Sporting. It is claimed that the tension initially stemmed from the club demanding a higher fee than expected after promising to sell him this summer.",
      "It remains to be seen where Gyokeres will be playing his football next season, as Arsenal have also had their attention on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, while United is not seen to be the preferred option for Gyokeres, despite Old Trafford being where his former manager at Sporting, Ruben Amorim, now resides.",
      "However, despite the transfer drama surrounding Gyokeres, it clearly does not concern his Sporting team-mate Harder, who is in fact relishing the chance to take his place next term.",
      "\"Gyokeres? I'm not interested in any news,” Harder told Sport TV, as per Portuguese outlet A Bola. “I am focusing on myself. I want to play. We'll see what happens.",
      "“It's important for me to have minutes now. I was on the bench for a year, and I need to play. I think I'm ready, and we'll see. It will be good to have minutes.",
      "“We will never forget what Viktor did at Sporting. Never! But I hope that the team and I can live up to the challenge. I'll do my best. I think I'm ready.",
      "“I'm not ready to be the new Viktor; he's 27 years old, I'm 20... But I'm prepared to do what I'm best at. And we'll see what I can bring to the team. I want to stay at Sporting.”",
      "Harder spoke after scoring a brace for Denmark in their draw with Finland at the Under-21 Euros on Wednesday. The young forward will hope to keep his place for Denmark’s quarter-final clash with France as he also seeks to prove he can fill the potential void left by Gyokeres at Sporting.",
      "\"I can use this tournament to gain some form. I haven't played that much in the last four or five months, so having game minutes is incredible,” Harder explained. “I think I've already proven to many people that I'm ready to play, but I want to prove a little more that I'm ready to play.”",
      "Harder was forced to be back-up to Gyokeres after arriving from Nordsjaelland last summer, but he made the most of his limited time on the pitch. He ended the season with 13 goals and 10 assists in all competitions, despite only making 21 starts, as Sporting won the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres, who is currently on holiday in Saint Tropez, recently dismissed the noise around his future. Posting on his Instagram story, the striker wrote: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has spoken openly about Gyokeres’ situation. Varandas defended the club’s position and explained that Sporting are yet to receive an offer for their talisman.",
      "“One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me,” Varandas said, as per Portuguese outlet Record. \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",
      "“This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season. During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him.",
      "\"When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.\"",

      "Viktor Gyokeres' agent does not have a ‘signed letter’ from Sporting CP allowing him to leave for a fee less than his release clause, reports in Portugal claim. Gyokeres’ sensational form over the past two seasons has seen Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United both heavily linked with the Swede this summer.",
      "And it has emerged that Gyokeres prefers a move to north London under Mikel Arteta over being reunited with his former boss, Ruben Amorim, at Old Trafford.",
      "But it appears his dream move to Arsenal has hit a stumbling block due to the fee demanded by the Portuguese champions being too high. Reports had stated that the 27-year-old striker would be allowed to leave Sporting for a fee below his £84m release clause.",
      "His agent, Hassan Cetinkaya, claimed he reached a gentleman’s agreement with the club last summer which meant they would accept any offer in the region of £60m (€70m consisting of €60m plus €10m in bonuses), even saying that he had a signed letter to prove it.",
      "However, Sporting’s club president Frederico Varandas has accused Gyokeres' team of trying to 'blackmail' the Portuguese giants into allowing their talisman to leave. The club are therefore holding out for a significantly higher fee which has stalled his potential exit.",
      "And on Wednesday, during a conversation between Luís Aguilar, Marco Caneira and Pedro Henriques on the Jogo Aberto podcast, it was claimed that there was indeed no written document signed by Sporting bosses that obliges the club to accept a lower offer.",
      "Former Sporting defender Caneira said: “Sporting are calm, the agent’s main problem is the contract he has with the player, which is coming to an end.”",
      "Co-host and former Benfica star Henriques added: “Gyokeres’ agent’s strategy only creates chaos and discomfort.”",
      "Meanwhile, Portuguese publication A Bola reports that Cetinkaya’s bold claim actually refers to a clause that allows him to receive 10% of any external offer over £51.3m (€60m), which Sporting rejects.",
      "It also states that the clause isn’t in letter form but in the contract the Sweden international signed in the summer of 2023, following his move from Coventry City.",
      "If that clause is triggered, Sporting will then demand the full £84m release clause in order to let him go – something that is unlikely to sit well with the forward.",
      "Gyokeres has reportedly already threatened to go on strike after vowing to 'speak at the right time.'",
      "According to A Bola, he is 'very upset' with Sporting's current stance and has made his feelings clear to the club's hierarchy.",
      "Arsenal have not put all their eggs in one basket, as a result of the issues surrounding Gyokeres' exit from Sporting. Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig is also being hunted, and the Gunners are looking to see which deal will offer the best value for money.",
      "United, meanwhile, have so far struggled to follow up their signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, as Tottenham's interest in Bryan Mbuemo has seen that move stall.",

      "Marcus Rashford's future at Manchester United remains uncertain for 2025/26 as the summer transfer window reopens. The forward fell out of favour in the Red Devils starting XI when Ruben Amorim arrived at Old Trafford in November after the dismissal of Erik ten Hag.",
      "And as a result, he was sent out on loan to Aston Villa for the second half of the season, writing on Instagram at the time: \"I would like to thank Manchester United and Aston Villa for making this loan deal happen. I was lucky to have a few clubs approach me but Aston Villa was an easy decision - I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions.",
      "\"I just want to play football and am excited to get started. I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best for the rest of the season.\"",
      "While Rashford impressed at Villa Park under the tutelage of Unai Emery - scoring four goals and providing six assists in 17 games - it seems unlikely at present that the club will exercise their £40million option to buy him permanently. As a result, Rashford is set to return to Old Trafford, although it is unlikely that he will work his way back into the team under Amorim.",
      "As he is under contract until 2028, the price will ultimately have to be right for Rashford to be given permission to leave the Red Devils. With an interesting summer transfer window in full effect, here's the latest on Rashford's situation - including all of the teams that he has been linked with a move to ahead of 2025/26...",
      "While Villa hold a £40m option to buy Rashford after his loan spell, they do not hold first refusal on him should another club come and match that offer. Meanwhile, with Rashford looking to find his way back into the England squad under Thomas Tuchel, he will hope to play Champions League football in 2025/26 - something he will not be able to do with the Villains, and as a result, he may choose to give other elite clubs priority.",
      "Meanwhile at the end of the season, Rashford took to Instagram to write a heart-felt message which came across as more of a farewell than an 'I'll see you again soon.' He wrote: \"Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me.",
      "\"It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from 1st minute on the pitch. Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",
      "While it has been reported that Rashford is currently holding out hope for a move to Barcelona, the likelihood of a transfer coming to fruition seems to be getting slimmer by the day. The English international has already reportedly announced that he's willing to take a pay cut from his current £350,000-per-week deal to play for the Catalan giants, however, it appears as though Barca have had their heads turned by other players elsewhere.",
      "It is understood that Barcelona's sporting director, Deco, recently made his way to meet with Athletic Club's Nico Williams after holding talks with the left-winger's agent. It is said that the 22-year-old Spaniard is keen on joining the La Liga giants this summer, and Barca could utilise a relatively cheap £48.1m release clause to secure the star.",
      "With five goals and five assists this season, Williams has proven himself at the highest level of Spanish football - but Barcelona have been warned that they will have to sell players to get a deal over the line due to financial stipulations. La Liga president Javier Tebas recently said of the club: \"They don’t yet meet the requirements to sign freely, they can’t sign yet under the 1:1 rule. If they want Nico, they will have to sell and adjust their accounts a lot.\"",
      "Elsewhere, it is said that Barcelona are also interested in acquiring the services of Liverpool sensation Luis Diaz, who scored 13 goals and provided seven assists this season to excel in the Premier League. However, with a valuation of around £59m at present according to Transfermarkt, a deal may come as a little too rich for Deco's liking.",
      "With regards to Rashford, it is reported that Barcelona would be looking to secure a loan with an option to buy, but if United are only looking for an immediate permanent transfer, he may need to reassess his options.",
      "While Newcastle United are currently content with Alexander Isak up top, it is reported that the Magpies are willing to table an offer to save Rashford from his current tribulations in the north west, as Eddie Howe sees him as the perfect player to rotate with the £160m Swedish star.",
      "Newcastle are reportedly prepared to shell out as much as £40m to secure Rashford this summer, but it is understood that he is likely to reject any advances from the Tyneside-based team as he continues to hold out for a move to Barca. Given that Newcastle managed a fifth-place finish in the Premier League this season, the side will once again compete in the Champions League in 2025/26 - something that may help turn the head of Rashford ever so slightly.",

      "Manchester United's plan to win the Premier League title by 2028 has been ridiculed by former striker Teddy Sheringham – who branded it “pie in the sky”.",
      "Sheringham also claimed United boss Ruben Amorim will be sacked if he makes a poor start to the new campaign, after ending last season in 15th place – their lowest-ever Premier League finish. Despite that shambolic season, United chief executive Omar Berrada has doubled down on his belief they will lift the Premier League trophy by 2028.",
      "Berrada launched Project 150, the aim of which is for United to win a 21st league title by 2028, the year the club celebrates its 150th anniversary. But after 18 league defeats last season and the failure to secure European football for only the second time in 35 years, Sheringham accused Berrada of living in dreamland with his title claim.",
      "“Omar Berrada’s comments are dreamlike,” said Sheringham. “In football clubs, you’ve got to have small steps to get to places. If you see those small steps and are encouraged and moving in the right direction, that’s when you start looking positively at the future.",
      "“But when people come out with quotes like that, it can be pie in the sky when you’ve got to give the manager time to get things right. For United, the results must improve. It can’t go on like this. The way the talk is – 'it’s alright, we’re gearing for next year, everything is ok for next season'.",
      "“But I think they’re a long way off being anything like the United of old and the pressure will be on Amorim, without a doubt. If he starts the season like the end of last season, there's only one way things will go.”",
      "Sheringham, who scored in United's dramatic 2-1 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999, to clinch the Treble, also said every player should be up for sale – apart from skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“Any player that’s underachieving at United would be surplus to requirements,” said Sheringham. \"And there’s not a lot of players at United who are playing at the top of their form, other than Fernandes.",
      "“So I would think that any offers that come in for anyone playing for United would be very welcome, to be able to get players out and to get others in. Sometimes players fall off a cliff, but I can’t see him [Fernandes] doing that, he’s still got the appetite to go out and do better and lead by example.",
      "“But if Fergie had an offer of £100million for one of his 31-year-old players, going on 32, for the business end of the football club, you’d have to think about things like that.”",
      "Sheringham also said he has sympathy for United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who managed just 10 goals last season, claiming the service provided by his team-mates is simply not good enough.",
      "“We’ve been speaking about Højilund for a good couple of years now,” said Sheringham. “First and foremost, I still think he’s a decent striker, I just think he’s been starved of service at United.",
      "“The way they play, they play with two out and out wingers, no real support apart from Fernandes getting forward. It’s all about the service for centre-forwards and he’s had none. I struggle to think about any striker that you could put in there, that would suffer from the same service and still score goals.",
      "\"You’d have to be some player like Didier Drogba, who did things on his own at times, to score goals. Being a young man as Høljund is and coming into a new country and into the Premier League, trying to understand it, I think he’s had a tough ride.”",

If you look at his style of play, it’s a perfect match with how David Moyes likes to play.

      "\"It's not very often David Moyes has had a 20-30 goals-per-season striker. He’s had strikers who run in behind and create space to bring others into play, so, if he's available, Hojlund could be a tempting option for Everton to sign on loan.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Ander Herrera has been handed a four-match ban after he was sent off for fighting with a security guard in Boca Juniors' Club World Cup opener against Benfica.",
      "The 2-2 draw on Monday was a tense affair as three players were dismissed in total, with Jorge Figal joining Herrera in receiving an early bath, while Andrea Belotti was sent off for Benfica.",
      "Herrera was given his marching orders just before half-time after attempting to barge his way through to speak to the referee while he was in the middle of a VAR review.",
      "The former Spain international had to be held back by security officials and referee Cesar Arturo Ramos reached for his back pocket and issued the red card after being informed of the player's conduct.",
      "Herrera had already been substituted at the time after hobbling off in the 20th minute due to an injury.",
      "The Argentine club confirmed that Herrera and Figal - who was sent off in the 88th minute for a foul on Florentino Luis - have both been banned for four games, pouring doubt on whether they will appear in the competition again.",
      "However, Boca Juniors said they would appeal against the length of the bans, with Ole reporting that the club have questioned why Belotti was only given a two-match ban for a high boot on Ayrton Costa.",
      "The South American side hope they can at least have Figal back for the knockout stages, should they reach it, if his ban is reduced. As it stands, neither player would be allowed to return until the semi-finals.",
      "Herrera's red card comes as the latest set-back to the 35-year-old midfielder, who spent five seasons at Old Trafford and played 189 times. Since joining Boca earlier this year, he has been plagued by injury issues.",
      "His injury setback against Benfica came just a month after he was forced off against Independiente in the Argentinian league and was left in tears.",
      "It was the last of three injury problems in consecutive games, having suffered a hamstring on his debut in January. He was then unable to continue after being brought on in the next game against Newell's.",
      "Herrera was a popular figure during his time at Manchester United as he helped the club win the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League during his stint at Old Trafford - after joining from Athletic Bilbao for around £30m. He later joined PSG in 2019, spending two seasons in Paris before returning to boyhood club Athletic Bilbao for another three years.",

      "In the end, the allure of trophies is what swayed Harry Kane to Bayern Munich in the summer of 2023. Throughout his time at Tottenham, Kane was renowned as one the continent's top strikers and was on the radar of every top European club.",
      "In 2021, Kane did everything he could to try and force a move to Manchester City, including publicly stating his desire to leave Spurs during a round of golf with Gary Neville. However, he waited two more years before Bayern forked out £100m to bring him to Bavaria from North London.",
      "While Bayern won the race, Manchester United had been working on a move for the England captain for some time. When Erik ten Hag first took up the reins at United, it was exclusively revealed by the Mirror that he wanted Kane to be one of his first transfer signings. However, it was not the right time for Kane, as he was determined to become Spurs' record goalscorer.",
      "Moreover, if the England skipper was to leave, it would have been for a club that was immediately ready to challenge for the big trophies and not one that was building or in transition.",
      "After overtaking Sir Jimmy Greaves' Spurs tally the following February, United thought they had the perfect opportunity to sign Kane. Spurs finished outside the top four, during a campaign which saw Antonio Conte be sacked by the club, while United had just won the League Cup, reached the FA Cup final and finished third.",
      "Kane had also publicly said that he wanted to overtake Alan Shearer's record of scoring 260 Premier League goals, seemingly ruling out a move abroad. With City enjoying Erling Haaland's services and Liverpool signing Cody Gakpo at the time, a move to United appeared to be the only realistic Premier League move.",
      "It was a more promising situation than 12 months before when Kane was reluctant to move to Old Trafford after United's struggles under Ole Gunnar-Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. The Red Devils finished sixth with their worst points tally for 32 years and had also endured their fifth consecutive campaign without a trophy.",
      "Kane's motivation to leave Tottenham was driven by his desire to win a major trophy. At the time, the North Londoners were seemingly in a better position to win a title than United.",
      "The England frontman had decided that he would only leave Tottenham for a side that's ready to compete for big trophies immediately and not one that was in transition. Kane was impressive in his final campaign at Spurs, but their 8th placed finish meant the writing was on the wall in regard to his future.",
      "Initially, it was reported that Kane's representatives had a \"secret meeting\" with Paris Saint-Germain, who were interested in a move. PSG transfer chief Luis Campos held an \"informal conversation\" over Kane's future, according to Foot Mercato.",
      "At the time, PSG were embarking on a fresh approach to transfers and were in the process of moving Lionel Messi and Neymar on, so they could build a younger and fresher team. A move to the French capital did not suffice and with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy being reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival, Bayern Munich were in the right place at the right time.",
      "When the rumours about a move to Germany were ongoing, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy urged Kane to move to Bayern and plunder as many goals and trophies as possible. In his column for Daily Mail, Murphy said: \"If Bayern Munich come calling this summer, he should go. It would be hugely sad if a player of his quality finished [his career] without winning a trophy. It's something he himself would regret after retirement.\"",
      "He added: \"Going abroad might cost him Alan Shearer's Premier League goals record but, in the grand scheme of things, that shouldn't put him off. In five years, we could be talking about Harry Kane, Champions League winner with multiple Bundesliga titles and cup medals.",
      "\"I'm sure Kane will get other offers. Manchester United have been mentioned, but he hasn't got time to be part of a team that is building. If he was going to leave, it would be primarily to win trophies from the get-go, which would make Bayern his best option.\"",
      "Kane would go on to snub any other interest from United to secure his £100m move to Bayern. After a disappointing first season saw Bayern fail to win a trophy for the first time in a decade, Kane won the Bundesliga under Vincent Kompany, helping himself to 38 goals and 13 assists in 47 matches along the way.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Omar Berrada is confident Manchester United can return to the Premier League's summit by 2028. A tall order, the chief executive admitted, but very much possible.",
      "And if it is to become a reality this transfer window needs to see a shambolic squad that finished 15th in the season just completed receive some significant surgery. It has already begun following Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival from Wolves, while Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike and Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo remain high on the wishlist.",
      "Yet United have been clear for months that outgoings are a must to fund new arrivals and there is still no clarity on where Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and several others will be playing once the recruitment window closes on September 1. None of those are in head coach Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "Here is the transfer state of play at Old Trafford as things stand.",
      "United are poised to lose academy chief Nick Cox to Everton in a further blow. The Merseyside club are in advanced talks to appoint Cox as their new technical director with a deal expected to be completed imminently.",

      "Some United fans put their hands together for Cantona on his maiden appearance in M16 in September 1992. In the white of Leeds, Cantona attempted an overhead kick from the edge of the area at the Stretford End. He connected cleanly but it was handled dependably by Peter Schmeichel.",
      "The flurry of applause was for the attempt rather than the save. One United fan recalled another asking him why he was clapping a Leeds player.",

It was the only time Cantona ever played against United and he was back in Manchester two-and-a-half months later, this time to be introduced by his new club.",
      "Almost all of Ferguson's significant signings in the early years of the Premier League were top-flight players who had caught his eye. He wanted to sign Roy Keane as soon as the United scout Les Kershaw had watched him on his full debut for Nottingham Forest at Anfield in 1990. Andy Cole scored home and away against United in 1993-94 for Newcastle before his British-record move for £7m in 1995.",
      "Henning Berg was a title winner with Blackburn and Teddy Sheringham was United's scourge in a New Year's Day thrashing at White Hart Lane. Dwight Yorke was influential in one of United's most infamous defeats, the grey-kit grey day in the Villa Park sunshine in August 1995.",
      "United did not just dominate the Nineties on the pitch but in the domestic transfer market. When Ferguson decided to move for a striker in 1995, he considered Cole, Les Ferdinand and Stan Collymore. Ferdinand and Collymore moved to Newcastle United and Liverpool later that year.",
      "Back then, United had the pick of the lot. Now, as they have discovered with their opening offer for Bryan Mbeumo, they cannot just prey on top-flight clubs, particularly one as shrewdly run as Brentford.",

      "United have largely eschewed Premier League recruits in recent years, before and after the Ineos cabal occupied seats in the Old Trafford directors' box. Erik ten Hag protested during his first pre-season in 2022 that he would rather sign Premier League-proven players but lamented their expense.",

Cristiano Ronaldo had premium Premier League pedigree but returned after a 13-year absence. Christian Eriksen, a free agent, had demonstrated he could still hold his own during a brief spell with Brentford.",
      "United's prime three targets this summer were all attached to Premier League clubs. Matheus Cunha's release clause made his £62.5million switch from Wolves straightforward, Mbeumo wants to join United but Liam Delap did not.",
      "All three distinguished themselves against United. \"Cunha wowed the crowd with two virtuoso dribbles, the second halted by the booked Fernandes,\" this correspondent wrote at Molineux on Boxing Day. \"Cunha would slot into Amorim's 3-4-3, a formation that too many players already jar with.\"",

While the focus is inevitably on Ivan Toney, if United are to telephone Brentford about a player it ought to be Bryan Mbeumo.\" Delap antagonised a number of United players in the royal blue of Ipswich Town.",
      "A sceptical friend suggested United's transfer strategy is mirroring Everton's under Ronald Koeman. Across the 2016 and 2017 summers, Everton bought Ashley Williams, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Yannick Bolasie, Michael Keane and Jordan Pickford, essentially the best players at mid-to-lower table Premier League clubs Swansea City, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "Between those transfer windows, Everton drew 1-1 at Old Trafford and Koeman casually remarked he was \"more comfortable\" against United than at Liverpool. Five months later and back at the same stadium, Everton were trounced 4-0 by United.",
      "Jose Mourinho, a colleague of Koeman's from their time as coaches at Barcelona, was in a mischievous mood with his programme notes: \"I hope everybody knows today will be a tough game because we're up against a team that has spent £140m.\"",
      "That got under Koeman's skin at his post-match press conference and he accused Mourinho of not being realistic. Koeman was sacked a month later.",
      "United had bought from Everton that summer. Romelu Lukaku racked up 26 goals for a seventh-placed side that had finished a place below United. He got 28 in his first campaign in Manchester.",
      "Lukaku, of course, once scored a hat-trick against Ferguson's United. It was too late for Ferguson, though. It came in his final match in management at West Brom."

      "With their striker search yet to lead them to a concrete target as of yet, United cannot ignore the fact soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David remains available. He will officially leave Lille when his contract expires at the end of this month and his next move is yet to be determined.",
      "After scoring 25 goals in 2024/25, David, who has formed one of the most impressive goalscoring records in Europe over the last few seasons, is an attractive option for any club in need of a striker this summer.",
      "The Canadian international, 25, scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille over five seasons and it is no surprise he is being linked with a cluster of big-name European clubs, including Juventus, Napoli and Barcelona.",
      "United have loosely been linked with him, too, at various stages over the last few months amid their need for a goal-getter. David was directly involved in 37 goals in the 2024/25 campaign, contributing 12 assists in addition to the 25 goals he plundered.",
      "Seven of his 25 goals came in the Champions League and included strikes against Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool, demonstrating he can deliver the goods at the highest level. He has ten goals in 18 career appearances in Europe's premier club competition.",
      "As a result, many anticipated the former Gent striker's future would have been decided relatively quickly this summer amid the likelihood a queue would form for his signature. However, his current focus is on Canada's CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign, which kicked off with a 6-0 win over Honduras on Wednesday.",
      "With international commitments currently at the forefront of David's mind, his future at club level is unlikely to be decided imminently, meaning there is still time for United to show their hand and attempt to lure the striker to Old Trafford.",
      "Strikers of David's ilk do not come up on the market for free very often, meaning it would be naive of United to turn a blind eye when they are in such desperate need of a reliable goalscorer.",
      "The Canadian has scored 25 goals or more in each of the last three seasons, meaning he has the level of reliability in front of goal United need. For however long he remains available, United should not give up on signing him."

      "Manchester United could freshen up their goalkeeper department this summer but links to any new shot-stoppers have been few and far between.",

      "Tom Heaton has agreed a new contract with the club and will remain United's third choice goalkeeper next season, but there remains doubt over the future of the current second-choice goalkeeper Altay Bayindir.",
      "Despite some penalty heroics in an FA Cup win over Arsenal last season, the Turkey international has looked well below the level required whenever he has stepped up in Onana's absence across his two seasons at the club.",
      "Bayindir lost his place in the Turkey national side in their recent friendlies against Mexico and USA, with Eyupspor goalkeeper Berke Ozer preferred to the 27-year-old.",

      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",

      "With the World Cup next year, Bayindir is keen to get regular football to regain his starting spot for Turkey and reports from his homeland claim he has been offered to Turkish Super Lig outfit Goztepe.",
      "The same report claims Bayindir doesn't want to return to Turkey but hopes to stay in Europe. It has become clear United need an upgrade in that department.",

      "As such, a cut-price move for a goalkeeper with high potential could be the approach United adopt in their search for a new stopper and few meet that criteria more than Angers goalkeeper Yahia Fofana.",
      "The 24-year-old Ivorian has been one of the best goalkeepers in Ligue 1 for the past couple of seasons and is highly rated in France.",
      "In fact, no goalkeeper aged 25 and under across Europe's top five leagues rated higher than Fofana as per gap between goals conceded and expected across last season.",
      "Reports earlier this year even suggested Chelsea legend Didier Drogba recommended his compatriot to his former club, while the likes of Newcastle and Leeds United have been credited with an interest.",
      "His contract at the Raymond Kopa Stadium runs out at the end of next season and, as such, a cut0price fee of around £8.4million is said to be enough to prise him away from the French side.",
      "Paying such a low price for a player who can provide genuine competition for Onana should be considered a no-brainer for United."

      "The Reds have already secured the signature of Wolves star Matheus Cunha, signing him for £62.5million earlier this month after triggering his release clause, and are now in hot pursuit of Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United are prioritising strengthening their attacking department this summer after finishing a second successive Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference. In addition to signing Cunha and wanting to secure Mbeumo's signature, United also want to sign a striker.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, United are yet to settle on an alternative striker target. They are being linked with a plethora of names, but until they can get players off the books and raise funds via sales, they are unlikely to get their hands on the No.9 they so desperately need.",
      "At the other end of the field, however, United are in desperate need for fresh blood. With the expectation of trying to recruit a new goalkeeper, no other defence signings are expected.",
      "In truth, United are very well-stocked in defence. Once Lisandro Martinez returns from his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, head coach Ruben Amorim will have five out-and-out senior centre-backs he will be able to call upon.",
      "Furthermore, Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, despite building their careers as natural full-backs, are also equally capable playing as centre-backs in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "After arriving from Bayern Munich for a £12.8m fee last summer, Mazraoui turned out to be United's signing of the season. He made 57 appearances across all competitions, operating from a collection of different positions.",
      "Often delivering a solid 7/10 performance, Mazraoui was often one of the first names on the team sheet. However, amid the likelihood of Amorim upgrading his squad this summer, there is no guarantee he will be a regular starter in 2025/26.",
      "Fortunately, Mazraoui's versatility means that he is not restricted to playing in just one role, and he has played as a right wing-back, a left wing-back and centre-back since United's transition to a 3-4-2-1 system last November.",
      "\"It's hard to see the best position,\" Amorim said of Mazraoui in April. \"His background is like a full-back, in a defence of four.",
      "\"So in our way of playing, he can play in different positions. I see him as one of the defenders in this moment, because of his quality, he can defend.",
      "\"He can play one against one, defending, attacking. So I'm seeing him with a future to play as a wing-back and as a centre-back.\"",
      "With Amorim prepared to play him either as a wing-back or as a centre-back, it does boost Mazraoui's chances of earning more minutes next season than he may do if he was limited to playing in just one role.",
      "Nevertheless, with competition for places set to be high at centre-back and at wing-back, particularly if United recruit Mbeumo, Amorim will have a selection dilemma to solve. However, it is one he will be only too glad to have."

      "A new frontman, Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad and Bruno Fernandes in the same starting XI is an imposing attack. Ruben Amorim will have Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and probably Joshua Zirkzee to call upon as well.",
      "Beyond the three intended attacking additions, the starting XI may otherwise be untouched. United absolutely need an athletic midfielder but they have to get Manuel Ugarte, a considerable investment at £50.75million, up to speed after a patchy first season.",
      "A new signing's maiden campaign can always be couched as one of adaptation. Ugarte was not Erik ten Hag's pick to shore up a porous midfield and United's style under the Dutchman was no different before his eventual defenestration in October.",
      "Ugarte was entrusted by Ruud van Nistelrooy, a fellow fluent Spanish speaker, during his caretaker stint and he started in 28 of his former Sporting coach Amorim's 42 matches in the dugout. Yet Ugarte ended the season behind Casemiro, regarded as a busted flush, in the pecking order and was benched for the Europa League final.",
      "Casemiro's fine form was reserved solely for Europe and he could be redundant in a season comprising only domestic football. Provisionally, Amorim has to reinstall Ugarte with Fernandes as his probable partner in midfield.",
      "Ugarte and Fernandes have started in a midfield two 11 times and United were beaten on only four occasions. Two of those defeats came three days after Europa League knockout ties, a period when United were half-hearted in their weekend fixtures.",
      "Whether United are able to shift Casemiro or not, they require a major reinforcement in the middle third. Mainoo's positioning is largely irrelevant as the alternative is Toby Collyer, whose three starts for the club have come against teams from Scotland, Romania and League One.",
      "United are about to release two over-the-hill centre backs but they do not need another one. United recruited Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven within seven months, Harry Maguire has had his contract extended while Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw could be permanently relocated to centre half.",

      "\"I always try my hardest when I play to impress people and I think I've been doing that. I just want to continue.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez, recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, should return well before the end of the calendar year. The 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson made a decent transition to the first team, albeit in relatively sedate circumstances (and two defeats).",
      "Talking about a lighter workload in relation to Shaw suggests a punchline is imminent. In all seriousness, with a reduced schedule Shaw could possibly hack it as a left winger if he improves his conditioning. United took a relative punt on Patrick Dorgu and it seems inevitable that the left wing will be a position to strengthen next year when Shaw has a year left on his contract (unless a club has taken him off United's hands by then).",
      "Shaw, 30 next month, started five games last season and all of them were at centre back. United lost four and, privately, Amorim must rue picking him in the Europa League final when his form and fitness did not merit that privilege.",
      "United cannot rely on Shaw, who has played in 27 out of 112 matches in the past two seasons. Harry Amass is a sprightlier left winger though there is significant risk in having a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old vying for such a demanding role with Mbeumo pencilled in on the other flank.",
      "Dorgu's first four months were mixed and one assist was a derisory return. It would not have helped that whenever he had the ball and looked up he saw either Rasmus Hojlund or Zirkzee. Dorgu will not be cut any more slack this time next year.",
      "Staff at United speak positively about the Dane's athleticism and his Serie A pedigree. \"It's been tough, challenging,\" Dorgu admitted. \"But I'm happy I played a lot.",
      "\"I think the manager trusts me and I try to help the team, so just happy to be on the pitch and I try to do my best over here.",
      "\"It's a bit different from my old team but I was playing attacking there as well. I just need to adapt to the players and how everyone moves on the pitch.",
      "\"It's obviously different because the fanbase is so massive. A lot of people talk! Everyone is talking about United. It is difficult for young players but I think if you have the right mentality I think everyone can cope with it and it's about performing on the pitch.\"",
      "Do that and United may be back in the pluses."

      "Manchester United have reportedly made an approach to Real Madrid over the future of Marcus Rashford.",
      "The forward looks set to move on from United this summer, having spent the second half of the season on loan at Aston Villa. That loan move has the option to be made permanent for £40 million, but Villa do not have first refusal.",
      "Barcelona seems to be Rashford’s preferred destination, with reports claiming that he is willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. That move is, however, now in doubt, with the Catalan club reportedly close to signing Nico Williams.",
      "It seems that United may also have doubts over sanctioning a move to the Camp Nou this summer. According to DefensaCentral, previous financial problems at Barcelona have caused worries at Old Trafford that the club may not be able to pay the requested £40 million in a 'timely manner'.",
      "As a solution, United have offered rivals Real Madrid the chance to sign Rashford. New boss Xabi Alonso is on the lookout for a new striker this summer as a direct replacement for Joselu.",
      "The report goes on to say that Real Madrid have already analysed how Rashford could fit into the team and have come to the conclusion that he doesn’t fit the profile that the club wants. It is added that the £40 million transfer fee exceeded the budget set by the club this summer, with a transfer for Rashford therefore described as an 'increrasingly remote option'.",
      "As well as Barcelona, Newcastle United are the latest team to be linked with an interest in Rashford. However, the Magpies are said to prefer a loan deal, with a permanent deal being the preference of United."

      "Later that evening, the well-known player, drink in hand and clad in diamonds, was in a nightclub stood on a table with a microphone in hand. His team had only drawn earlier in the day.",
      "In Moneyball, Brad Pitt's Billy Beane takes a dim view of the Oakland A's first baseman Jeremy Giambi dancing on a table to Give Up The Funk. After instructing Giambi to get back down to earth, Beane aggressively asks, \"Is losing fun?\"",
      "\"No,\" Giambi eventually mutters.",
      "\"What are you having fun for?\"",
      "A few scenes later, Giambi is traded. Jonah Hill's Peter Brand, Beane's assistant and sole ally, is aghast: \"What are you doing?\"",
      "\"Cleaning house.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is not the only recent United manager who might have watched Moneyball and noticed parallels. Like Pitt, Amorim likes to hit the gym. He is also about to clean the house.",
      "Those who know Amorim are struck by how stubborn he is. \"He never changes,\" a confidant said. \"He will die with his idea.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all have to go. Sancho does not have a squad number, Antony is not an option for printing on the club's online store and Rashford is expected to have his number 10 revoked and reassigned to Matheus Cunha. Amorim told Garnacho he can go.",
      "Last week, Rashford's Instagram account uploaded a two-week itinerary for June. Nine out of 14 days were tagged 'Gym, pitch'. Pitching for a new club.",
      "Young United fans have idolised Rashford and many still do. He was not as domineering a presence as Paul Pogba during the club's player-power period or indulged as much as Anthony Martial, which made his transgressions under Amorim and Erik ten Hag - after the latter had restored authority to the United manager's role - so disappointing.",
      "After Sir Alex Ferguson did a U-turn and delayed his retirement in 2002, a United player turned to Dwight Yorke, in exile but optimistic ahead of the apparently impending managerial change. \"That's you f*****d, Yorkie.\" Yorke laughed. Rashford knows there is no route back at United with Amorim in charge.",
      "Ten Hag stood up to Cristiano Ronaldo, so Sancho was always going to be small-fry after he publicly accused the Dutchman of lying. Hardly any teammates sympathised with Sancho and urged him to reoncile with Ten Hag. He never did.",
      "Amorim looked bemused when he was incongruously asked in February whether Sancho could have a future at United. \"Jadon Sancho is not my problem.\" He is now.",
      "United need £14.58m to avoid a loss on Sancho under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. It was amusing, for a while, that Chelsea had agreed an obligation to pay up to £25m for Sancho until someone at Stamford Bridge reached for a calculator.",
      "Antony, La Liga-worthy and back in the Brazil squad, has a higher resale value than Sancho but only a handful of clubs would be in the market for the winger and have the financial wherewithal to hit the magic £32.52m mark. Antony has created a market for himself but United may have to tolerate another season-long loan, burnished by a loan fee and an obligation or option to buy.",
      "Of the four forwards in the departures' lounge, Garnacho is the most regrettable. He could not see the wood for the trees in the days leading up to the Europa League final, despite the giveaway that he would be benched when he was named as a substitute five days beforehand at Chelsea. That marked the first time he had been benched for successive games since January.",
      "Garnacho came on at 0-0, defended fecklessly for Marc Cucurella's winner, was rollocked by Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire and still got his hair bleached on the eve of the final. He very deliberately remained on the San Mames pitch, chewing the fat with Sergio Reguilon, as the United team was announced with all of his teammates were in the dressing room.",
      "Most United punters would have started Garnacho against Tottenham. That he didn't does not excuse his post-match petulance. Speaking in his native tongue, he cast doubt on his future.",
      "It felt telling that in the United corporate section for the semi-final at Athletic Bilbao, the only players whose agents were visibly present were Garnacho's and Kobbie Mainoo's. Garnacho's representatives, Enrique de Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro, appear to have been largely useless in advising their client on his social media etiquette. They made everyone aware they were at Chelsea in January when the club considered bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho all but confirmed his bench berth hours before the Europa League final with a passive aggressive post of his FA Cup final goal. He was at it again when United touched down in Manchester after the tempestuous post-season tour. Garnacho uploaded a picture of the Manchester Airport tarmac with the word \"Finally\", accompanied by crying-with-laughter and praying emojis. Whenever he grows up, it will be away from United.",
      "De Lucas and Cambeiro have allowed Garnacho's sense of entitlement to inflate. He and other puerile teammates had to be told to stop raising their middle fingers for photographs in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Garnacho left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium with sunglasses on at gone 11.30pm at night. He blanked everyone as he strolled through the mixed zone and he looked downright miserable when ordered to fulfil meet-and-greet duties post-match in Hong Kong.",
      "Pogba revelled in Jose Mourinho's sacking on Twitter and was never disciplined. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was well-liked by United players but they also found him to be a soft touch. He had a tendency to squirm whenever the topic turned to Pogba.",
      "Rashford's working relationship with Solskjaer was not as rosy towards the end and he was particularly dismayed by the handling of his shoulder injury towards the end of the 2020-21 season. Solskjaer also sensed a shift in Rashford's demeanour amid a nationwide love-in over his free school meals campaign.",
      "United could not have foresawn Rashford's form nosediving after a career-best season but there were red flags. An antagonistic story the day after he was benched for the Manchester derby in March 2022, his brother's public dalliance with Paris Saint-Germain and a significant change to his entourage.",
      "Dwaine Maynard, Rashford's brother, also rejoiced in Mourinho's misfortune on social media, deriding his reaction to a Rashford miss the day after Rashford netted a matchwinning double against Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "When Beane trades Giambi in Moneyball, the conversation lasts 23 seconds. Some of United's planned departees do not merit a goodbye as long as that."

However, they now appear to be prioritising Spain international Williams in their hopes of strengthening out wide.",

      "Following a disastrous 2024/25 campaign, Manchester United have been left with no choice but to show some ambition in this summer's transfer window.",
      "After wrapping up the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves earlier this month, United now want to make Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo their second signing of the summer.",
      "The Cameroonian, 25, has informed confidants he wants to make the switch to Old Trafford this summer and United have already seen a £55m offer for his signature knocked back. However, discussions with Brentford are understood to remain ongoing.",
      "After developing a habit of signing Dutch-centric under former boss Erik ten Hag, United's recruitment strategy is changing for the better this summer. After signing Cunha and now being in hot pursuit of Mbeumo, it is clear they want proven Premier League talent.",
      "In Cunha, United have secured the signature of a specialist No.10 who fits Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation like a glove. He also scored 15 Premier League goals last season.",
      "By signing a player who has already developed a respectable track record for cutting the mustard in England's top tier, United will be hoping he can hit the ground running at the start of next season.",
      "Expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 berth, Cunha will be responsible for creating goals and scoring them. He had a direct hand in 21 goals in 33 league appearances in 2024/25, assisting six in addition to the 15 he netted himself.",
      "Mbeumo, who is being targeted to play as the right-sided No.10, exceeded Cunha's tally by five, helping himself to 20 Premier League goals. Only Liverpool ace Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak of Newcastle United (23) and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (22) got more.",
      "Mbeumo was one of the stars of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, and it is exciting and refreshing to see United in pursuit of one of the division's best players. If he arrives at Old Trafford, he will, just like Cunha, be expected to hit the ground running.",
      "However, neither of them spent last season at a club where the pressure can be comparable with what it is at Old Trafford. That will be a big test of their character.",
      "But with Cunha having made it clear he wanted to join United and no-one else this summer, and Mbeumo prepared to turn down a reunion with Thomas Frank at Tottenham Hotspur in favour of a move to Old Trafford, it says everything you need to know about their hunger to don the famous red shirt.",
      "Securing Mbeumo's signature would send out a real statement of intent. Although he is not the goalscorer United want to fill the No.9 spot, he would be joining them on the back of a 20-goal season, meaning they would expect him to contribute.",
      "United have not had a player score 20 Premier League goals or more in a single campaign since Robin van Persie plundered 26 in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13. A club of United's stature should be able to rely on a 20-goal-a-season man.",
      "Both Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo went close to scoring 20 Premier League goals in a single season in recent years, each falling short by two in 2020/21 and 2021/22 respectively. Marcus Rashford scored 17 league goals when he scored 30 times across all competitions in 2022/23.",
      "If Mbeumo were to join United and get anywhere close to reaching 20 goals next season, he would instantly enter the conversation to be ranked as their best signing post-Ferguson. Just getting into double figures, particularly when he is not an out-and-out centre-forward, would be considered a success for a debut season at Old Trafford.",
      "United need a natural goalscorer this summer to shoulder the attacking burden, but having a player of Mbeumo's quality and capability in front of goal would ease the pressure. The same can be said of Cunha.",
      "With no United player having scored 20 league goals in a campaign for 12 years, Mbeumo would be a significant upgrade on their current attacking options."

Selling him would also allow United to reinvest the funds in players better suited to Amorim’s system.",
      "talkSPORT's Alex Crook reports that Gyokeres has told family and friends he expects to join Arsenal during the transfer window. While he has a pre-existing relationship with Amorim, the prospect of playing in the Champions League is reportedly tipping the scales in favour of a move to north London.",
      "Sporting Clube de Portugal are said to be seeking around £80m to let Gyokeres leave this summer, and the club is prepared to hold firm in negotiations to secure that fee.",
      "Elsewhere, journalist Ben Jacobs claims that just because the Swede prefers a move to the Emirates Stadium doesn't mean that he's turned down United. There's reportedly no message from him in regard to outright saying no to United. Arsenal are in a more advanced position.",
      "MEN Sport says: Unfortunately, due to the lack of European football, United appears to have never been Gyokeres’ preferred club. It remains to be seen whether he will actually join Arsenal, who are also pursuing Benjamin Sesko. Missing out on a striker of Gyokeres’ calibre would be a significant blow for Amorim and his team, but clubs are well aware that failing to qualify for Europe can be costly. This should only motivate everyone at the club to improve their campaign next season."

      "After joining Manchester United from Chelsea for an initial fee of £55million in July 2023, Mason Mount wasted no time in declaring his best position.",
      "\"I've always seen myself as a midfielder or a No.8 that can obviously get forward, attack, try and score goals and create goals,\" he told MUTV.",
      "\"But I am also able to do the other side as well and defend and help the team when we're under pressure.\"",
      "United signed Mount to add energy to their midfield and become a long-term replacement for Christian Eriksen in the No.8 position. The Dane excelled in his debut season at Old Trafford in 2022/23 but it was clear United needed younger legs in that area of the team.",
      "Operating in a 4-3-3 formation under former manager Erik ten Hag at the time, Mount was expected to join forces with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in United's first-choice midfield. Casemiro had enjoyed an outstanding first season at the club after arriving from Real Madrid in August 2022 and was, at the time, one of the very first names on the teamsheet.",
      "However, Mount's first season in M16 was ravaged by injuries, restricting him to just 20 appearances in all competitions. He played just 14 times in the Premier League, making five starts.",
      "As a result, it was impossible to make a firm judgement on if he would be the ideal long-term replacement for Eriksen. It was hoped the 2024/25 campaign would be much kinder to him on the injury front.",
      "However, the fact he only managed to make 26 appearances in the most recent campaign meant that wish failed to become a reality. A serious hamstring issue sidelined him between mid-December and the beginning of April.",
      "Despite his unavailability, he regularly earned praise from United head coach Ruben Amorim, who declared his admiration for the England international after replacing Ten Hag last November.",
      "He said: \"Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid. You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.",
      "\"I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he's trying to stay fit and we hope he can continue to be fit, to show all the talent that he's shown, for example, in Chelsea.\"",
      "Well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation from his time at Stamford Bridge, there was always a chance Mount could flourish under Amorim, and there was evidence of that towards the end of the campaign.",
      "In Amorim's system, Mount is deployed as one of the two No.10s and not as a No.8. He is a perfect fit the former Sporting Lisbon boss, although he was originally signed to play as a No.8, albeit in a 4-3-3.",
      "Having already added Matheus Cunha to their ranks this summer and attempting to sign Bryan Mbeumo, United could start the new season with a plethora of options to occupy either of the playmaker spots. Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad are all capable of playing as a No.10.",
      "If signed, Mbeumo could be a shoo-in to occupy the right-sided No.10 spot amid the expectation Cunha will command the alternative No.10 spot, meaning Mount may not be a guaranteed starter.",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim values him enormously and he is a good option to be able to bring off the bench. He fits the system perfectly and Mount will be hungry to make up for lost time."

      "Ruben Amorim has told four “bad apples” at Manchester United that they won’t be coming on their tour of the United States in July if they haven’t already found a new club.",
      "Amorim is working hard with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to revamp a United squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",
      "Matheus Cunha has joined the club in a £62.5m move from Wolves and they’ve reportedly made an improved £60m+ bid for Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo after their opening offer of £45m plus £10m in add-ons fell short, but a fresh report claims a transfer U-turn may see the Cameroon international ‘choose Tottenham’ for ‘obvious reasons’.",
      "It’s widely expected that United will have to make significant sales this summer in order to provide Amorim the cash to make the changes he wants and the club is working hard to find buyers for Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho ended last season as the club’s second top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions, to go with ten assists, but was told by Amorim to source a new club at the end of the campaign.",
      "Napoli remain keen on the 20-year-old, whom United reportedly want £70m for, while Chelsea, Aston Villa and Tottenham are also said to be interested, but the Serie A giants may instead move for Sancho, with reports suggesting the winger has ‘verbally agreed’ to a move to Naples.",
      "Marcus Rashford has done everything possible to seal his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona, but the Catalans look set to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club as their new left winger.",
      "Newcastle are thought to be keen on Rashford amid reports of a huge Liverpool bid for their striker Alexander Isak.",
      "There is reportedly ‘growing optimism’ from both Real Betis and Antony that he will prolong his stay with the La Liga side after his impressive return of nine goals and five assists in the second half of last season.",
      "United are said to want £34m for the Brazilian but Betis have proposed a deal which would see United claim a significant percentage of any future sale as it’s thought they can only stump up £17m as an initial payment.",
      "But Stretty News report that Antony also has admirers from the Premier League, claiming: ‘Our sources can also confirm that Aston Villa and Brentford have enquired about Antony, but the tricky winger has clearly given his preference to Betis.’",
      "The Sun claim that if any of the quartet have failed to find a new club by the time United fly to the States in July for their pre-season tour they will be left behind to train alone at Carrington.",
      "A club source said: “Amorim is stamping his authority on the club. It was hard arriving mid-season but he now has the opportunity to shape the team in his image. And he’s wasting no time.",
      "“He only wants players who would die for the shirt and are on board with his ideas.",
      "“He also wants a smaller squad to create an intimate team bond so that everyone gets enough game time to be at peak fitness when called upon. He doesn’t want any bad apples or distractions.”",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed their “target” date to win the Premier League amid his surprise at Ruben Amorim’s dire start.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has set a Premier League “finish” target for head coach Ruben Amorim heading into next season.",
      "A rant from Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘weakened’ the negotiating position of Manchester United for one of their players, meaning his value might have dropped by £20million.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are involved in a ‘three-way Premier League battle’ to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho."

      "He has been an outstanding player for the Villans but made some high-profile errors last season as they finished sixth in the Premier League, missing out on the top five on goal difference.",
      "The Argentina goalkeeper turns 33 in September and is arguably past his peak, but some reports suggest Manchester United are still willing to pay £40million for him.",

      "MORE: Martinez need not act the d*** if he’s Man Utd’s pick to replace oblivious Onana",
      "Onana is attracting interest from Saudi Arabia and United will cash in if a suitable offer arrives, though they are prioritising other areas over the goalkeeper position.",
      "Their hunt for a new striker is far more urgent, while Ruben Amorim is also targeting Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Even so, reports claim that both Martinez and United are open to striking a deal.",

      "It’s said United are not close to signing the World Cup winner at this stage, but ‘the topic remains open’.",
      "The deal ‘depends’ on Onana, with the club ‘not desperate’ to sell the Cameroonian — leaving Martinez in limbo.",
      "He’s definitely ‘not untouchable’, though, and will be sold if a ‘good proposal for all parties’ arrives.",
      "Romano says:",
      "Saudi Pro League clubs maintain interest in Onana and that’s a potential scenario. No proposal has arrived on Man United’s table yet, but this story could develop later this summer and so the club is maintaining a close eye on opportunities for the goalkeeper position in case anything changes with regard to Onana’s future.",
      "Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has been on United’s shortlist since March and is another option being considered by Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s transfer team.",
      "However, there has been ‘positive feedback’ internally that gives the green light for a move for Martinez.",
      "There have been ‘initial contacts’, and the 32-year-old reportedly ‘wants to leave Aston Villa’ after an emotional farewell on the penultimate Premier League weekend.",
      "Even without Champions League football at Old Trafford, Martinez is said to be ‘open’ to the move and ‘says yes’ — if Onana leaves.",
      "The two-time Yashin Trophy winner also has ‘genuine interest’ from Saudi Arabia, but appears keen to stay in the Premier League and wants to be in ‘the best condition’ to represent Argentina at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, Argentine journalist Uriel Lugt has reported that Martinez ‘is willing to go to the Red Devils’, who are ‘advancing in the talks’ to sign him.",
      "Lugt says negotiations between United and Villa are expected to commence ‘in the next few days’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a decision on his “favourite” option to replace one of his current starters.",

      "From a 38-year-old Jamie Vardy teaching Rasmus Hojlund how to finish, to Ben Mee returning to Burnley, we’ve reassigned 10 players released by Premier League clubs to new homes.",
      "",
      "Jamie Vardy to Manchester United\nIan Watson wrote at length about Vardy to United and here we are, banging that drum again. Does it make sense? Yes, it kind of does. And Watto is a United fan, so…",
      "Vardy is 38, which makes him very much a signing for the present, and a one-year deal is surely the only sensible option for the Red Devils. We’re not saying he has to be signed and given the No.9 shirt. No, he’d take on a Jonny Evans-like role, mentoring the rather hopeless-looking Rasmus Hojlund into a proper fox in the box, turning Joshua Zirkzee into an actual No.9, and helping Matheus Cunha score even more goals.",
      "The only natural striker Ruben Amorim has right now is Hojlund, a £70million investment United surely aren’t ready to chuck in the bin for a shiny new toy. Having already missed out on Liam Delap, United need a cost-effective striker who can relieve some pressure on Hojlund’s still-young shoulders.",
      "The more we talk about and justify this transfer, the more sense it makes. It surely won’t happen…but never say never.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker-Peters to Aston Villa\nWhen Southampton were relegated in 2023, Walker-Peters stayed to help them bounce back, despite being primed for a move to a top-flight club with his stock as high as it had ever been. Two years on, the Saints are going down again, this time without the 28-year-old, whose stock has dipped but who’s available on a free, which will convince someone he’s worth a punt.",
      "The two-cap England international is in his prime and has proven he can play both right- and left-back. That sort of versatility should land him a decent move. There were so many options that we eventually settled on Aston Villa.",
      "Is that because he ended up there on my Football Manager save? Maybe a smidgen. But Matty Cash is easily upgradeable, and Walker-Peters could well leapfrog him in Unai Emery’s right-back pecking order.",
      "",
      "Christian Eriksen to Everton\nDavid Moyes likes his defensive midfielders to be, well, defensive, but gives players like Iliman Ndiaye licence to roam. Eriksen does not have Ndiaye’s agility or dynamism, but his technical ability remains outstanding, and he’d be a real asset offensively.",
      "His days as a Premier League starter are behind him, but Eriksen still offers a superb creative spark off the bench. He created 2.63 chances from open play per 90 in the 2024/25 Premier League; only Bruno Fernandes, Bukayo Saka and Kevin De Bruyne created more.",
      "One simple thing Moyes changed when replacing Sean Dyche was the volume of through balls his players attempted, which made Everton more dangerous on the break. It’s just a shame Beto so often lacked composure and finesse.",
      "",
      "Victor Lindelof to Wolves\nLike Walker-Peters, this one almost involved drawing names out of a hat. Bournemouth were our first pick, then Everton were considered (they do love a United cast-off), and then we looked at the promoted trio of Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland. In the end, we landed on Wolves.",
      "They’re set to lose Craig Dawson and are severely lacking quality at centre-back, so Vitor Pereira could do a lot worse than a player who spent eight years at United looking a bit out of his depth.",
      "Lindelof wasn’t dreadful, but far from excellent. He was painfully average – which shouldn’t be enough at United, but often is these days.",
      "The Swede just screams Turkish Super Lig, so we’re half-expecting that move. We’re just not sure if he’s more Besiktas or Trabzonspor.",

      "Abdoulaye Doucoure to Sunderland\nDoucoure leaves Everton as a cult hero and deserving of a new adventure at 32.",
      "The ex-Watford midfielder is another very Turkish Super Lig-type, and we also see the appeal of Saudi Arabian and Qatari riches. But we’d love him to stay in the Premier League as the under-rated sh*thouse that he is.",
      "Sunderland need to replace Jobe Bellingham, and Doucoure would be a smart option. Leeds have also been linked, and again…we like it.",
      "",
      "Ben Mee to Burnley\nThe sentiment is off the charts, folks. An emotional return to Turf Moor would tug at the heartstrings of even the most cynical football fan.",
      "Mee spent 11 years at Burnley and, let’s be honest, that’s doing some very heavy lifting here. But the Clarets clearly need a different transfer approach to the one that got them relegated in 2023/24. Vincent Kompany splurged on foreign youngsters and – shock – it didn’t work.",
      "Mee would be a shrewd addition for a defensively sound side looking to maintain their stinginess in the top flight. For what it’s worth, we’re giving Scott Parker until November.",
      "",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin to West Ham\nEverton are ‘liaising with the representatives of Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin’ but over a week later, neither has signed a new deal. Fans will be happy to see the back of both – Keane because he’s been rubbish, Calvert-Lewin because he’s always injured.",
      "The latter’s injury record means no one will sign him as a first-choice striker, but when fit, Calvert-Lewin is a real handful and a very solid all-round No.9.",
      "So we’ve picked a club who need depth up front and have better options already: West Ham.",
      "Graham Potter has lost Evan Ferguson after his loan ended, and with Michail Antonio out of contract and in talks over a new deal (more out of respect after that car crash and broken leg than anything else), there’s a squad spot going.",

      "They saw a bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rejected by Brentford for the 25-year-old earlier this month, but were confident of wrapping up the deal with Mbeumo keen on the move to Old Trafford.",

      "In a bid to avoid Spurs swooping in, transfer expert Duncan Castles claims United have now submitted a new offer worth more than £60m for Mbeumo.",
      "Although it’s not clear what the make-up of that deal is, no matter the up-front fee and add-ons, it looks set to be rejected by Brentford as the Bees hold out for a fee closer to £70m for the winger, who got 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "The Bees may also be boosted by Castles’ revelation that “there’s a good chance” that Mbeumo might “choose Spurs ahead of Manchester United”, offering the prospect of a bidding war between the two clubs.",

City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nWith Andre Onana needing punted and United focusing on other positions, this one feels unlikely. It’s a weird one; we don’t think it’s a load of rubbish, but it’s simply unrealistic right now.",

      "18) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",

The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, but Palace are unlikely to lower their demands too much after turning down a £70m Spurs bid in January.",

The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season. He’d be a brilliant Guehi replacement.",

Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse.

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",

Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",

      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",

Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez.

It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",

      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, but again, that doesn’t really matter for our purposes. Arteta’s is a quirky situation where the range of possible outcomes is such that he sits uncommonly prominently in this list but would be even closer to the top of any possible manager of the year list.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "5) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games, Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo. There’s also the added early-season headache of those Conference League qualifiers, too, which none of our other European entrants have to worry themselves with.",
      "",
      "4) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack. As with Arteta – perhaps even more so – what we’re doing here isn’t quite as straightforward as ‘do you think this manager will do well or what’.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "1) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",

      "​​Mykhailo Mudryk could face a doping ban of up to four years after he was charged by the FA but he is not the first footballer to be hit with a stint on the sidelines.",
      "While it may be hard to imagine if you ever saw Mudryk play for Chelsea, the Ukrainian was in fact using the performance-enhancing drug meldonium, which helps with the body’s cardiac functions.",
      "The Ukrainian first pinged the FA’s anti-doping tests in December before his second sample also came back positive and while he waits to see how long he could be out of action for, we’ve taken a look through the annals of football history to find which other players have been caught doping…",
      "",
      "Kicking us off is former Ajax, Barcelona, Milan, Juventus and Inter midfielder turned unlikely Barnet manager Edgar Davids.",
      "Football’s most famous glasses-wearer was plying his trade in Turin for Juve in the 2000/01 season but was hit with an extended period on the sidelines after failing a drugs test.",
      "Davids, along with Lazio defender Fernando Couto, tested positive for the steroid nandrolone, and the Dutchman was initially given a five-month ban. Davids appealed the decision, maintaining his innocence, and his suspension was reduced to four months.",
      "Davids was the eighth player in Serie A to test positive in that season alone.",
      "2001 was not a great year for the Dutch FA as not only did Davids fail a drugs test, Jaap Stam did too.",
      "In an almost carbon copy of Davids’ case, Stam was playing in Serie A and was also found guilty of taking nandrolone.",
      "The former Manchester United defender was at Lazio and was perhaps lucky to avoid a longer ban after the Italian Olympic Committee suggested an eight-month absence, a recommendation rejected by the Italian FA.",
      "",
      "The off-field life of Kolo Toure can sometimes feel like it was written by a misfiring AI but when he was not pretending to be a used car salesman so he could pull women, the Ivorian was getting into trouble with doping control.",
      "In May 2011 and while at Manchester City, Toure was banned for six months after testing positive for an unspecified substance.",
      "How did he come into contact with the outlawed drug? Simple, he took some of his wife’s diet pills.",
      "That reasoning satisfied the FA commission chairman, who ruled that Toure did not intend to enhance his performance, meaning he received a more lenient ban.",
      "The back-dated six-month suspension began in March as Toure became the first Premier League player since 2004 to be caught doping.",
      "Given Adrian Mutu had already been at five clubs by the age of 24, Chelsea should perhaps have wondered if signing the Romanian was a good idea.",
      "The answer to that became an emphatic ‘no’ in September 2004 when he tested positive for cocaine.",
      "But despite being given a seven-month ban by the FA, his biggest punishment actually came from the club as Chelsea took Mutu to court, arguing he had broken the terms of his contract.",
      "A committee ruled in Chelsea’s favour and after three years of courtroom back and forth, the FIFA Dispute Resolution ordered Mutu to pay Chelsea back his transfer fee.",
      "A €17,173,990 bill landed on the Romanian’s doorstep and try as he might to overturn it – including a 2018 appeal to the European Court of Human Rights – Mutu could not get out of it.",
      "One of the most famous doping cases in English football came at the country’s biggest club with controversy surrounding Manchester United.",
      "On the morning of September 23, 2003, a training session had just finished at United’s Carrington headquarters when a representative of UK Sport arrived for a routine drugs test.",
      "Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and John O’Shea were all randomly selected, as was Rio Ferdinand, but the defender was nowhere to be seen.",
      "Ferdinand had already headed home and his excuse for missing it? He forgets things.",
      "‘I knew that forgetting was a pretty lame defence for my actions, but it was the truth,’ Ferdinand wrote in his book. ‘I never remember anything.’",
      "Pictures of him in Manchester city centre buying new bed linen did little to please the testers who had already left by the time Ferdinand made contact with the club.",
      "Two days later, he did produce a negative test but the damage was done and he was banned for eight months, ruling him out of Euro 2004.",
      "To this day, Ferdinand denies any mischief and Sir Alex Ferguson said in his 2013 book: ‘My indignation endures to this day.’",

      "The Cameroon keeper went down the Toure route of excuses by blaming his wife, stating he had mistakenly taken medicine prescribed to her after he started feeling unwell.",
      "Onana blamed “almost identical” packaging to what he believed was aspirin but his cries fell on deaf ears with UEFA handing him a 12-month suspension. But an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport saw that reduced to nine months.",
      "",
      "The second goalkeeper to appear on this list is Mark Bosnich, who was another to test positive for cocaine.",
      "The Australian said his drink had been spiked after he tested positive in 2002 but the FA still deemed him in breach of their doping control regulations.",
      "Another Chelsea player, Bosnich had his contract terminated but as he joined on a free, he did not have to pay back any transfer fee.",
      "",
      "Described by the New York Times as ‘a legend in South American football’, Paolo Guerrero is practically the Lionel Messi of Peru.",
      "The now 41-year-old, still playing by the way, was of the best talents the country had ever produced, being recruited by the Bayern youth academy before playing 27 league games for the German club, but his career threatened to fall of the rails after he tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine at a World Cup qualifier against Argentina in October 2017.",
      "But it was the length of Guerrero’s ban that proved to be one of the more interesting aspects of the case. Initially, FIFA gave him a 12-month ban but their appeals committee reduced it to six.",
      "In April 2018, Guerrero filed an appeal to CAS to have it reduced further but at the same time, the World Anti-Doping Agency filed their own case, saying it should have been more.",
      "The Swiss body ruled in WADA’s favour, increasing the ban to 14 months, though Guerrero received an incredible slice of leniency when the Swiss Federal Tribunal agreed to temporarily suspend his ban, allowing him to play at the 2018 World Cup.",
      "Following the end of the tournament in Russia, Guerrero’s 14-month ban was re-imposed.",
      "Let’s be honest, Diego Maradona was always going to be on this list, wasn’t he?",
      "For as gifted as he was on the pitch, the Argentine was troubled off it.",
      "It was during his time in Barcelona when he became addicted to cocaine but it was when he moved to Naples that the problem took hold of him.",
      "In 1991, he was banned for 15 months after testing positive, which proved to be an undignified end to his time at Napoli.",
      "After his suspension, he went to Sevilla, staying for just a single year, but there was to be a further drugs scandal in 1994. Off the back of Argentina’s 2-1 World Cup group stage win over Nigeria, Maradona was selected for a drugs test and pinged for five variants of ephedrine, a stimulant banned by FIFA.",
      "As a result, he was given a second ban of 15 months.",
      "Samir Nasri will never want to hear the words ‘Drip Doctor’ again after the 2018 scandal became an internet meme for the ages.",
      "As a gift from his girlfriend, Nasri was signed up to an IV drip procedure through the Drip Doctors company but the former Arsenal player enjoyed the treatment so much he slept with the nurse.",
      "The reason we all know about this is because Nasri’s girlfriend found out, logged into his Twitter and started posting that the ‘whore comes and f**ks the same night’.",
      "After a wrestle to get back into his own Twitter, Nasri insisted he had been hacked and while UEFA were not too concerned about his personal life, they did take note of just what that IV drip included.",
      "A drugs test showed Nastri had an assortment of vitamins, minerals and micronutrients and while that is allowed in small quantities, the Frenchman had been given over 500 millilitres of the stuff.",
      "UEFA initially handed him a six-month ban before it was increased to 18.",
      "One of the most famous cases in recent years came with Paul Pogba who in September 2023 tested positive after a non-endogenous testosterone was found in his sample.",
      "Another sample produced the same result and in February 2024, Pogba received a four-year ban in what looked like a death sentence for his career.",
      "However, the former Manchester United midfielder took his case to CAS who agreed to reduce the ban to 18 months, clearing Pogba to play from March this year.",
      "But, with his Juventus contract being terminated in November, the 2018 World Cup winner has not yet been able to find a new club.",
      "The longest ban to date ever handed out was from the Brazilian Doping Control Authority to Flamengo forward Gabriel Barbosa.",
      "The interesting thing about this particular ban is that Gabriel was not banned for failing a drugs test but instead making it hard to even complete one.",
      "Ahead of a Flamengo game in the Rio De Janeiro state league, officials tried to take a urine sample from the player but were unable. As a result, the case was taken to the Anti-Doping Sports Justice Court, who narrowly voted 5-4 in favour of giving the Brazilian forward a two-year ban.",
      "After the verdict, Gabriel said he planned to appeal to CAS and in April 2024, the Swiss court paused the ban, allowing for a full investigation before it comes into effect.",

      "Everybody but The Sun agrees that Trent Alexander-Arnold was poor on his Real Madrid debut while Marcus Rashford SHOCK emerges.",
      "",
      "Trenter the dragon\n‘Trent Alexander-Arnold makes underwhelming start to life at Real Madrid at Club World Cup’ was the headline in the Mirror, while we concluded that it ‘wasn’t great’ as we detailed everything he did – there really wasn’t much – against Al-Hilal.",
      "Meanwhile in Spain, the Liverpool turncoat was described as ‘badly exposed’ as he ‘failed to contribute’. Most damningly, Sport noted that he was ‘physically far from his best’.",
      "So we were a tad surprised to see the headline in The Sun: TAA DAA: ‘Trent Alexander-Arnold already showing signs of old class in Real Madrid shirt even if he’s put a new name on the back.’",
      "Take a guess which newspaper/website is boycotted by Liverpool fans.",
      "‘Here’s why the ex-Liverpool star can be quietly pleased with his debut in the Miami heat,’ say The Sun. And we really want to know why, because a 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal is really quite embarrassing for Real Madrid. And we know that he did something close to the square root of f*** all in that 1-1 draw.",
      "‘An attacking threat?’ ask The Sun. Well, he created the sum total of one chance in 64 minutes so we would say not. Football Espana say ‘he struggled to make an impact in attack before being substituted’ and the statistics certainly back that up.",
      "But according to The Sun: ‘It was his initial pass deep in his own half that started the move which ended with Gonzalo Garcia’s 34th-minute opener. The England international pumped his fists into the air when the ball hit the back of the net.’",
      "Ah, the glorious pre-pre-pre-pre-assist. He really is ‘already showing signs of old class’.",
      "The Sun then note that he ‘looked defensively solid’. Which is true if you ignore all the times he failed to track his winger, the time he was outjumped at a corner, the times players drifted past him (he did not make one tackle) and the time he appeared to entirely forget he was a defender. Apart from all that, he ‘looked defensively solid’.",
      "",
      "The SHOCKING sensible transfer of the summer\nListen, we all do it. We all leave names and clubs out of headlines to create a ‘curiosity gap’. We all trump up transfer rumours as unexpected or surprising when the only unexpectedly surprising thing is that somebody has been arsed to make it up.",
      "But sometimes transfer rumours are not unexpected or surprising, but actually make perfect sense.",
      "And with that we turn to MailOnline:",
      "Marcus Rashford ’emerges as SHOCK target for English Champions League club’ – as Man United outcast looks to get his career back on track this summer",
      "First, those quote marks are quoting absolutely nobody, but that is apparently normal in 2025.",
      "Second, what is remotely shocking (sorry, SHOCKING) about Newcastle United wanting Marcus Rashford.",
      "It’s literally one of the most obvious and sensible suggestions we have heard in this transfer window; it’s a Champions League club who have been very clearly targeting Premier League players, targeting a Premier League player with extensive Champions League experience. It literally worked for Aston Villa in January.",
      "In what way is that remotely a SHOCK? It’s not like he’s joining Liverpool…",

      "Erosion of Boxing Day matches a betrayal of English football tradition: Premier League has chucked the much-loved festive fixture in the bin, leaving us old timers with a fading memory of how things used to be",
      "And the Telegraph‘s Jim White absolutely knows this, writing: ‘True, the league has suggested that December 26 is open for switches should the broadcasters wish to schedule on that day. But even if the TV bosses take up their full allocation, it would mean no more than five top-flight games played on Boxing Day.’",
      "Want to guess how many Premier League games were played on Boxing Day 2023?",

      "We look forward to June 2026, when White will presumably write hundreds of words about the triumphant return of a great ‘tradition’ when every single Premier League game is scheduled for Boxing Day.",
      "Not because a few old old-timers spat out their dummies, but because it’s a Saturday.",
      "Alexander-Arnold was ‘badly exposed’ on his Real Madrid debut and ‘failed to contribute offensively’ according to an unimpressed Spanish press.",
      "Newcastle are ‘ready to offer’ the Manchester United star an escape route and are ‘confident of providing him with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’.",

      "Having taken our esteemed editor’s instruction to be on ‘Trentwatch’ all too literally, here is absolutely everything the Liverpool turncoat did (and didn’t do) on his Real Madrid debut.",

      "According to a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes on Monday the Red Devils have made a genuinely unbelievable ‘offer of €150m [£127m] for Raphinha’, having found some loose change down the back of one of their canteen chairs now collecting dust in a warehouse.",
      "‘The figure has surprised even in the Camp Nou offices’ the report claimed, ‘where a proposal of such magnitude was not expected by the Brazilian winger’.",

      "While it’s not yet clear how long Barcelona will look to spread out the payments for Williams, the Spain international’s release clause stands at €58m [£49.5m], which is cash they don’t have on hand but would do if they accept United’s mammoth and genuinely unbelievable ‘offer’ for Raphinha.",

      "A transfer insider has suggested that the impending signing of Bryan Mbeumo at Manchester United means there’s a “limited” chance their top scorer keeps his role, but he feels he’ll be “immense” elsewhere.",
      "United have already moved to rectify their forward issues this summer. Last season, during their 15th-placed Premier League campaign, they scored 44 goals in 38 games.",
      "They have signed Matheus Cunha to add some firepower, and Bryan Mbeumo could follow, after 20 goals for Brentford last season.",
      "There’s a battle ongoing between United and Tottenham for the forward, but it’s believed Mbeumo wants to join the Red Devils, while a recent report suggested Spurs had ‘cooled’ their interest as they saw the deal to beat the rival side as ‘impossible’.",
      "That signing, and other United decisions, while push Amad Diallo out of his role, according to insider Graeme Bailey.",
      "He told TBRFootball: “Amad probably knows he’s heading towards playing the right wing-back role.",
      "“If you recall, in [Ruben] Amorim’s first game in charge against Ipswich Town, that’s where Amad played. When he says right wing-back role, a wing-back role in a Ruben Amorim system is not the wing-back role that we usually associate with English football.",
      "“I think the Cunha and Mbeumo signings, and [Joshua] Zirkzee still being there, tell us that the chances of Amad playing as an attacking midfielder are quite limited next season.",
      "“We might see Amad play in that right-side role, that’s what [the transfer moves] are telling us. We know Amad is prepared to play there, he’s done it a number of times for Amorim, and let’s not forget the players who played that position for Amorim – [Geovany] Quenda at Sporting and look how good he is. He’s not a dissimilar type of player.",
      "“It tells us that, while he likely won’t play an attacking-midfield role at United, Amad is still very much in Amorim’s thinking. It’s a position, if they do it right, he’ll become an immense threat in, that [right wing-back] role.”",
      "Diallo was United’s joint-top scorer in the Premier League last season, with eight goals alongside eight assists, and a nunber of those came from the attack.",
      "However, he also showed he was capable of starring in the wing-back position. Amad scored a hat-trick against Southampton in a game he started as a wing-back, and there were more goals and assists in other games he played there, too.",
      "There’s now a ‘good chance’ Mbeumo will snub Man Utd for Tottenham for two ‘obvious reasons’ as a new £60m+ bid has been submitted for the Brentford star.",
      "Thomas Frank has given the green light for Tottenham to push for the signing of Eberechi Eze while Spurs have dealt Man Utd a blow in the race for Bryan ...",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the striker he “wants” the Red Devils to sign is “waiting” for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are among the three clubs in the race to sign Nottingham Forest standout Callum Hudson-Odoi.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have edged closer to making their next signing as Tottenham Hotspur have ‘cooled’ their interest.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon."

      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "Manchester United have entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, according to Sky Germany.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea are also thought to be interested in the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal.",
      "It is understood United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for Ekitike with Frankfurt demanding around £85m (€100m).",
      "United are in the market for a striker after the arrival of Wolves' Matheus Cunha and the potential signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Chelsea and Liverpool considered among the next landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers."
