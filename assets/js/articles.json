      "Daily Mirror Manchester Football Correspondent, covering Manchester United and Manchester City. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "After the pain and misery of last season, there was much for Ruben Amorim to be optimistic about after Manchester United's opening US tour game.",
      "Ending last season in 15th place – United's lowest finish for 51 years – and missing out on Europe for only the second time in 35 years have made this a crucial pre-season.",
      "Against that backdrop, United began their three-game tour of the States with an impressive performance against Premier League rivals West Ham at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.",
      "Here is what United boss Amorim will have learned from his team's hard-fought win...",
      "New £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha impressed with his attacking threat and industry, while midfielder Manuel Ugarte pressed with intensity and striker Rasmus Hojlund looked sharp and hungry.",
      "There were other plus points for Amorim – Kobbie Mainoo's influence in a deeper midfield role, Patrick Dorgu's marauding runs down the left and the enduring quality of skipper Bruno Fernandes, who gave United a first-half lead from the penalty spot.",
      "The crowd at the venue for next year's World Cup final may have been sparse – the 80,000-capacity stadium half-full at most – but fans were treated to a competitive game.",
      "Former United managers have made wholesale changes at half-time in pre-season games, but Amorim's plan was to play his starting line-up until the 70th minute, to build up their fitness levels, before making substitutions.",
      "Amorim picked a strong side, although new £71m signing Bryan Mbeumo was left out, with his pre-season preparation slightly behind that of his team-mates.",
      "Pre-season games, particularly the opening ones, can be tepid affairs, with players minded to ease themselves into games gently, for fear of injury or pushing themselves too much.",
      "But United played with a fervour and commitment, epitomised by Ugarte's willingness to snap into tackles and win back possession within seconds of his side losing it.",
      "United served notice of their intent early on, Cunha winning the ball just outside his own area, Dorgu finding Fernandes, who in turn put Hojlund through on goal.",
      "The much-maligned striker, who managed just 12 goals last season, outpaced Max Kilman before striking a post with a left-footed effort.",
      "Minutes later United were in front after West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola dropped the ball then fouled Ayden Heaven in a clumsy attempt to retrieve it, Fernandes coolly dispatching the resulting spot-kick.",
      "With Amorim urging his players to maintain their rhythm and intensity, all the more impressive in the oppressive 80 F temperature, United continued to dominate.",
      "Hojlund scooped a shot over in the 16th minute, while Cunha's tenacity in retrieving the ball and winning a corner led to Leny Yoro heading just wide. Ugarte won possession and fed Amad, who applied a clinical finish, but the goal was ruled out for offside.",
      "But United doubled their lead in the 52nd minute, Mainoo intercepting a poor pass out from Areola then finding Fernandes, who steered a sublime finish into the top left corner.",
      "With the 70 minute mark looming and United's starting line-up tiring, Jarrod Bowen pulled a goal back for Hammers with a fine angled finish, which prompted Amorim to make 10 outfield changes slightly earlier than he planned.",
      "Those who came on struggled to keep possession as assuredly as the starting line-up, allowing West Ham more time on the ball and meaning United came under sustained pressure to maintain their lead and see out the game, which they duly did, with Altay Bayindir making a fine save to deny Bowen a second goal deep into added time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo didn't feature for Manchester United against West Ham because he is behind in his preparations compared to the rest of his teammates.",
      "The £71 million signing from Brentford completed the move a day before the squad flew out to Chicago for the club's pre-season tour in the United States. He was signed after the drab 0-0 draw against Leeds in Stockholm, Sweden.",
      "Mbeumo has trained with his new colleagues in recent days and travelled to the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey but was a notable absence on the teamsheet. It appears he is not quite match fit, with Brentford starting their pre-season preparations a week after United.",
      "Amorim has already proven himself a tough manager when it comes to fitness and Mbeumo's absence follows a similar trend of decisions by the Portuguese. Noussair Mazraoui was another key player missing, with the defender absent through a 'knock'.",
      "Fellow new recruit Matheus Cunha, who arrived after his £62.5 million release clause at Wolves was triggered, did start in what was a reasonably strong starting XI against West Ham.",
      "Altay Bayinder started in goal amid Andre Onana's own injury problems, with Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven ahead of him. Amad and Patrick Dorgu operated in the wing back roles with Mainoo and Ugarte playing central midfield. Bruno Fernandes, Rasmus Hojlund and Cunha led the line.",
      "United ran out 2-1 winners thanks to two goals from Fernandes. Jarrod Bowen pulled one back on the hour mark as the Red Devils held out for a win.",
      "Amorim's team will face Bournemouth on Wednesday but Mbeumo will have to wait beyond that to get his first minutes. The United boss is instead hopeful Mbeumo will play against Everton on Sunday. While his fitness may be a slight concern, there should be no worries over his mentality.",
      "\"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up,\" the forward declared upon signing.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",

      "After recording 45 minutes of first team action against Leeds, Matheus Cunha played another 65 minutes for Manchester United against West Ham on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's side won the encounter 2-1 and while Bruno Fernandes netted both in a man of the match display, Cunha also impressed.",
      "The 26-year-old arrived from Wolves for £62.5 million and, quite frankly, he's a player United have been crying out for. Forgetting the goals he will bring, Cunha's physicality and zealous nature will be warmly welcome at Old Traffford.",
      "After just two minutes, Cunha's best work was at the other end of the pitch. Mucking in on the edge of United's box, the Brazilian won the ball back to turn over possession. His aggression ultimately led to Hojlund baring down on goal and hitting the post.",
      "There's a clear need for him to prove himself and there was no greater example than his long shot at goal midway through the first half. Maybe it was a little eager but it was positive and direct.",
      "His ability to use either foot, as he feigned on one and hit it with the other, will also prove problematic for defenders.",
      "After 35 minutes when his pass to Hojlund on the edge of the box didn't pay off, his verocious nature to win the ball back led to him earning the opportunity of a shot on goal. It was ultimately blocked but the desire was more promising than the end product.",
      "Amorim stuck with his starting XI at half-time, resisting the urge to make wholesale changes to get as many minutes in as many different legs as possible. Perhaps a hint that he is finding his strongest XI already. Cunha is very much a part of that.",
      "Just moments into the second half Cunha broke through the Hammers midfield, driving the ball forward more like a rugby player than a footballer. He did something similar against Leeds too.",
      "That ability to be tough to tackle and burst through the ranks as United transition from defence to attack is something they desperately need.",
      "And to prove his earlier defensive heroics weren't a fluke, on the hour mark he was sliding to win the ball again. His crucial touch was followed by Amad also sliding to win the ball. United won it back.",
      "With the exception of the ever-exasperated Fernandes, it oftentimes felt last season as though only the young Ivory Coast international was the one willing to chase down every ball and put in the effort. Cunha is willing too.",
      "While attitude question marks off the pitch remain, there is no doubting his voracious nature on it.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's summer has seen them land two marquee arrivals, costing them more than £120million, but more was expected of the Red Devils in the transfer market.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha will bolster the team's attack with Ruben Amorim claiming either man could play as a central striker if needs must. The United boss has also claimed he's happy to press on with his squad as it looks despite the lack of change.",
      "He said during the club's pre-season tour: \"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player. If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last term, but Amorim has been afforded the chance to work with his team on his philosophy and system throughout pre-season. That wasn't a luxury he had last term with United's recruitment potentially slowing down.",
      "United have been linked with moves for the likes of Emi Martinez, having a loan approach rejected by Aston Villa, and the MEN understands there is not currently a budget set aside to fund a new No.1 for the club.",
      "Despite not having the funds to go after a new goalkeeper Andre Onana has made it clear he wants to stay in Manchester and has received reassurances that he won't be sold or replaced.",
      "The most likely departure there would perhaps be Altar Bayindir with Tom Heaton, the veteran goalkeeper on the club's books, recently extending his deal. Onana was dropped for a match last term by Amorim, but he still remains the first choice going into the new season.",
      "Amorim has dismissed the notion that Mbeumo and Cunha both choose to move to Manchester to increase their pay cheques given they had offers elsewhere that would've seen them play in the Champions League. The United boss claimed it is \"lies\" to consider the duo only made the switch because of financial motives.",
      "He told the club's website: “Cunha and Bryan, they had different solutions [offers]. They had Champions League offers. And they wanted to come here. People that say that they come here because of the money… that is a lie. That I know for sure. So, I’m really happy with that.",
      "“That is the key point. They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project. And then one really important thing is that they want to come here.\"",
      "Cole Palmer has been tipped to join move to United in the future despite his Chelsea deal tying him down until 2033. Former Red Devils coach Rene Meulensteen told Grosvenor Casino: \"It’s almost a public secret that Cole Palmer is a Manchester United fan, what surprised me is how he slipped through the fingers of United with him being at Manchester City and then getting his chance at Chelsea.",
      "“He is a player that can make a difference, could he play for United in the future? Yeah, I can't see why not. Obviously, he's got a long-term contract with Chelsea, but sometimes things don't work out and players and clubs fall out, then United would be interested and it could be a really good destination for him. He is a United fan after all and he is a player that would bring United back to a higher level.\"",

      "Manchester United did something they're not very good at and scored twice against West Ham to win at the MetLife on Sunday morning.",
      "United travelled to New Jersey from Chicago to take on the Hammers at the same venue where Chelsea hoisted the Club World Cup alongside Donald Trump not two weeks ago. And it was their captain they relied upon once again with Bruno Fernandes scoring both.",
      "The first came from the spot after a messy Alphonse Areola catch led to Ayden Heaven being fouled. The second came just after the interval after another mistake from the Hammers keeper. Kobbie Mainoo capitalized to tee up Fernandes who produced a sublime finish.",
      "Jarrod Bowed grabbed one back on the hour mark and had another late chance stopped by Altay Bayinder as United grabbed a rare but much-needed win.",
      "The starting XI: Altay Bayindir, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Patrick Dorgu, Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha, Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "And it stayed that way until the 65th minute. The fact this team lasted more than an hour shows you where Amorim's head is with his preferred players. Add to the context Bryan Mbeumo wasn't quite ready, Noussair Mazraoui was carrying a knock, and Joshua Zirkzee wasn't in the squad, it's clear the United boss is using pre-season to get his strongest side playing their strongest football as soon as possible. It's a luxury he didn't get last year.",
      "United looked sharp, carried a zip and an energy to their play that hasn't been seen for some time. Most pleasing for Amorim will no doubt be the positivity. There's a long way to go but the pressing was also improved. The defence helped the midfield and the midfield helped the attack. A marked improvement.",
      "The need for additions is still obvious but perhaps fans may get to see a little more of what Amorim wants to do.",
      "Depending on where Amorim sees Mazraoui and Shaw, United's back three of Yoro, De Ligt, and Heaven, is about as strong as it comes. It may well be the back three that starts against Arsenal in three weeks' time.",
      "De Ligt played in the anchor role at the back, mopping up scraggly chances and loose balls. And beside the Dutchman he had Yoro on the right and Heaven on the left. While not perfect, the performance of the three was solid. If a little untidy at times, it did its job in the main.",
      "The worry for Amorim should be that this was against a pretty lifeless West Ham attack. The prospect of those three facing Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli is a little unnerving.",
      "While still raw, the talent in Yoro is clear. He needs more time. Heaven is even younger and Bowen's goal is a prime example that he has much to learn in anticipation and shutting down attackers.",
      "Does the back three have potential? Yes. Is it a top four defence? No. Far from it.",
      "It's worth remembering that Hojlund is only 22 years of age. And despite his form last season there's never a United side that should have relied upon him as their out-and-out goalscorer. That notwithstanding, it was him or Joshua Zirkzee. Zirkzee is not a striker, he's a false nine or a 10 who, at times, had United fans licking their lips with his quick feet and link-up play.",
      "So that leaves Hojlund. After a mere two minutes he showed his three best attributes - speed, strength and mentality. After Cunha won the ball on the edge of the box, Hojlund found himself on the break one v one with West Ham defender Max Kilman. Hojlund outmuscled him, sprinted past him and found himself with an opportunity on goal.",
      "That's where his weakest attribute came in - finishing. The shot was fierce and smashed off the left upright. It was a good chance he carved out for himself but he couldn't apply the finishing touch.",
      "Only moments later he found himself with the ball at his feet in the penalty area. The result was a ballooned shot over the bar. It's always a snatched shot or a power strike rather than a caressed finish for Hojlund. There's no doubting his determination to chase down every ball but that's not enough.",
      "At times last season the Dane was left frustrated by Alejandro Garnacho's selfishness. But with Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha he can expect a lot more service this time around. However, Amorim will need decide quick if he gambles on his goals coming from his two new signings via Zirkzee or from a hit or miss Hojlund.",
      "Amorim has never quite figured out where he wants to play Fernandes. In part, that's due to him being so good the United boss probably wishes he could play him in five positions.",
      "But Amorim did make a mistake in the Europa League final dropping Fernandes deep. Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro had established a semi-solid partnership through the previous European games. The captain replacing Ugarte left not only a hole in attack but created an inability to stop Spurs running through the midfield.",
      "Casemiro's age and Ugarte's legs have left a lot to be desired and it is why United are crying out for a defensive midfielder. It is therefore interesting that Fernandes started in one of the No. 10 positions against West Ham. He was instrumental in several transitions of attack, linking up with Cunha a little better than he did with Hojlund.",
      "His cross ultimately led to Areola's blunder which the penalty came from and it was of course he who slotted neatly from the penalty spot. Like usual, he had no problem bossing his teammates about but it felt a little more commanding coming from an attacking position.",
      "And because he was further forward he was also in a position to delicately curl one past Areola for United's second.",
      "And because Fernandes was further forward it meant Kobbie Mainoo partnered Ugarte in midfield. While at times the common vulnerability of teams running through the pair did show, like when Tomas Soucek had too much room to slot in Bowen, there was still some promise.",
      "Prior to kick-off Amorim declared that he has \"Big plans\" for Mainoo while lauding his talent. And it was on this very pitch two years ago that Mainoo's performance against Arsenal in pre-season caught the eye. It's fitting that he once again purred on the ball.",
      "His silky footwork and confidence on the ball drew \"Oohs\" and \"Aahs\" from the crowd. But perhaps what Amorim will be most pleased with was his doggedness to win the ball. Mainoo raced onto Areola's poor goalkick to intercept the ball in the second half. He quickly fed it to Fernandes who produced a sumptuous finish.",
      "His partner, Ugarte, flattered to deceive last season but did show a side to his play not many have seen. The Uruguayan quickly won the ball back after Mainoo ran into a Claret wall. He proceeded to nutmeg one player before feeding through Amad who neatly slotted away his chance. Unfortunately for the pair it was offside.",
      "It's not rock solid, as Bowen's goal showed, but it was better than last season.",

      "Shearer has also been quick to point out that Mbeumo, one of their major recruits, will leave midseason to take part in the Africa Cup of Nations. That will place more pressure on United's depth.",
      "He said: \"Mbuemo will likely be going to AFCON, but you know that when you sign these players. You just have to get on with it and accept it. He'll be a big player for Man United so to be without him for that amount of time will hurt him and Man United but other clubs will have the same problem.\"",
      "United have reportedly had a loan offer for Emi Martinez turned down. Aston Villa have also made it clear that Ollie Watkins is not for sale. Earlier in the summer Liam Delap, who was on the club's radar, picked a move to Chelsea ahead of a switch to Manchester.",

      "Manchester United take on West Ham on Sunday as the two Premier League sides look to ready themselves for the new season. Ruben Amorim has been incredibly busy this summer with regards to enhancing the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag in November, welcoming a host of fresh faces to Old Trafford.",
      "United struck a deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha as the early window opened in June in a £59.5million move, before finally sealing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo after negotiations with Brentford dragged out for the best part of a month. In the end, the two sides agreed a fee which could reach as high as £71m including add-ons, as the Cameroon international looks to hit the ground running in the north west.",
      "It comes after United suffered a sub-par 16th-place finish in the Premier League last season, and fans will hope for a better showing in 2025/26 given that Amorim has received the backing of the board and a full pre-season campaign. West Ham, meanwhile, finished 14th last time around, and will hope to start the season strongly when they kick off their Premier League campaign against newly-promoted Sunderland next month.",
      "Graham Potter has also been active during thetransfer window, welcoming Kyle Walker-Peters from Southampton on a free, as well as acquiring El Hadji Malick Diouf from Slavia Prague for £19m and Jean-Clair Todibo from Nice in a £32.8m move after a successful loan spell.",
      "Manchester United's pre-season clash with West Ham is a part of the Premier League Summer Series mini-tournament which is taking place in the USA this weekend, with Bournemouth and Everton also taking part. As a result, the Red Devils will meet the Hammers at the 82,500-capacity MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which is home to the New York Giants and the New York Jets of the NFL.",
      "Unfortunately for UK-based fans keen on watching the game live, it will be a late one. That's because the game is set to take place at 7pm local time in New Jersey, which is 12am Sunday in the UK.",
      "It's not the only late game of the tournament either, with Everton's clash with Bournemouth having taken place at 9pm, also on Saturday. West Ham's game with Everton on Wednesday gets underway at 11.30pm, and United's clash with Bournemouth starts at 2.30am UK time on Thursday.",
      "Meanwhile, NOW TV passes can be used to watch the game.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim is wasting no time in ensuring last season's worst-ever Premier League campaign for Manchester United was a one-off.",
      "Amorim has been up at 6am on United's pre-season tour of the US, wasting no time and using every minute to plan with his coaching staff ahead of the new campaign.",
      "The United head coach is relishing a first full pre-season with his squad, having wanted to wait until this summer to take over, but being forced to take over midway through last term.",
      "Taking charge midway through a season is never ideal, not least when Amorim changed United's system from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3, a radical departure from what the players were used to. United's players struggled to get to grips with the new formation, the upshot a 15th-placed finish, the club's worst position for 51 years, while they also missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "But the doom and gloom of last season has been replaced by a tangible air of optimism and excitement among the United squad and management during the first week of their three-game US tour.",
      "Amorim has left behind those players who want out of United and who could spread a negative influence within the US tour party, namely Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia. Marcus Rashford, who fell out with Amorim within weeks of the new manager's arrival, has begun a new chapter at Barcelona, and only players fully committed to the team are present in the US.",
      "Amorim underlined that message ahead of United's tour opener, against Premier League rivals West Ham, in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, where next year's World Cup final will be held. The United boss stressed the importance of his first pre-season in terms of building a bond with his players, for them to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The connection between £133.5million duo Cunha and Mbeumo will be crucial as Amorim looks to solve United's goal scoring problems, his side having only managed to find the net 44 times in the league last season.",
      "Amorim still wants to recruit a new No.9 to lead United's attack, but knows that in Cunha and Mbeumo, he has two players with a proven ability to score in the league, the pair netting 15 and 20 goals respectively last season.",
      "“They can both play as a striker,” said Amorim. “But we also have Josh [Zirkzee], we have Rasmus [Hojlund], so our focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work and they have other players who are fighting for that position.",
      "“But again, I'm really pleased, because they proved that the qualities that they have, they are really humble, which is really important, and the best thing is that they chose to be here. In our club at the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player. So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy, because all the players who are here want to be here - that for me is the most important thing.",
      "“With Matheus and Brian - also Diego, but Diego is a different situation because he's a potential player. But with Matheus and Bryan, we are clearly a better team.”",

      "A move for Benjamin Sesko to Manchester United appears unlikely - at least if the striker's past comments are anything to go by. United have been searching for a new centre forward all summer, but have so far failed to secure a suitable signing.",
      "They missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool, while efforts to land Victor Osimhen and Ollie Watkins have also come up short. As a result, they've turned their attention to Sesko - who was previously in talks to join Arsenal before negotiations stalled and the Gunners pivoted to Gyokeres instead.",
      "RB Leipzig are believed to have lowered their asking price for Sesko, with the Slovenian striker now available for around £60million, according to BILD. However, any hopes United have of securing his signature may depend on whether Sesko has softened his stance on the club.",
      "United made an approach for him in 2023 following his breakout season at Red Bull Salzburg, where he netted 18 goals in all competitions and attracted interest from several top European sides. In the end, Sesko opted for a move to Leipzig - and later hinted that United's style of play had been a key factor in his decision to turn down a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "\"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations [about which club I would sign for]. But I think it was better to come [to RB Leipzig],\" he admitted in 2024.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "After missing out on Sesko, the Red Devils turned to another highly rated but similarly unproven talent in Rasmus Hojlund, spending £72m on the young Dane. Two years on, however, the career trajectories of the two strikers have diverged significantly.",
      "Sesko has gone from strength to strength, scoring 18 and then 21 goals in successive seasons for RB Leipzig. Hojlund, on the other hand, has struggled to find his footing.",
      "After being thrown into a faltering United side, he has battled inconsistency and a lack of goals, and now appears likely to leave the club with his reputation diminished. Hojlund's struggles suggest Sesko was right to pick Leipzig - a club where he could hone his skills and develop without the weight of expectation that comes with leading the line for a Premier League colossal like United.",
      "Ironically, two years later, Sesko may yet make the move he once rejected. United's head of scouting, Christopher Vivell, is a known admirer and has personally watched the Slovenian striker in action.",
      "The 22-year-old could become the focal point of United's new-look front line, joining recent arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to form a revamped attacking trio. The club have already splashed £133m this summer, and signing Sesko would take their total outlay close to £200m.",
      "But with Marcus Rashford being shipped off to Barcelona and Hojlund heavily linked with an exit, reinforcements up front aren't just a priority - they're a necessity.",
      "Sesko is not agitating for a move, and with his contract running until 2029, Leipzig are under no immediate pressure to sell. However, it's understood that if their £60m valuation is met, they would be open to letting him speak with interested clubs.",
      "The fee could represent a relative bargain in today's market, but United had the chance to sign him for a fraction of that price just a few years ago. Back in 2021, then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer recommended the club move for the then-18-year-old, who was available for just £2.5m. United declined, viewing the deal as too risky.",

      "Ed Woodward believed that Manchester United's 2015 acquisition of Bastian Schweinsteiger would \"send shivers down the spines of rivals,\" only for the player to turn out to be a sensational flop. Woodward joined the board of directors of Old Trafford as an executive vice-chairman in 2012, before assuming David Gill's role of CEO the following year.",
      "And while the now 53-year-old aimed to hit the ground running with regards to welcoming fresh faces to the Red Devils squad, many of his transfers completely missed the mark. For instance, Woodward was at the helm when Paul Pogba' returned to United from Juventus in August 2016 in a mammoth deal.",
      "Of course, Pogba came through the youth system at United in 2011 before joining the Serie A stalwarts for a reported £1.5million the following year. But four years later, realising the error of their ways, the Red Devils board opted to bring him back to Old Trafford for a then-world-record fee of £89m.",
      "However, Pogba then returned to Juventus once more in 2022 on a free transfer, failing to recuperate even a fraction of the fee that they had spent bringing their academy graduate back to the northwest of England six years earlier. Pogba was just one of many expensive signings during Woodward's time at the club that failed to live up to expectations.",
      "Woodward was also at the helm when Schweinsteiger arrived from Bayern Munich in a £6.5m deal back in 2015, a move which on paper looked like a steal for the 13-time Premier League winners.",
      "After progressing through the Bavarian youth system in 2002, Schweinsteiger spent 13 years with Bayern, lifting eight Bundesliga titles, nine domestic cups and a Champions League. He also managed 121 caps for Germany and lifted the 2014 World Cup, before being named team captain following Philipp Lahm's retirement from international football.",
      "Given his wealth of experience at the highest levels, Woodward went as far as claiming that Schweinsteiger would leave rivals quaking in their boots when coming up against the midfield maestro shortly after his arrival in England. He was quoted as saying at the time: \"It’s fantastic to see a player like that come to Manchester United.",
      "\"He’s our first ever German, and what a German – he’s won absolutely everything and comes here with fantastic experience. When people see Bastian on the team sheet, that’s going to send some shivers down the spine.\"",
      "However, the reality is that Woodward may have set unreasonable expectations on the star, given how his tenure with the Premier League giants actually played out. During his maiden season with United, Schweinsteiger spent more than 130 days sidelined through injury.",
      "And when Jose Mourinho took the reins of the club from Louis van Gaal in the spring of 2016, he made it clear that Schweinsteiger was not part of his plans going forward, demoting the player to training with the U23 set-up in a move he faced heavy criticism for and that he has since admitted was a big mistake.",
      "Schweinsteiger played for United just 35 times over the course of his two-year stint with the club before he moved on to MLS outfit Chicago Fire in 2017. There, he scored eight goals and created 11 assists in 92 outings before retiring in 2019.",
      "Woodward, meanwhile, announced in 2021 that he would be resigning from his position at Manchester United. He parted ways with the club on February 1, 2022, but has since returned to work, having been appointed to the board of trustees for Bloomsbury Football Foundation last year.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Villa, who lost Jhon Duran back in January, have made it known that they have no interest in selling their forward despite interest from those on the red half of Manchester. Watkins will hope to return to the club's first choice striker after a difficult few months to end the season.",
      "Ironically it was the loan arrival of Marcus Rashford from United that saw Watkins' playing time suffer as a result. Rashford has since left and joined Barcelona on loan, but it means Watkins will face less competition as things stand.",

I was fuming I wasn't playing and I let him know that.\"",

      "“So I'm very comfortable to be here, I'm very comfortable with the pressure right now, and I hope everything can be better too - don't think about the bad times.”",

I think my first top was a Manchester United top with Ronaldo behind. It’s just such a big club and, yeah, I’m really happy to be here.”",
      "Mbeumo says he idolised Ronaldo and Lionel Messi growing up, as well as admiring Neymar and Eden Hazard, and joins Cunha in bolstering what has been a blunt United attack. The forward says the Brazil international will “bring something new” to a team that he is excited to get to know better when they head to the United States for their pre-season tour on Tuesday.",

      "Ruben Amorim has maintained if he starts the season with his current squad he would \"be happy\" and told the Manchester United hierarchy \"to be careful\" before the sign any more players this summer.",
      "The Portuguese boss has only seen two new faces arrive in recent months - Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Otherwise he is left with the team that finished 15th in the Premier League last term - an all time low for the Red Devils.",
      "Amorim has been unable to land the striker it was reported he wants whilst he is yet to sign any specialist wing-backs, which will aid his system. The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss though has been given the opportunity to work consistently on the training ground, which he wasn't afforded throughout last season.",
      "But in an effort to close the gap on the country's leading sides United have been expected to sign more than two new player, yet Amorim maintains he is happy with what he's got.",
      "He said during the club's pre-season tour: \"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player. If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "The club recently wrapped up a deal for Mbeumo after negotiating with Brentford for weeks, before their third bid was finally accepted. Earlier in the summer they were able to land Cunha, owing to a release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "United have fallen foul in the past of signing players who have not produced. Amorim is clearly keen to avoid a repeat but believes the group he currently has have developed an understanding. He claimed: \"You feel the bond between the players in the best teams. We remind ourself how special it is to be at the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer but that feeling of bonding is really important. The spirit is positive.\"",
      "As things stand United will have to stick with Rasmus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee as their frontman, unless Amorim does chose to play with Cunha or Mbeumo centrally.",
      "Deals have been explored for the likes of Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, but the Manchester outfit were quickly told that the England international was not for sale. PSG's Randal Kolo Muani and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic were also considered according to ESPN.",
      "Despite Alexander Isak expressing a desire to look for a move away from Newcastle those at Old Trafford have not considered joining the race for the Swedish star.",
      "Any new arrivals may require United to first sell one or more of their players. Currently there are a number of individuals who face uncertain futures in Manchester and are seeking the exit door. Marcus Rashford was able to secure himself a loan move to Barcelona this week.",
      "Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho are also open to leaving the club but Amorim claimed unless their valuations are met they will remain with United for the foreseeable.",
      "He said: \"Some players have to move to make space in the team, others want a new challenge. We are giving them time to think and if they reach a point where they have to join the team they will.",
      "\"Omar and Jason have a number for these players, if that isn't reached they will be United players. I am ready to receive the players. I have more options and if they have to fight each other to play that is perfect.\"",

      "“There are different reasons for the players [left behind],” said Amorim. “Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams.",

      "A week on, another Portuguese-speaker played a pass for Rasmus Hojlund and the ball eluded him. This time the reaction was different.",
      "Hojlund offered Matheus Cunha applause for his overhit forward pass moments before half-time. Cunha cursed his execution, particularly as he had engineered space with a deft turn that wowed the crowd in New Jersey.",
      "In Stockholm a week earlier, Hojlund vented at Diogo Dalot for delaying a pass. Within a minute of kick-off in New Jersey, he was played through by Cunha and smacked the post.",
      "With Cunha and Bruno Fernandes to support Hojlund, he was unlikely to be short of service. United were productive and the 1-0 half-time scoreline flattered West Ham. The issue was the goal was a fifth-minute penalty and United's chance-conversion from open play was familiarly poor.",
      "Hojlund had two shots, Leny Yoro nodded wide and Fernandes hit goalkeeper Alphonse Areola when he seemed certain to hit the back of the net. Fernandes rectified that quickly with a classy second in the 52nd minute.",
      "This was hardly a case of Fernandes papering over the cracks again. United were so energetic their starting XI played for over an hour, unheard of for their first pre-season tour match.",
      "After the rotational team that was fielded against Leeds United in Sweden, Ruben Amorim used his maiden tour match to set out his stall now the players have banked nearly three weeks of training. The starters played for 65 minutes, a striking shift from the opening tour games under Erik ten Hag when players were allocated 45 minutes.",
      "Amorim's first tour XI could feasibly line up against Arsenal in three weeks. Bryan Mbeumo, deemed not match-fit due to his arrival time from Brentford, will doubtless muscle his way in and Andre Onana is hopeful of recovering in time for the competitive schedule.",
      "It was a travesty the scoreline was 2-1 when United's first XI earned a breather midway through the second half. Amorim picked six players bought over the last year, supplemented by integral players for the long-term. United had a newish look even with only one new signing.",
      "The glaring issue in the team remains the striker. Hojlund's desperation for a goal was evident from his edgy body language and he headed off the pitch without a goal to his name for the second successive week.",
      "After two early sighters, Hojlund was on the fringes and United fans were treated to the familiar sight of Fernandes placing the ball between the sticks. It is early days but United cannot get by another season with Fernandes topping the goalscoring charts.",
      "Hojlund scored nine minutes into last season's Stateside tour before he hit the deck with a hamstring injury against Arsenal. A sliding doors moment before the season began. This was another. He was almost on the scoresheet inside a minute.",
      "Running onto Cunha's through ball, Hojlund effortlessly outpaced Max Kilman and thudded the upright with a first-time shot. United only had to wait a few more minutes to change the scoreboard through Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes and Cunha warmed up with each other. United lack quantity and quality in midfield, an area where Fernandes could paper over the cracks. Yet Amorim indicated at his pre-match press conference that he was loath to permanently relocate Fernandes to a deeper role, having admitted that the captain is developing a \"connection\" with Cunha.",
      "Whether as a duo behind the striker or one in front of the other, there is a growing rapport between the two Latinos just two starts into Cunha's career at United. But Mbeumo has to be accommodated somewhere.",
      "Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, the two teenagers in the team, are developing into attacking assets from defence. Heaven won the penalty and Yoro found Fernandes with a pass from inside his own third. Heaven erred when he failed to close down Jarrod Bowen and the angle for West Ham's goal.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was the talk of the town as a teenager at the MetLife two years ago when United beat Arsenal. He was starting again, this time to regain his place rather than gain it.",
      "Having been trialled as a playmaker by Amorim and, fruitlessly, as a false nine, Mainoo was back in central midfield with Manuel Ugarte, a certain starter next month on the basis of United's substantial investment in the Uruguayan. A day after Amorim admitted he is pushing Mainoo to increase his rhythm and pace, Mainoo assisted Fernandes by winning the ball deep inside West Ham territory.",
      "Ugarte reserved his best United performance this calendar year for a friendly and the challenge will be for him to transmit this level to a meaningful match. Ugarte's intensity would have befitted a Premier League match.",
      "Diogo Dalot has had a squad number upgrade to '2' yet Amad is poised to occupy the right wing in this United reboot. The 23-year-old had a goal chalked off after he strayed offside.",
      "It was another Portuguese-speaker who got on the scoresheet.",

      "United will end their visit to the States against Everton at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on August 3.",
      "Brentford's pre-season started a week later than United's and Mbeumo is not deemed match-fit, so the club are carefully handling the £65million signing ahead of the new season.",
      "Mbeumo still took part in a cool-down on the pitch after United's 2-1 victory against West Ham.",
      "When United return from the US, they will welcome Fiorentina to Old Trafford on August 9 for their final pre-season friendly before playing Arsenal in their opening game of the Premier League season eight days later.",

      "Manchester United made a winning start to their pre-season tour of the United States with a 2-1 win over West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.",
      "United scooped all three points in their opening game of the Premier League Summer Series via a brace from captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The United ace scored either side of half-time to put United into a deserved two-goal lead, before Jarrod Bowen halved the deficit with a strong finish with just under half an hour left to play.",
      "Fernandes put United in front with just five minutes on the clock, slotting home a penalty, before doubling their lead shortly after half-time with an excellent finish.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim will have been able to take plenty of positives from the game, with United's collective performance offering plenty of encouragement. There was also a series of bright individual showings.",
      "Next up for the Reds in the Premier League Summer Series is a clash with Bournemouth in Chicago in midweek.",
      "We're calling time on our coverage of United's 2-1 win over West Ham here, folks. Thank you to all of you who have tuned in throughout the night.",
      "We will have plenty more reaction and analysis available for you on the MEN website, plus even more tour-related content.",

      "United made a winning start to their pre-season tour with a 2-1 win over West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was the star of the show, netting a brace to ensure the Reds took all three points from their Premier League Summer Series opener.",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Unconvincingly punched a cross away but gathered Tomas Soucek's late first-half chance. Well beaten by Bowen. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Played a superb long-distance pass for Fernandes and again showed why he can be an attacking asset with his distribution. 8",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",

      "It's all over at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and United have made a winning start to their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "A Bruno Fernandes brace got the job done for the Reds. He scored either side of half-time ahead of Jarrod Bowen pulling one back for West Ham.",
      "Almost a second for Bowen, who tests Bayindir with a rasping drive on his stronger left foot.",
      "There will be a minimum of five additional minutes at the end of this second half.",
      "Unsurprisingly, the game has not had as good a tempo since both managers made a collection of changes.",
      "As I write that, Guilherme blazes an effort over the bar for West Ham from a tight angle.",
      "West Ham boss Graham Potter is making four more changes with just over ten minutes left to play.",
      "There are now just 20 minutes left at the MetLife Stadium. United still lead 2-1 after Bruno Fernandes' brace.",
      "Meanwhile, following his exit a few minutes ago, Harry Maguire now has the captain's armband.",
      "Amorim has made the changes slightly earlier than planned, taking off ten of the 11 starters. Bayindir is the only one to have stayed on from the start.",
      "This is now United's XI: Bayindir; Fredricson, Maguire, Shaw; Dalot, Collyer, Casemiro, Leon; Mount, J. Fletcher; Obi.",
      "That's not good from Heaven. He's far too casual when the ball gets to Bowen when he should be on him swiftly to close him down and close the angle. He practically invites him to shoot and Bowen is a consistent Premier League scorer. It was a fine strike.",
      "West Ham get a goal back via Bowen. He beats Heaven too easily and fires a powerful strike past Bayindir from the right channel of the penalty area.",
      "That was a good chance for West Ham to get themselves back into the game via Bowen. He meets a pass into the box with a first-time effort and curls it over the top.",
      "Ahead of Fernandes scoring United's second, I was just typing how much I think United fans are going to enjoy watching Cunha.",
      "The Brazilian, who has regularly linked up with Fernandes tonight, has been really bright. His running power and ability to move the ball is really impressive.",
      "He already looks like a good signing.",
      "That is sublime from Fernandes! He gets a pass from Mainoo at the edge of the 'D' and he just clips the ball into the top corner. Areola had no chance. That was superb from the United captain.",
      "United should be 2-0 up. Fernandes capitalises on some slack West Ham defending, gets clear but gets the ball stuck under his foot and his tame shot was easy for Areola.",
      "The second half is underway at the MetLife Stadium. Ruben Amorim has not made any changes at the break, nor has West Ham boss Graham Potter.",
      "United haven't got any substitutes warming up at the pause, which was a clear signal there would not be wholesale changes after 45 minutes. There were when they played here two years ago but the fact the starters are scheduled to play 70 minutes would indicate they are fitter and more robust than they were on previous tours. It's certainly a question worth asking Amorim afterwards.",
      "Bayindir",
      "Unconvincing punch and saved late on from Soucek. 6",
      "Yoro",
      "Fine pass for Fernandes and could have scored. 8",

      "Solid. 7",

      "Hojlund",
      "Started encouragingly and hit the post. 6",
      "The half-time whistle goes at the MetLife Stadium and United lead 1-0 at the interval after an early penalty from Bruno Fernandes.",
      "You can tell from Hojlund's body language he is eager for that final pass. United have tried to find him a couple of times in the last few minutes and the pace of the pass hasn't been right.",
      "He is understandably desperate for a goal and has had two decent chances but they were a while ago in this half.",
      "There will be three added minutes at the end of this first half.",
      "A West Ham corner from Ward-Prowse comes in from the right, it finds the head of Soucek, whose tame header is easy for Bayindir to claim.",
      "It's a shame Amad drifted offside with his run because United deserve a two-goal cushion after a really comfortable first half. Ugarte did brilliantly to win the ball there, although he probably could have played the pass sooner to Amad.",
      "United have looked impressively organised in this first half, which bodes well for the new campaign.",
      "Amad puts the ball in the back of the net, finishing off a superb move, but the offside flag goes up.",
      "Cunha has had a good half. He has a good turn of pace on the ball and is busy off it. You could see him and Fernandes clicking in this team, even when Fernandes is playing deep, and they've been in their element out there.",
      "One issue with United this half is they have only scored one goal and that was a penalty. They have had good opportunities from open play.",
      "United look very settled. There's worthy continuity from last season (despite the overall performance) with three of the summer signings last summer in the line-up supplemented by the two winter window arrivals, some other key long-term players and newbie Cunha.",
      "It's a relatively newish United team even though there is just the one summer signing in it from the current transfer window.",
      "Fernandes takes aim from about 25 yards, clearly confident after scoring earlier, but his shot goes over the bar.",
      "United have not been afraid to shoot in these opening 30 minutes.",
      "That's a really good recovery run from Amad. United could end up shifting four wingers this summer, partly as none of them are capable of, or want to track back and Amad is the exception. You saw that in Amorim's first match in charge at Ipswich and the way United are shaping up, he will be playing on the right wing.",
      "Hojlund struck the woodwork in the first few minutes and has fired over with another chance, but he's made a bright start and is working hard. The 22-year-old is running the channels well and giving West Ham's defenders something to think about.",
      "Winning second balls is crucial in Amorim's system and Hojlund is putting himself about."

      "For those of you who stayed up overnight to watch it, you were rewarded, as the Reds continued their unbeaten start to pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Premier League Series. Captain Bruno Fernandes scored a brace before Jarrod Bowen pegged one back for Graham Potter's men at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.",
      "These matches are often less about the result but the minutes in the legs and Ruben Amorim will undoubtedly be pleased to see new signing Matheus Cunha perform so well in the US. Of course, our main focus today will be transfers and one rumour which caught fire on Saturday is that of a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "PSG's Italian goalkeeper has reportedly rejected a new contract offer and negotiations have stalled as he enters the final year of his deal. Meanwhile, the hunt for a new striker is well underway with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins both linked with the Reds.",
      "Take a look at all the United transfer news and views as we get it below.",

      "On Saturday, Kobbie Mainoo returned to the stadium where he announced himself to the world.",
      "Mainoo was just 18 when he started against Arsenal at the MetLife Stadium in July 2023, and that summer preceded an outstanding breakout campaign for the Stockport-born midfielder.",
      "During that tour of the United States, it was obvious Manchester United had a supremely talented young player on their hands. Mainoo looked unfazed playing in front of 82,500 fans and his laid-back nature endeared him to Erik ten Hag, who had no qualms about playing him in the Premier League.",
      "Mainoo was rewarded with a place at Euro 2024 for his performances during his first full season, but his second year as a first-team player didn't go as planned and the new campaign feels big for him.",
      "The 20-year-old has not consolidated himself in Ruben Amorim's preferred starting XI, partly because of injuries and partly because Amorim doesn't seem to know his best position.",
      "Mainoo has played as a No.10, a striker and in deeper midfield in Amorim's system. That hasn't been conducive to Mainoo showing his best form, but Amorim appears to be close to settling on his role this summer.",
      "The youngster came on from the bench against Leeds in Stockholm to play in the pivot and subsequently started in that role against West Ham. Mainoo was excellent against Arsenal at MetLife Stadium in 2023 and was hoping to deliver a similar display at the scene where the world recognised his potential.",
      "Some believe Mainoo does not possess the athleticism to operate in central midfield, but there were promising signs against Leeds and further positives to build on against the Hammers.",
      "Mainoo's range of passing isn't utilised when he plays as a No.10. However, when he starts in the deeper role, he can play like an NFL quarterback, orchestrating play and picking passes to start attacks.",
      "Amorim needs to settle on a role for Mainoo because it's impossible for him to find his rhythm when his position is changed each week, and the 40-year-old has admitted Mainoo needs to be close to the ball.",
      "Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: \"I think he can play in both positions, in the midfield. Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball.",
      "\"I think he is a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. I think he needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I'm always on top of that with Kobbie, because he is so good sometimes but he can be better. So I have big plans. But again, like I said, one game per week, the competition is going to be huge.\"",
      "Amorim made wholesale changes on the 65-minute mark and Mainoo was brought off. It's fair to say he didn't dazzle as he did against Arsenal 24 months ago, but that performance was a high benchmark.",
      "The question is whether Mainoo can be as effective in Amorim's system as he was when Ten Hag was in charge. Amorim is trying to fit Mainoo into his plans because he is too talented to leave on the bench.",
      "The remaining pre-season fixtures will provide further clues on Amorim's thinking, but it seems he is leaning towards the conclusion that Mainoo is best suited to playing in midfield.",
      "Provided Amorim can get the best out of Mainoo, he could be like a new signing.",

      "Mainoo lined up in midfield with Manuel Ugarte for United's opening tour match in New Jersey and regained the ball to assist Bruno Fernandes for United's winning goal in the 55th minute.",
      "Amorim played Mainoo as a playmaker and trialled him up front in the 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in February but the 20-year-old could return to central midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The United head coach admitted on Friday he is urging Mainoo to improve his \"rhythm and pace\" and the England international was restored to the starting XI, having been picked on the bench against Leeds United in Stockholm last week.",
      "Fernandes got both of United's goals against West Ham, having rejected an offer from a Saudi Pro League club to leave in the summer. It was while discussing his impact on the team that Amorim enthused about Mainoo's performance.",
      "\"You can see it in the assists, the goals,\" Amorim said of Fernandes. \"Not just that. I think now he has more players. I felt that in the tour. I felt that now there are more players to help them to lead the group. That is a good thing.",
      "\"But he's our leader, so it's really important. Not just on the field, but also off the field. He lives by example. He works really hard. Always available. Sometimes he plays with pain.",
      "\"The problem is sometimes he gets frustrated and sometimes he loses a little bit the focus of his job. Sometimes he wants to help so much his teammates that sometimes it's not the best thing to do.",
      "\"They have to learn. They have to do their job. Bruno has to wait for the ball in different situations. This kind of thing is a leader, but he needs help. And he's going to have help.",
      "\"He has a function or a position for every game. It's impossible to play all the positions. Last year I felt that sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and then we missed Bruno near the box. I think with different characteristics, with Cunha, with Bryan, I really like Kobbie's game. I think he (Fernandes) will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot. Maybe in the sprint he's a different player, but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance. He's smart. So it's not about that.",
      "\"I spoke about that against Leeds because I felt like everybody in the midfield, the pace was not there. Today it was there. Manuel and Kobbie did that job.",
      "\"The physicality of Bruno is not the concern. He's ready for the physicality, playing deep or as a midfielder.\"",

      "Ugarte's poor form towards the end of the season cost him a place in the Europa League final starting XI and Amorim played Casemiro ahead of the Uruguayan. Casemiro, 33, is out of contract next year and United's substantial investment in Ugarte has to pay off under Amorim.",
      "Amorim coached the 24-year-old Uruguayan at Sporting before he joined PSG and he is optimistic Ugarte will have a more fulfilling campaign with United in 2025-26.",
      "\"First thing is adaptation to a new team, a new country,\" Amorim explained. \"Sometimes we just look inside the pitch, off the pitch. You have some troubles sometimes. He (Ugarte)'s more adapted. Then I think he needs more confidence. That is also my job.",
      "\"If you look last year, if you take Bruno (Fernandes), that is always confident. If you look at the team, the performance, if the team doesn't perform well, all the players, individual, are going to suffer.",
      "\"You can see today, when they are confident and they play, it seems like everybody can touch the ball and have confidence. It's more a team thing than individual.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund struck the post inside the first minute and had another chance which he fired wide. The Dane is currently United's only available senior striker with Joshua Zirkzee recovering from a minor injury but it is widely known the club want a new goalscorer.",
      "\"I really like the Rasmus game,\" Amorim enthused. \"The runs, the way he fought during the game. One against one, when we kick the ball, he connects with the teammates. He did a great job.\"",

      "Manchester United won 2-1 against West Ham in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United started their pre-season tour of the United States by facing West Ham at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, and Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring in the opening five minutes.",
      "Fernandes converted a penalty and netted again in the second half. West Ham responded through Jarrod Bowen, but they lacked quality in the final third and were unable to produce an equaliser.",
      "United will take on Bournemouth next before ending their tour against Everton. Here are five talking points from the West Ham victory.",
      "Fernandes is the main man",
      "United have splashed £127.5million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but it could be argued their best piece of business will be retaining Fernandes after interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Hilal were in contact with Fernandes' representative about a move to Saudi Arabia. The midfielder considered the proposal and his future at Old Trafford was in doubt, but he decided to stay at United.",
      "Keeping Fernandes was imperative and he was the main man again on Saturday, scoring twice against West Ham.",
      "The second goal was a world-class strike - Fernandes' technique around the box is outstanding - and it was another example of the 30-year-old providing the goods to secure a victory.",
      "The system looks better",
      "Amorim failed to oversee improvement following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon and some pundits suggested he needed to abandon his philosophy to secure results last season.",
      "United were hopeless, but Amorim did the right thing by sticking by his formation. He should (theoretically) reap the rewards in the new campaign because the players have already spent six months learning its tactics.",
      "The game was 1-0 at half-time against West Ham, but the scoreline did not reflect how comfortable United had been.",
      "Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven are a superb combination for orchestrating build-up play, and they are now seeing patterns unfold ahead of them when they look to play a pass.",
      "United's pressing of the opponent was also notably better. United looked fitter than West Ham and they forced them to surrender possession on a handful of occasions.",
      "The latest on Mainoo",
      "Amorim discussed Kobbie Mainoo in his pre-match press conference, touching on his position in his system and his expectations for the youngster. Mainoo suffered with injuries last season and wasn't helped by the tweaking of his role, which made it difficult for him to find his groove in a new formation.",
      "The No.10 experiment had merit, but the evidence towards the end of the season suggested Mainoo should be relocated deeper in midfield and Amorim seems to have come to the same conclusion.",
      "Mainoo came on from the bench to play in the pivot against Leeds in Stockholm and he started in that role against West Ham, hinting Amorim might have finally decided on his position.",
      "Amad at right wing-back",
      "There has also been a discussion about which role Amad will predominantly feature in, given he can effectively operate as a right wing-back and in the right-sided No.10 role.",
      "Mbeumo, who was absent against West Ham due to fitness, is expected to play on the right side of the attack and Mason Mount can play there, so there is strong competition.",
      "Amorim wants competition for places and it's certainly a good headache to have, although Amad's importance in the dressing room soared last term and most fans would have him in their strongest XI.",
      "Amad started at wing-back again and it will be fascinating to see whether Amorim believes that can be his permanent role.",
      "Avram Glazer shows his face",
      "Avram Glazer last attended a match at Old Trafford against Fulham on the opening day of last season. The 64-year-old has deliberately made limited visits to Manchester and has been a more regular attendee at Wembley.",
      "He was unlikely to face a hostile reception in his homeland, though, and it was no surprise to see him attend the MetLife Stadium to watch United's game against West Ham.",
      "United fans are planning another anti-Glazer protest before facing Arsenal on August 17, so it's unlikely Avram Glazer will attend the opening Premier League game for a successive season.",

      "Cunha has impressed in training, but he has also endeared himself to his new teammates.",
      "Speaking before facing West Ham in New Jersey, Ruben Amorim said he \"loves\" Cunha because he has been loud in the dressing room, and Fernandes agreed with that assessment.",
      "\"We know the Brazilians are very loud and very happy, so he's one of them,\" Fernandes told CBS.",

      "\"That is very good because we need him at this pace, to create a connection with every player to get the best out of him, but also from the team.\"",
      "Fernandes opened the scoring by converting from the spot in the first few minutes of the match and netted his brace with an outstanding strike in the 52nd minute.",
      "\"I felt good, the training sessions have been very, very good,\" added Fernandes. \"We have been doing very well, obviously they have been tough ones, but it's to prepare us for this kind of game.",
      "\"It's good to win the game, even with it being a friendly, we want to win every game to prepare ourselves in the best way and go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall, the game was good. I think we were very good on the ball and in some moments we could have done longer possessions, as the manager was asking us.",
      "\"We rushed a little bit in the final third to get our chances, to get our goals, so we have to work on that, but I think overall it was a very good game for us.\"",

      "Played in sweltering conditions at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, United were good value for their victory, producing a performance that featured plenty of positives.",
      "United were dominant in the first half and were unlucky to go into the half-time break with just a one-goal lead to show for their efforts. They got on the front foot from the first whistle, playing with a sense of energy and determination.",
      "And in the opinion of De Ligt, United's intensity levels will be key to their chances of making the progress they are desperate to make in the coming season.",
      "\"I think we hit the intensity that was perfect for this moment because it is the second game of pre-season,\" De Ligt told MUTV. \"You can see already what intensity we can bring, but I think there is so much more potential in that aspect to do even more.",
      "\"Today you saw what kind of players we have: physical players who are really strong and really quick. I think if we can improve that, our gameplay becomes even better.\"",
      "Fernandes, who netted a penalty in the first half and clipped home a sublime finish for his second goal shortly after half-time, caught the eye in New Jersey, as did Matheus Cunha. The duo regularly linked up prior to being substituted midway through the second half.",
      "Although they took many of the plaudits, De Ligt believes everyone within the squad deserves credit for the way United have started their pre-season campaign.",
      "Asked if anyone has stood out so far this summer, the Dutchman added: \"No, not particularly because I think everyone has been training hard, everyone has been fit.",
      "\"I think if you look at the team today, there is no one who was worse than the others; I think everyone was on a good level.",
      "\"Obviously, Bruno scored two goals today. I think it has been nice to see Matheus come in from another club.",

      "England are on the brink of glory again under Sarina Wiegman.",
      "The Lionesses are just 90 minutes away from winning consecutive European Championship titles as they prepare to face Spain in Sunday's Euro 2025 final. England have made it hard for themselves after needing extra time and penalties to see off Sweden in the quarter-finals.",
      "Wiegman's side then needed extra time again in the semi-finals against Italy, but avoided the dreaded spot-kicks after Chloe Kelly's late winner. They now face the biggest test of all as they look to beat world champions Spain, who are chasing a first-ever women's European Championship title.",
      "I'm going to have to go with my head over my heart and say Spain. These England players must be physically and perhaps mentally fatigued after going the distance in both knockout games so far.",
      "And I think that will play a role in Sunday's final, with Spain being the worst possible opponents if you're tired, when you consider how well they keep the ball.",
      "England's ability to stay in games and the Spaniards' unconvincing win over Germany will give the Lionesses hope. But every tournament-winning team has an off day, and I fear that Spain have already had theirs.",
      "Prediction: Spain 2-0 England",
      "Only a matter of weeks ago, a Dutch manager showed us all how you mastermind a perfect English underdog performance against a highly fancied Spanish outfit in a major European final.",
      "Renee Slegers and Arsenal have given Sarina Weigman and the Lionesses a blueprint on how to beat the all-conquering Spanish juggernaut with their game plan in the Women's Champions League final against the mighty Barcelona in June.A resolute defensive performance through the first hour followed by a series of well-timed, direct and attacking second half substitutes to catch the now-frustrated possession-obsessed opponents cold.",
      "In Michelle Agyemang, Chloe Kelly and Aggie Beever-Jones, England have the required fire power to change the game from the bench, so long as the Lionesses can stay in the contest until those changes are made.",
      "Prediction: Spain 0-1 England",
      "Looking at the performances of the two teams so far in this tournament there should only be one winner in Spain, but luckily for England football doesn’t work that way.",
      "While the performances have not been perfect, the Lionesses have shown the fight and the never say die attitude to make it through the matches against Sweden and Italy, coming from behind in both to book their place in the final.",
      "England will be out for revenge as in Spain, they face the team who beat them in the World Cup final just two years ago. They will need all the fight that they have shown so far, and they do have the players to cause the opposition problems, whether that's from the start or from the bench. Strength in depth has been key for England so far this tournament.",
      "Spain’s struggles in the semi-final against Germany should also cause some optimism for England. The way the tournament has gone it just feels like it’s the Lionesses’ time again - I’m hoping it’s not just my heart talking.",
      "Prediction: Spain 1-2 England",
      "As a Portuguese supporter, I’d love to see England lift the Euro 2025 trophy - they’ve shown incredible heart, discipline, and resilience throughout the tournament. They've fought their way into a third consecutive major final, which is no small feat. That said, I do feel Spain might have a slight edge going into this clash. They’ve looked technically superior at times and are tactically sharp, which could pose real challenges for England.",
      "One concern I have is England's tendency to make tactical adjustments a bit too late in games. In high-stakes matches like this, timing is everything and against a composed, possession-dominant side like Spain, any hesitation in making changes could be costly. That said, I really hope I’m proven wrong.",
      "Players like Agyemang bring such energy and creativity to the pitch, and I’d love to see her get the start. If she and the rest of the squad rise to the occasion, there’s every chance England could bring the trophy home.",
      "To match that, I’m also predicting a goal fest.",
      "Prediction: Spain 2-3 England.",
      "The Lionesses are among the favourites to win this summer's Women's Euros and the new official kit is out now. Fans can snag home, away and a new goalkeeper shirts in time for the tournament.",

      "The Catalan club will cover Rashford's wages during his loan at Camp Nou, which is estimated to save Manchester United around £12million, and have the option to sign him permanently.",
      "Barcelona were linked with Liverpool forward Luis Diaz before reaching an agreement to sign Rashford. Liverpool have reiterated that the Colombia international is not for sale this summer, which Laporta has revealed contributed to finding an agreement with United to sign Rashford on loan.",
      "The La Liga champions also considered signing Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao. The winger was offered to Barcelona, but eventually signed a new long-term contract with the Basque club.",
      "Laporta spoke to Mundo Deportivo to give insight on the Rashford deal and the 63-year-old admitted Rashford was an option alongside Diaz and Williams this summer.",
      "\"It was a more complex matter than the goalkeeper situation due to the variety of opinions coming from all sides,\" Barcelona's president said. \"There were several options, and I’m very pleased that we ultimately secured the one I liked the most.",
      "\"It’s true I also liked Luis Diaz, a very complete player, but given Liverpool’s rigid stance, it was difficult. Still, I’m grateful that the player showed interest in joining us at all times.",
      "\"Then there was the case of Nico Williams. Seeing that the Diaz option was complicated and while we were in talks with Rashford, Nico’s agent came forward offering a deal.",
      "\"Deco brought it to my attention. At first, I preferred to focus on the other two options, but in these cases, I always trust the sporting director’s judgment. Deco suggested we at least hear them out because Nico is an interesting player who can hold the width on the wing.",
      "\"Negotiations were held, but the gap between what was initially presented and the final terms was significant — in terms of payment timelines, agent fees, and other variables — to the point where the deal no longer looked feasible.",
      "\"Deco set a 48-hour deadline, and if our conditions weren’t accepted, the deal would be off. In the end, it didn’t happen. Meanwhile, we kept working on the other two deals, and Rashford’s situation began to take shape.\"",
      "Laporta was asked what he liked about Rashford and responded: \"We’re very pleased because we’re bringing in a player of outstanding quality, at a great age to join Barca, and with exceptional motivation.",
      "\"I’ve personally seen just how excited he is about coming here. One of his greatest virtues is his sincerity. His dream was to play his entire career at Manchester United.",
      "\"He joined them at age seven and built a meaningful life there. He wanted to be a 'one-club man.' It’s heartwarming when a player says that so openly. But when something happened in his life that he didn’t expect, he looked toward the team he had always admired - Barca.",
      "\"He had faced us before and already had Barca on his radar. He was loaned to Aston Villa to showcase that he’s the best player of his generation, the best in England, and he now says his greatest motivation is to win the Champions League with Barca and the World Cup with England.\"",

      "After Arsenal visit, United are at Manchester City and host Chelsea in September. David Moyes complained that the fixture computer had pitted United against Chelsea, Liverpool and City in his first five fixtures. That defeatist attitude was one of innumerable reasons why he was always ill-suited to United.",
      "Amorim’s first full season begins similarly (Liverpool are also lurking around the corner in October). United were actually unbeaten in three games with City last season, two of their best performances were against Arsenal and they narrowly lost at Chelsea five days before the Europa League final.",
      "United will not look markedly different when they line-up against Arsenal. The best-case scenario is there will be three new starting signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and a new striker. The sight of his former Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres with a cannon stitched to his shirt rather than a devil may cause Amorim to drop to his haunches sooner than usual.",
      "Gyokeres was never a realistic target. The top-tier strikers on the market want to stay or play in the Champions League. United do not have the clout or wherewithal to move for Gyokeres or Alexander Isak. There was concrete competition for Cunha and Mbeumo but United were never going to be a tough sell for players at Wolves and Brentford.",
      "Every Premier League club last season possessed a superior striker to United, bar sorry Southampton. Southampton looked at signing Rasmus Hojlund a year before he joined United.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football, has overseen a shift to focus on Premier League recruits after United bought only one senior player from a Premier League club in nearly six years. At the time of writing, Ollie Watkins and Jean-Philippe Mateta are realistic options who would fit the bill up front: two centre forwards in their late 20s whose value is bound to dwindle after this summer.",
      "Unai Emery’s curious handling of Watkins when Marcus Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa piqued the striker. Mateta caused United plenty of grief at Selhurst Park and Old Trafford in two memorable Palace victories.",
      "Watkins has never broken the 20-goal barrier for Villa, though. Mateta hasn’t for Crystal Palace, either. It would be a stretch to bill either as 'proven'. They would still have a worthy support cast of Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad, Bruno Fernandes et al. and represent an upgrade on Hojlund.",
      "After successive seasons where they recorded a minus goal difference and their worst campaign in 51 years, United need a frontman they can get behind. That extends to the players, too. Plenty have always been unconvinced by Hojlund, a signing destined to fail through his exorbitant £72million fee and ties to Erik ten Hag’s agent, Kees Vos.",
      "Between the sticks is a goalkeeper lacking confidence from supporters. Andre Onana is set to continue as No.1 by default as United have focused their investments at the top end of the pitch.",
      "Onana is at least shielded by a quintet of centre backs with a promising blend of youth and experience. United signed a centre half in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. They will not be acquiring one this summer and what has been one of their weakest areas of the squad in recent years is now one of their strongest.",
      "Leny Yoro has found his feet, Harry Maguire has become a captain without the armband, Ayden Heaven has been a revelation and Matthijs de Ligt looked to have got to grips with the Premier League before injury. Lisandro Martinez - when he has recovered from injury - could be more influential in Amorim’s back three than he was for Ten Hag.",
      "There is a potential midfield minefield, though. Bruno Fernandes seems likely to be permanently relocated to a deeper role and you could play him in goal and he would still be the most influential player in the United side.",
      "But beyond him there are glaring issues. Manuel Ugarte’s form towards the end of last season was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final. Casemiro’s good form was reserved almost exclusively for the Europa League, so he could become redundant with no European football. Kobbie Mainoo has been primarily recognised by Ruben Amorim as a playmaker and Toby Collyer has started three games in his career against teams from League 1, Scotland and Romania.",
      "United would like to strengthen in midfield but the issue is the unshiftable Casemiro. Sources say four different figures were given mandates to sell him yet he seems certain to see out the final year of his United contract.",
      "Casemiro is valued at £15million and, realistically, no club is forking out that fee for a 33-year-old who will be free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement in January. Casemiro has regained his place in the Brazil squad after an 18-month exile but it helps matters that his former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti is in charge.",
      "United have valuable assets in midfield in Fernandes and Mainoo but the former rejected the opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia. The concern would be that United could cash in on Mainoo if a late bid comes in and frees up funds.",
      "There would be parallels with Scott McTominay, only this time last year Fulham’s interest in McTominay and United’s interest in Ugarte were well documented. McTominay was a sellable asset and always seemed likely to leave.",
      "Mainoo’s future is uncertain but there has not been a lot of noise around him so far this summer. His contract has a maximum expiry date of 2028 but he rejected United’s initial proposal of a renewal at the start of the year and it has been quiet on that front.",
      "Realistically, United could get through a lighter season with the aforementioned midfield quintet. A new midfielder should be at the top of the shopping list in 12 months.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon are imperfect options on the left wing but there are senior auxiliary alternatives. Mbeumo has to operate on the right-hand side, a problem position that United have struggled to solve for upwards of a decade. Mbeumo represents the best of both worlds in that he is adept at attacking and defending but United have to play to his strengths after a 20-goal season.",
      "Senior figures at United are targeting a top six finish. That is not pie-in-the-sky stuff when recent history shows clubs have shot up the table without European commitments. Newcastle United nabbed Champions League qualification in 2023 and 2025. Liverpool nearly won the league in 2014. Leicester City did win the league in 2016. So did Chelsea a year later.",
      "The exception is United. The last time they were out of Europe, they scraped fourth under Louis van Gaal in 2014-15, winning one of their final six fixtures. Van Gaal’s tenure got off to a startling start with defeat to Swansea City.",
      "He was never one to play on the front foot, though.",

      "United travelled to the USA on Tuesday and will be primarily based in Chicago. They are set to take on West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "The players seemed in high spirits during their flight and they trained for the first time since touching down on American soil on Wednesday at the Endeavour Health Performance Centre.",
      "So, here are four things we spotted from the first USA training session...",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £65m plus £6m in add-ons was announced on Monday evening, just in time for Mbeumo to join his new teammates on the USA plane.",
      "Club figures admitted they were delighted to have their top targets, Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, signed in time to travel on the pre-season tour, meaning Ruben Amorim has the chance to work closely with his new additions and convey his expectations for the season during an intense schedule.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are tremendous signings and should provide creativity and goals to the front line. United are in the market for a striker, which feels like the missing piece of the jigsaw for a formidable attack.",
      "United's new signings were pictured smiling during the session and it will be exciting to see them play alongside each other in the States, which could happen for the first time against West Ham.",
      "United often play small-sided games during training at Carrington and the photo of the 'winning team' is shared on social media. That looked to be the case again on Wednesday, as an eight-man team spearheaded by Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro posed for a celebratory picture.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Tom Heaton were the other senior players involved in the team, with youngsters Tyler Fredricson, Reece Munro, Bendito Mantato and Ethan Williams also playing a role.",
      "The pre-season tours are a brilliant chance for players to bond, given the time they are spending in close proximity to each other over a fortnight, and those benefits will be reaped later in the campaign.",
      "Leny Yoro grew in confidence each month last season. He was excellent after being moved to the left side of the three-man defence and could reach another level in his second year.",
      "Yoro has become comfortable in Manchester and spoke in the mixed zone after the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds. The Frenchman was also pictured conducting an in-house interview with MUTV after the training session and it's encouraging to see him speaking to the media more regularly.",
      "The 19-year-old has the qualities to become a leader in the United dressing room.",
      "Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a six-month loan in the January window and he was one of the most successful loans at United, making 17 appearances for the League Two side.",
      "The 19-year-old can play at left-wing back, or in one of the No.10 roles, and will be hopeful of making a strong impression during the USA tour, as he was picked ahead of a handful of other promising players.",

      "Manchester United are yet to add a new striker to their squad, despite links to Benjamin Sesko, with the new Premier League season set to kick off at home against Arsenal on August 17.\"",
      "A host of players have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, including Viktor Gyokeres, Ollie Watkins, and Nicolas Jackson. On Thursday, talkSPORT reported that United had made fresh contact with Aston Villa regarding Watkins, but the 29-year-old is believed to be valued at around £60million.",
      "But the club hierarchy are also keeping a close eye on Sesko’s situation after Arsenal abandoned negotiations for his services. The Gunners have instead chosen to pursue a deal for Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "Here, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest developments surrounding Sesko.",
      "According to journalist Christian Falk, Leipzig could consider a sale if an offer around the €70million (£60.6m) mark. Speaking to Caught Offside, Falk revealed United are closely monitoring the situation.",
      "\"When one door closes, another opens! Arsenal have withdrawn their pursuit of Benjamin Sesko, which creates an opportunity for Manchester United,\" he said. \"The Red Devils weren’t in the front row for the club and player. However, there’s a key executive involved in all of this – Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting.",
      "\"He’s previously worked for RB Leipzig, and he’s now supporting the potential deal. Vivell’s also been watching the situation develop since April. He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Sesko again. The striker (22) is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m].\"",
      "United could now be facing tough competition for Sesko, following the news that Alexander Isak is considering a move away from Newcastle United. On Thursday Fabrizio Romano reported that Newcastle were alert to Sesko's situation at Leipzig and have been informed about what it would take to sign him.",
      "Meanwhile, The Athletic's David Ornstein added that the Magpies are 'exploring a move' for the 22-year-old as a potential replacement for Isak. Eddie Howe's side have had a long-standing interest in the Slovenia star.",
      "However, it's said that a deal is challenging from a financial perspective.",
      "However, United hold a secret weapon over Newcastle. Recruitment director Christopher Vivell is now based at Old Trafford, but he previously worked with Sesko during his time at Leipzig.",
      "Vivell not only understands the strengths and weaknesses of pursuing a deal for Sesko, but he also has existing relationships with the player and his representatives - connections that could help facilitate a smoother negotiation process if United decide to make a move.",
      "\"Our striker Sesko, I was really impressed, to be honest,\" Ridle Baku, who joined Leipzig from Wolfsburg in January told FourFourTwo in March. \"The first training session, I knew already that he's a good player. But I'm speaking about potential, probably he's not [currently at] potential he could be, but right now, what I saw already, very impressive. He has everything to be a world-class player.\"",
      "\"He's still young, he still needs to learn, not the technical things about being a striker but maybe more the finesse side. He has everything, strength shooting, technique, everything. I like working with him and I'm trying to get him there – he'll go on and score a lot of goals for us and some point go to the club he'll love to play for.\""

      "Newcastle are linked with two Premier League strikers and a Manchester United target as the consider the prospect of life after Alexander Isak…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Emi Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited have been heavily linked with the Villa keeper, but their intent was limited to a pitiful loan offer which the Villans, understandably, laughed off. Reports in Argentina suggest that’s as far as United will go, and Martinez will instead consider cashing in over in Saudi.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nOh, Spurs. Got the here we go treatment from Romano before Forest pulled the plug and threatened legal action against Spurs for knowing the player’s release clause, and now according to Ornstein is all set for a new deal at his current club. A deal that presumably includes an even more super secret release clause that specifically states Spurs can’t activate it.",
      "",
      "18) Malick Fofana – Lyon to Everton\nFabrizio says ‘advanced talks’ but Everton making a high-profile attempt to sign a Liverpool target just feels like something destined to end in pain just because that’s the way of the world.",
      "",
      "17) Luke Shaw – Manchester United to Saudi\nThis hasn’t reached the stage yet of a suitor being named but reports suggest Shaw has seen the writing on the wall for his United career and he’s willing to make the best of it by taking the Saudi coin. Sadly, Ruben Amorim will have taken the view that Shaw’s fitness cannot be relied upon, and he is now well-stocked for left wing-backs. There is no urgency here – it could be one for January.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "16) Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko seemed to be going nowhere while Leipzig were demanding in excess of £75million but in news sure to grind Arsenal’s gears, reports in Germany suggest that demand could have fallen to £59million, which would make the Slovenian much more appealing to United.",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £50m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "12) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Nothing on Isak, mind…",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "8) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent has been in Turin this week to attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and he is the first on their list should Isak get his wish.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Viktor Gyokeres is in London, which means Arsenal can ramp up their pursuit of the Palace star, which they intend to do…",
      "",
      "5) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way. The latest: the two clubs are ‘in dialogue’, while Diaz was left out of Liverpool’s squad for Saturday’s pre-season friendly defeat to Milan.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "3)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe didn’t think this done just because Newcastle had told Liverpool that Isak was not for sale. Their stance hasn’t changed – but everything else has after Isak agitated for a move. If only he had done it sooner, Liverpool might not have spent the money on Hugo Ekitike, who might have filled the Isak void at Newcastle. Instead, the expectation is the pair will team up at Anfield. It won’t happen quick – Newcastle are determined to dig in and their worst-case scenario has to involve a British transfer record fee – but it’ll probably happen.",
      "",
      "2)🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first. Hato was left out of the Ajax squad for Thursday night’s friendly against Celtic in Como.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Juventus – £91.84m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Garnacho has fallen in the pecking order at Man Utd as he has butted heads with Ruben Amorim over his poor form and attitude during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The winger has also been impacted by the implementation of Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation as he is not suited to the No.10 position in this system.",
      "This situation boiled over following United‘s loss to Spurs in the Europa League final as Garnacho publicly hit out at the club after he only made a brief cameo off the bench in the 1-0 defeat.",
      "Amorim subsequently informed Garnacho that he needs to ‘find a new club’ this summer, but he is yet to secure a move elsewhere.",

      "Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho are also part of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ as Old Trafford chiefs look to raise funds for signings, but the club’s desperation is limiting their negotiating power.",
      "Despite this, Amorim claimed on Friday that they will not be held to ransom by interested clubs as they remain intent on sticking to their demands for unwanted talents.",
      "Amorim explained: “Some players have to move to make space in the team, others want a new challenge.",
      "“We are giving them time to think and if they reach a point where they have to join the team they will.",
      "“Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] have a number for these players, if that isn’t reached they will be United players.",
      "“I am ready to receive the players. I have more options and if they have to fight each other to play that is perfect.”",
      "While this indicates that the Red Devils are willing to be patient with the Garnacho saga, a report from GiveMeSport claims they have set a deadline for his exit as they ‘want to sell him in days’.",
      "Though an ‘added layer of difficulty’ has been added to a proposed deal, as £60m-rated Garnacho’s preference is to remain in the Premier League.",
      "This is while there have been fresh ‘private talks’ over Garnacho. The report adds:",
      "‘Serie A champions Napoli had shown a strong interest in January and also before the summer window officially opened, but because of Garnacho’s preference to remain in the Premier League, they have looked at alternative options instead.",
      "‘GMS sources understand that Garnacho’s exit has now been made a priority by club chiefs, and private talks in recent days have seen them push to get the player to make a decision on his next club before the end of the month.’",
      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer.",

      "It has been widely reported that Barcelona has been his preferred destination since he announced at the end of December that he intended to leave Man Utd.",
      "It was hoped that Ruben Amorim’s appointment would inspire Rashford‘s return to form at Man Utd, but they butted heads en route to him leaving in January.",
      "Rashford eventually had to settle on a loan move to Aston Villa as his poor form/attitude and huge salary provided stumbling blocks for other clubs in the winter window, but he returned to form under Unai Emery.",
      "The England international contributed four goals and six assists for Aston Villa to spark more widespread interest this summer and he’s got a move to Barcelona after they missed out on Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "READ: Top 10 Alexander Isak clones only leave three options for Newcastle, Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "Barcelona already have two of the best wingers in the world as Lamine Yamal and Raphinha are credible 2025 Ballon d’Or contenders, but Rashford’s versatility will be useful as he will provide quality cover in various positions.",
      "Still, a report in Spain claims Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Robert Lewandowski have been ‘genuinely upset by Joan Laporta and Deco’s decision to sign him’.",
      "This is while fellow summer signing Roony Bardghji has been ‘affected’ as he faces having limited opportunities in his debut campaign.",
      "Barcelona are also known to have financial difficulties and Rashford’s move could be set to ‘trigger’ three exits in ‘inevitable consequences’, with a ‘loan exit’ for Bardghji ‘not ruled out’.",
      "This is while other players are ‘already completely sentenced and have been forced to pack their bags’. This is the case with Pau Víctor and Jan Virgili.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Victor is already negotiating to leave Camp Nou as soon as possible. He won’t be travelling on the Asian tour, and his future was set to be with Valencia, but in the last few hours, everything has taken a radical turn, and he’s most likely moving to Portugal. More specifically, to Sporting Braga, who are willing to pay around €12 million for his signing.",
      "‘And Virgili soon received the first blow, after Flick decided to drop him after the first training sessions and didn’t call him up for the trip to Asia. It seems that RCD Mallorca will be the team that ends up recruiting the winger born in 2006 , who could follow Pablo Torre’s example.’",
      "Marcus Rashford is said to be a “very lucky boy” to leave Manchester United for Barcelona as a move to the Championship club would be more “logical”.",
      "Lamine Yamal reportedly feels he has been ‘deceived’ by Barcelona over the signing of Marcus Rashford, and is angry that he was not ‘involved’ in the transfer decision, like Lionel ...",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford should’ve departed Manchester United a hero. Instead, his exit prompts barely a shrug as he gambles on Barca levers…",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports."

      "Either Newcastle United will be targeting a player similar to Alexander Isak if he leaves for Liverpool, or the Reds might be looking for another alternative to the Swede even after signing Hugo Ekitike, especially when they realise he is the worst finisher in Europe.",
      "Newcastle have been linked with Benjamin Sesko but FBRef’s statistical models claim these are the closest 10 players to Isak across Europe’s big five leagues.",
      "We take a look and wonder whether Liverpool or Newcastle might be interested, or maybe even Manchester United; they need a striker more than anybody.",
      "",
      "10) Kylian Mbappe (Real Madrid)\nWe start with a player obviously very attainable. A ridiculous player with ridiculous statistics. Didn’t help Real Madrid win any trophies last season though, did he?In all seriousness, Liverpool really did come relatively close to signing the Frenchman, who apparently agreed to join the Reds three years ago for £169m. But PSG wanted a world-record fee, just two years before losing him for nowt.",
      "And now Liverpool are briefing the media that they think they have signed a player with Mbappe-like potential in Ekitike. Even better than the real thing?",
      "",
      "9) Vinicius Jnr (Real Madrid)\nThis is why Real Madrid are not in the market for Isak; they already have two pretty good clones. And with the Brazilian’s price being in the £300m-plus bracket, the only suitors are likely to come from the Middle East. Remember when Vinicius being a target for Manchester United was briefly A Thing? Good times.",
      "",
      "8) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nWe took the pee out of Liverpool’s attempts to brush over the fact that the Frenchman has a poor goalscoring record but he was probably the very closest they could sign to Isak in terms of style, which will be handy if they don’t manage to sign the original too…",
      "",
      "7) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nNow this one really does make sense for Newcastle. He’s likely to be pushed down the Chelsea pecking order by Joao Pedro and Liam Delap and Manchester United have been strongly linked. But Newcastle can offer a) Champions League football and b) a style that suits Jackson rather more than the Pep-ball Lite at Stamford Bridge. All Chelsea need to do is stop pretending he is worth £80m and double their money at around £65m instead.",
      "",
      "6) Mateo Retegui (Al-Qadsiah)\nThe Italian striker has already taken the filthy lucre (over £50m over three years, according to reports) to leave Atalanta for Saudi Arabia, so it will be a hot year at least before he is looking for a transfer back to Europe.",
      "",
      "5) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City)\nPoor Eintracht Frankfurt. They lost Marmoush to Man City in January after an excellent 15-goal half-season and then lost Ekitike to Liverpool in July after a 15-goal full season. We have a feeling that Marmoush may be brilliant for City in 25/26 after a full Pep pre-season.",
      "But it does mean that we only have Jackson as a viable alternative to Isak so far and things are not about to get any better…",
      "",
      "4) Jonathan Burkardt (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nThe 18-goal Mainz striker is the replacement for Ekitike (or is it Marmoush?) so he’s another Isak-like footballer who is not available to Newcastle United, Liverpool or Manchester United.",
      "",
      "3) Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan)\nNow this is genuinely interesting as the Frenchman was strongly linked with Newcastle United two years ago, while links with Manchester United have been persistent, and even Arsenal have had a sniff.",
      "He scored 14 Serie A goals last season and outscored his xG by 4.1, but the number that might put off potential suitors is his age: He will be 28 next month, making him over two years older than Isak.",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)\nEx-Manchester United footballers will never tire of telling you Manchester United should sign Harry Kane. It ain’t going to happen yet, but we think he will be back.",
      "",
      "1) Georges Mikautadze (Lyon)\nWe predicted a Manchester United move in the wake of his brilliance at Euro 2024 and he has since been linked with the Reds, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United and Sunderland. He would be the cheapest option on this list by some margin, with Lyon looking for around £25m for the Georgian striker who scored 11 Ligue Un goals last season despite starting just 13 games as he found Alexandre Lacazette a difficult man to shift."

The obvious candidate? Crystal Palace’s very own no. 10 Eberechi Eze. What a signing he could be.",

Fabio Carvalho would probably like the upgrade but frankly, he’s lucky to keep the 14 after that first season.",

      "",
      "Everton: 3, 4, 8, 9 and 11\nEverton need numbers; they currently have 16 senior outfield players and that is decidedly not enough. We expect Thierno Barry to take the No. 9 but the many squad number gaps reflect the need for Everton to recruit across the board.",

      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer.",
      "United have already sent Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, but are still seeking solutions for Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Speaking on Friday, Amorim admitted he’s open to reintegrating Garnacho, Antony, Sancho, and Malacia if moves fail to materialize.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Amorim is genuinely open to their return or simply avoiding weakening the club’s negotiating position further after publicly saying Garnacho is unwanted.",

      "Asked if he’s happy with the new arrivals of Cunha, Mbeumo and young left-back Diego Leon, Amorim said: “Really pleased. It’s important to sign new players as soon as possible. Sometimes it’s not possible but I’m really pleased.",
      "The 40-year-old added that he wants Premier League-proven players in his squad and believes Cunha, 26, has the perfect mix of youth and experience.",
      "“They’ve proved already in the Premier League; that is really important in the moment,” he said.",
      "“Matheus can play in different positions, so you can change the starting XI so I’m pleased.",

      "“That was a policy we try to use this season, so I say yes, it’s not just that, they have characteristics that we need but we buy players who can face this kind of pressure.”",
      "Amorim added: “The new signings are really humble, that is really important, and they chose to be here.",
      "“They had other options, Champions League options, they read what people say about our club but they chose to be here and this is a key point for me.",
      "“In the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player.",
      "“If I have to start the season with this squad I will be happy because all the players that are here want to be here. With Matheus and Bryan we are clearly a better team.”",
      "United are expected to sign an out-and-out centre-forward due to Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee’s unconvincing form.",

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with Manchester United unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that seven of the ten biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for two of the others when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono, while Saudi side Al-Qadsiah apparently went overboard bringing in Mateo Retegui.",
      "But those eight Premier League overpays, made by five of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool)",
      "Fee: £69m rising to £79m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £82.9m",
      "The Liverpool spin puts Ekitike firmly in the Haaland and Mbappe bracket in terms of potential at his age. And there is certainly an element of speculating to accumulate after committing such sums on a striker with 44 goals in 136 appearances",
      "It could all go quite Darwin Nunez, with an enticing European reputation, add-ons destined to remain unfulfilled and the hints of beautiful chaos not quite enough to sustain a career at a competent club ultimately driven by numbers.",
      "But it is notable that far less of the final value of the Ekitike signing is tied up in those performance-based clauses, while the guaranteed portion is higher too. Liverpool clearly feel he is the real thing who can be carefully nurtured, developed and moulded over time at Anfield.",
      "That does not make it a certainty that Ekitike will come good – no such thing exists in the world of transfers – but everyone is at least on the same page this time at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £65m rising to £71m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £47.7m",
      "It is little wonder an ‘angry’ Manchester United ‘slammed’ Brentford once the deal to sign Mbeumo was finally completed 44 days after their opening bid.",
      "That came in at around £45m plus £10m in add-ons, which the Bees were never going to accept but a testing of the waters was entirely necessary.",
      "Once a second offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons was rejected Ruben Amorim’s side had a choice to make: begrudgingly accept that various taxes from a Manchester United one to a general Premier League levy was going to be applied; or walk away from a deal for their priority target who they had already invested a large amount of the transfer window on pursuing.",
      "There was at one stage an insistence that Manchester United would not be held to ransom but they excel at few things more than baulking at a fee while paying it.",
      "This is their new transfer policy and it costs a pretty penny.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m rising to £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £48.5m rising to £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £62.5m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £52m",
      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",
      "It is unknown precisely how far Manchester United would have gone in the bidding if Cunha wasn’t accompanied by a release clause which specified his price tag – or indeed if they would have targeted him at all without one.",
      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",
      "And if all else fails, Manchester United will simply continue Cunha’s career trend of being sold for £18m profit every two years.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea)",
      "Fee: £55m rising to £60m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer.",
      "Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice has hit out at the Gunners fans that criticised the signing of Noni Madueke before he even arrived at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "An ex-Arsenal striker has urged the Gunners to sign a free agent forward after sealing the £63m deal for Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "Marc Cucurella has questioned the timing of Noni Madueke’s transfer to Arsenal, calling it ‘strange’ and a missed opportunity.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "A former Arsenal player has backed Noni Madueke to become a starter, while criticising fan reaction and comparing him to Kai Havertz."

For a player at the peak of his career that they’ve nurtured to possibly only get £25m for him if Barcelona buy him next summer, having paid an absolute arm and a leg in wages over the years, isn’t recompense at all,” Collymore told Caught Offside.",
      "“For the player, it’s quite unbelievable. He had a poor last season at Man United, goes to Aston Villa. Cameo appearances that were not particularly great, but by the way that Gary Lineker talks, you’d thought it was Lionel Messi playing for Villa last season.",
      "“For Barcelona, what do they get? They get a player on the cheap whose wages will be nowhere near the £300k mark if they were to buy him permanently next summer.",
      "“But they get the best of the deal, quite simply, because they’re going to get a player that’s motivated to play for them. All that was coming out through the season last season was, Marcus Rashford won’t sign for Aston Villa permanently because he’s waiting for Barcelona.”",
      "Collymore has also explained why a move to a Championship team would make more sense for Rashford at this stage.",
      "“I think the greatest story here is how players can effectively be so poor for a couple of seasons, basically, including the loan at Villa, and still dictate where they want to go to a club that’s playing in the Champions League and arguably among the four or five biggest clubs on the planet. And I find that remarkable,” Collymore continued.",
      "“I think that from a Barcelona perspective, it’s only because they’re still coming out of that negative financial situation that they were in, so that they were doing lots of wheeling and dealing in the last three or four years.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford, make no bones about it, he’s a very, very, very lucky boy, because if football had any logic, he would probably be getting a move to Blackburn, Norwich or another aspirational championship club – certainly not one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",
      "According to reports, three Barcelona stars are ‘genuinely upset’ at Marcus Rashford’s transfer as he is to ‘trigger’ three summer exits.",

      "Manchester United face a ‘dilemma’ over the future of Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Tottenham amid claims the midfielder’s agent is ‘not asking for too much money’.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit for the last year, with Chelsea approaching the Red Devils last summer and again in January over a move for the England international.",
      "United initially insisted Mainoo was ‘untouchable’ and then slapped a £70m price tag on his head amid their PSR woes and the midfielder’s dip in form.",
      "TBR Football claimed on Thursday that Tottenham have made a ‘shock enquiry’ to sign Mainoo and ‘actually stand a chance of signing’ the England international.",
      "Spurs ‘have asked about signing’ Mainoo as the north Londoners ‘appreciate the 20-year-old and are keeping abreast of his contract situation, which still hasn’t been agreed’.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is ‘keen to add another’ midfielder this summer and Mainoo could fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford with the World Cup just around the corner.",
      "With that in mind, Mainoo ‘will be eager to be playing regular football’ and that ‘could open the door for Spurs and Chelsea’ as TBR Football ‘sources suggest he could still move this summer’.",
      "Talks over a contract extension have stalled after it was claimed Mainoo’s representatives were asking for £180,000 per week for him to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "Those reports were later refuted, but with Mainoo currently earning just £25,000 per week and with two years left on his deal, as Dean Saunders explains, United face a ‘dilemma’.",
      "Saunders told talkSPORT: “I know his agent, and he’s not asking for too much money in comparison to what the players are earning at Man United.",
      "“But it’s a dilemma for the football club, what do you do with Mainoo? How much money do you pay him?",
      "“Because he’s actually not done much in the game but gets in the England squad and now he’s in Man United’s team and there’s players earning three times more than him, four times more than him.",
      "“So to protect their asset, how much money have you got to give him to get him to sign a new contract?",
      "“Or, if he’s not going to sign it, they’re going to have to sell him, otherwise he walks out on a free. But I think he’d get in Spurs’ team.”",
      "Tottenham have made an approach to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as his contract saga drags on, according to reports.",
      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes."

      "Shaw is therefore facing the possibility of being fourth choice left wing-back in Amorim’s favoured 3-4-3 system, behind Leon, Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, who was a regular starter in that position last term, though Shaw has also operated as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "The Sun claim the 30-year-old ‘is aware of serious interest from Saudi clubs and is ready to listen to offers’ amid ‘fears his Red Devils career might be nearing an end’ despite having two years left on his contract, though Amorim is ‘in no hurry’ to get rid of him.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Shaw is seen as a popular and influential figure within the dressing room and Amorim is in no hurry to dump him or his £150,000-a-week wages. But the player himself is determined to make up for so much lost time and knows he faces a tough decision on his future over the coming months.",
      "‘Should he decide to leave it is unlikely United would be difficult to deal with in terms of a fee considering all those injuries and his lack of appearances – only 27 in the last two campaigns.’",

      "“They need someone to look at and go, ‘That’s how you play as a number nine, that’s how you do it!’, and when you buy someone who hasn’t got as much experience as I’d like, I think that’s another risk.",

      "“Would I be happy with Manchester United going into the season as we are now? No. I want one more, I’m being greedy. I want a striker and if I don’t get a striker, I’d go midfield,” Ferdinand continued.",

      "“Would I get a number nine I’m not sure about, who is a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba who has Premier League experience? I’m going Baleba.",
      "“That’s who I’d get, I think he would have a huge impact on this squad and on this team.",

The Newcastle striker’s transfer request came at the worst time for the Gunners, while Liverpool might already be feeling some buyer’s remorse after spending big on the versatile Hugo Ekitike.",

      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",

      "\"With Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.\"",
      "United have always been in the market for a striker, but their focus is on player sales.",
      "Amorim said: \"They (Mbeumo/Cunha) can play as a striker. We have Josh (Zirkzee) and Rasmus (Hojlund), the focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work. They have other players fighting for that position.",
      "\"I'm really pleased. They are really humble, that is really important, and they chose to be here. They had other options, Champions League options, they read everything people say about our club, but they chose to be here. That is a key point for me.\"",

It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."
