      "Liverpool have reportedly been contacted by Serie A side Napoli over striker Darwin Nunez, according to reports, but their interest in Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund could complicate the deal.",
      "Nunez joined Liverpool for £85million in 2022 but has had mixed success at Anfield and fell down the pecking order under manager Arne Slot this season.",
      "The Uruguayan has been strongly linked with an exit from Liverpool after he made just eight starts in the Premier League under Slot and had to settle for appearances in cup competitions as he scored just seven times in total.",
      "The 25-year-old will be desperate for regular game time ahead of Uruguay possibly appearing at the 2026 World Cup next summer. Now, according to Football Italia, Napoli have reportedly reached out to Liverpool over a move.",
      "It says the club have promised boss Antonio Conte a raft of new signings after they won the Serie A title and the Italian is eager to secure another striker that can compete with Romelu Lukaku up front.",
      "The report adds Napoli are \"pushing\" for Nunez, but might struggle to agree a fee given that Liverpool paid so much for his services three years ago and won't want to take a big loss on profit.",
      "Nunez scored 34 goals in 41 appearances for Benfica in his final season in 2021-22 but only managed 15 in his debut season. He then scored 18 in 2023-24 in Jurgen Klopp's last campaign before opportunities began drying up under Slot.",
      "It goes on to say that Napoli could turn to United star Hojlund as an alternative, which would be a blow for Liverpool as they look to balance the books in the event that they sign Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz - who is being priced at £126m.",
      "A move to Napoli for Hojlund would see him return to Italy's top flight two years after he left Atalanta in a £72m deal.",
      "Hojlund has failed to impress since arriving at Old Trafford and managed only four goals in the Premier League last season, having scored ten in the previous campaign.",
      "Napoli have already been quick to make their first signing of the summer transfer window after announcing the arrival of Kevin de Bruyne on a free transfer from Manchester City.",
      "De Bruyne was given a hero's welcome after jetting into Naples - and the club revealed his signing by uploading a picture of the Belgian star sitting on the throne, with the caption: \"King Kev is here.\"",

      "It was recently claimed that the Swedish hitman was willing to go on strike to force a move away from Sporting after they appeared to ramp up their asking price after promising to sell him for a modest fee. And Gyokeres has now released a cryptic statement on social media amid the transfer furore.",

      "Louis Saha displayed remarkable kindness by gifting a physio a hefty envelope filled with £50 notes as a thank you for helping him through his injury woes. The French striker initially made waves in the Premier League with Fulham, before he went on to join Manchester United in 2004.",
      "During his time at United, he clinched two Premier League titles, the Champions League, and a League Cup under Sir Alex Ferguson's stewardship, bagging 42 goals across 124 matches over four years. Injuries, however, saw Saha fall out of favour, prompting his move from Old Trafford to Everton in 2008.",
      "Despite ongoing fitness battles, he still managed to score a commendable 35 goals in 115 games for the Toffees from 2008 to 2012. Saha's relationship with Everton's medical staff was notably positive, especially with ex-club physio Mick Rathbone.",
      "Rathbone, once dubbed the 'best signing ever' by David Moyes, recounted a touching story about Saha's generous act after signing a new contract deal at Goodison Park in 2010.",
      "\"We were excited about working with Louis despite his injury-prone reputation,\" the former Preston medic wrote in his book, The Smell of Football. \"In his first season at the club, we were extremely careful with him, in terms of not pushing him too hard.",
      "\"We quickly gained his trust because he intimated that at all his previous clubs, he felt this had not necessarily been the case. By his second season we had developed a relationship that allowed us to push him harder.",
      "\"In those two seasons, Louis played nearly 70 games and scored more than 20 goals for Everton, despite being injured and out for six weeks when he first came to us from Manchester United.\"",
      "Rathbone added: \"When Louis signed his new contract in February 2010, Bill Ellaby, the player liaison officer, handed me an envelope. He explained it was a thank you from Louis. I was touched he had taken the trouble to thank me in writing. I opened the envelope thinking, 'F*** me, this is a thick letter.'\".",
      "\"But it wasn't a letter; it was an envelope stuffed with £50 notes. That is the type of gratitude I prefer. After all, let's face it, talk is cheap. Apparently, he rewarded every member of the medical staff in the same way. I think he respected us for the care and time we gave him. It was a magnificent gesture from a great guy.\"",
      "Saha may no longer be on the football pitch, but he's certainly not short of cash these days, with a net worth that dwarfs even that of Cristiano Ronaldo, his ex-teammate at United. Since retiring in 2013 at 35, the former France international has dived into the business world with impressive results.",
      "His enterprise 'AxisStars', co-founded with Kate Hamer, is now said to be valued at an eye-watering £4.3billion. The firm seeks to forge links between 'professional athletes and entertainers, their peers and trusted partners'.",
      "The business empire of Saha towers over Ronaldo's hefty £600m fortune, being more than seven times larger. Saha, alongside former marketer Hamer and tech guru Patrice Arnera, has seen his venture flourish.",
      "With over 550 ex-sports stars linked to the company, Saha admits that his enterprise, AxisStars, has eclipsed his achievements on the pitch. \"I still get asked for advice by different people on a daily basis,\" he told The Guardian.",
      "\"For instance, my agent called me to say he had a talented French footballer who he wants to bring to England, and asked me for advice on how to create a tailor-made training programme. I put him in touch with people I used to work with.",
      "\"This kind of player could join Axis as he can then search for a personal coach in his region. It is a hard process but it's so rewarding, because if I can help 100,000 people, it's the best thing I've ever done.\"",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is not the first Sporting Lisbon player to be at the centre of a huge transfer saga. Gyokeres, 27, reportedly wants to leave the club this summer and is linked to a handful of Premier League sides.",
      "Recent reports have claimed the ex-Coventry City forward has threatened to go on strike to force an exit. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been heavily linked, but it appears either club will have a hard time bartering with the Portuguese champions, who are demanding £67million, despite Gyokeres reportedly being of the impression that he could depart for as little as £60m.",
      "Six years ago, Gyokeres' potential future team-mate Bruno Fernandes - who was at Sporting at the time - was of interest to United and Tottenham, but the club were reluctant to sell. Eventually, United signed him at the end of the 2020 January transfer window in a £67.8m deal.",
      "Before the Red Devils secured his signature, Ronaldo made a six-word remark where he appeared to tell Fernandes to do everything he could to leave the Jose Alvalade Stadium. Speaking to Portuguese television station TVi, Ronaldo said: \"Nobody knows why he (Fernandes) doesn't leave.\"",
      "The ex-United forward also said he had spoken to Fernandes and urged him to do everything he could to fulfil his potential, suggesting the midfielder has to leave Sporting to get to the top of his game. He added: \"Possibly this new generation will be the best at the talent level.",
      "\"But that's not enough. They have to want to. I have spoken to him [Fernandes]. I'm a captain who wants to help and be helped.”",
      "Gyokeres is no international team-mate of Ronaldo's but he can certainly relate to what the now Al-Nassr forward said to Fernandes. Ronaldo also left Sporting to join United in a £12.2m move all the way back in 2003.",
      "While Sir Alex Ferguson said United had a positive relationship with Sporting, the Scot also admitted the deal took, \"some time\" to get over the line. United failed in signing Fernandes in the 2019 summer transfer market and were close to missing out on him again the following January, but managed to secure a deal with one day left of the window.",
      "If United are to sign Gyokeres this year, they could be made to wait in similar fashion. Portuguese outlet Record understands Gyokeres was under the impression that he and the club had agreed a gentleman's agreement, which would allow him to leave if a bid of £50m plus £8.4m in add-ons was made.",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas recently denied the existence of this agreement. The Lisbon chief said: \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that. To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Lisbon are now understood to be after £67m from potential suitors. Gyokeres has scored a barnstorming 97 goals in 102 appearances since his £20m move from Coventry City in 2023. CNN Portugal recently claimed Gyokeres' agent Hasan Cetinkaya has met with Arsenal's owners.",
      "It's also understood that the north Londoners sent a delegation to Lisbon last month to discuss a move for the striker. Talks are described as being \"very advanced\" between the two sides.",
      "However, Arsenal have also been linked with a move for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. The young Slovenian has been on their radar for a long time, but the Daily Mail understands the Bundesliga giants are demanding at least £75m for his services.",

      "Manchester United have completed the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. The 26 year-old Brazilian international forward has signed a contract until June 2030, with the option of an additional year.",
      "Brazil forward Cunha, United’s first signing of the summer window, said: “It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player. Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt.",
      "“I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality. I can’t wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my teammates and prepare for the season ahead.",
      "“All my focus is now on working hard to become a valuable part of the team, and helping get this club back to the top.”  Jason Wilcox, United’s Director of Football, said: “Bringing in Matheus was one of our main priorities for this summer, so we are delighted to have completed his signing so early in the window.",
      "“He has proved his ability to succeed in the Premier League as one of the most exciting and productive forwards in England during his time at Wolves, and before that in Spain and Germany.",
      "“He has all the qualities we are looking for as we seek to build a strong, dynamic and entertaining team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.”",
      "The deal had been announced initially by both United and former club Wolves on June 1. In a short club statement, Wolves declared: \"Everyone at Wolves would like to thank Matheus for his contributions in old gold and wish he and his family the best of luck for the future.\"",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "United prioritised a move for Cunha this summer after his exploits for Wolves in 2024-25 and their own failings in front of goal. United were the Premier League's fifth lowest scorers, while the Brazilian scored 17 goals and added six assists as he earned Wolves' Players' Player of the Season award.",
      "His flexibility also appealed, with head coach Ruben Amorim penciling in a role for Cunha as one of his two No.10s in the Portuguese's preferred 3-4-2-1 formation. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is the top target for the other role, while United are still pushing for a new No.9 also.",
      "Cunha only signed a new contract at Molineux in February, having failed to land a big-money move in January. His new deal contained the £62.5m release clause which United have agreed to pay, but only after attempting to persuade Wolves to allow them to meet the terms of the clause over a longer period.",
      "Instead, Wolves refused to budge, and United quickly agreed to pay the full amount as per the terms in his contract with the Black Country side, meaning Wolves will see £20.83m up front, another £20.83m at the end of the 2025-26 season, and the remaining £20.83m at the end of the 2026-27 campaign."

The 27-year-old striker has caught the eye of several of Europe's biggest clubs since becoming one of the most lethal forwards on the continent in the past two seasons.",
      "Gyokeres netted a sensational 54 goals in 52 matches this term on his way to helping Sporting clinch a domestic double. Arsenal, Chelsea, Juventus and Manchester United, managed by his former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, have all shown interest in signing the Swede this summer.",

      "Regardless of the price tag Gyokeres eventually leaves Sporting for, Coventry may not see any financial gain from his sale. The Sweden international spent two seasons with the Championship side following an initial loan deal from Brighton, netting 40 goals in 97 games before joining Sporting for an initial £20m.",

The sell-on clause was said to be worth 10 per cent of any profit on the initial fee Sporting paid to originally sign the player.",
      "However, the Coventry Telegraph reported last summer that the fee was actually reduced by just five percent after Sporting paid the Championship side €1m (£843,500), in addition to the player hitting “certain objectives” over the course of the season.",
      "Initially, Coventry stood to gain 15% of any profit on the initial fee paid by Sporting if Gyokeres was sold on. This percentage was subject to change based on the player's performance, including goals, appearances and club honours, which were add-ons to the initial fee, and amount to €2m (almost £1.7m).",
      "The Sky Blues are said to have received just over £2.5m in add-ons from the initial €20m (£17.5m) fee, bringing their earnings to date up to £20m.",

Officially, there has not been an offer yet, but there have been many contacts. This time, it seems that there will be [an offer].”",

      "RMC Sport previously reported that the United academy graduate was convinced by De Zerbi's style of play and the opportunity to compete in the Champions League. Gomes had announced he would be leaving Lille once his contract expired this summer.",
      "The midfielder made the move to Lille at the end of his United contract in the summer of 2020, having been tipped for great things at Old Trafford after signing for the club back in 2006. The England U21s European Championship winner was handed his debut aged just 16 by Mourinho on the final day of the 2016/17 season, making him United's youngest ever Premier League player.",
      "But despite the trust placed in him by the current Fenerbahce boss, a 17-year-old Gomes was once brought to the brink of tears as a result of Mourinho criticising his performance in a reserve team match in front of the first team.",
      "He told the Athletic: \"I played a game for the reserves and he watched — he didn’t think I played good enough. Two days later, the first team had a game, and he took me with the team. At the pre-match, in front of everybody, he let me know about it.\"",
      "Expanding on the story in an interview with The Times, Gomes explained: \"At the time I was thinking, 'Why has he done that in front of everyone? Could he not have pulled me to the side?'",
      "\"A few of the players came up to me and said, 'He just wants a reaction from you, don't let it faze you', but in that moment, I didn't want to hear anything.",
      "'I rushed to my room and rang my dad and my brother. There's not much they could say to me really. I was almost crying. I was really young.",
      "\"It wasn't until I was older that I realised, with Mourinho, he's always looking at ways to get more out of you. I think him doing that in front of everyone showed he valued me as a player. I probably needed it.\"",
      "He added: \"It's all mental toughness. What I came to learn about Jose is he always wants you to do better. He is almost like prodding you, 'Come on, show me a bit more. Everyone's told me how good you are, but I want to see it.'\"",

      "Sebastian Kehl, the Borussia Dortmund sporting director, has played down talk of a third move for Jadon Sancho after the Manchester United forward was linked with a shock return to the Bundesliga club.",
      "Sancho, 25, is out of favour at Old Trafford and spent the 2024-25 season on loan at Chelsea. He is at a career crossroads, though, with the Blues set to pay a £5million penalty fee rather than completing a £25m permanent transfer for the star.",

      "“Of course, contact with Jadon is always there, in some way, because we have a very long history,” Kehl ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup on Thursday.",
      "“But it’s not an issue for us right now. We have other priorities at the moment and that’s why the Sancho issue was probably played up more in the media than discussed internally.”",
      "Sancho established himself as one of Europe's brightest stars at Dortmund across a four-year spell before joining United in a £73m deal in the summer of 2021.",
      "And with his career at a standstill it was Dortmund who gave him a platform to play again during the second half of the 2023-24 campaign, where he helped his old club reach the final of the Champions League.",
      "Dortmund's reported interest in Sancho comes amid claims that a trio of Premier League clubs are interested in offering the winger a chance to kickstart his career.",
      "Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all said to be keeping an eye on Sancho's situation with a permanent exit from Old Trafford likely in the coming weeks. Villa took Sancho's United team-mate, Marcus Rashford, on loan for the second half of last season but a permanent deal does not appear to be on the cards, hence their interest in Sancho.",

      "Hojlund scored just five Premier League goals at club level last season, though his Europa League exploits allowed him to reach double figures in all competitions. He started the first game in Denmark's friendly double-header, drawing a blank against Northern Ireland, and dropped to the bench for the meeting with Lithuania on Tuesday.",
      "One man who has found goals much easier to come by at club level is compatriot Mika Biereth. The former Arsenal youngster hit the ground running for Monaco after joining in January, and made his senior international bow against Portugal in March.",
      "It was Biereth, not Hojlund, who partnered Kasper Dolberg up front in the Lithuania friendly. The 22-year-old wasted little time finding the net for the first time at senior international level, scoring the first of five Danish goals, and came in for praise post-match as compatriot Hojlund got a reminder of the challenge ahead.",

      "\"Try to think about how many times we have sat with a Danish national team and said: 'We are missing players, when will some strikers come?',\" Riemer told Viaplay (via Tipsbladet). \"We have so many young players, some of them may be just young enough to break through, but how great is it that we have so many knocking on the door – I think that is important to say.\"",

      "Gyokeres starred for Sporting over the past two campaigns, and scored twice as many goals as any other player in last season's Primeira Liga. He is one of two men high on Arsenal's shipping list, along with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, as Mikel Arteta's team chases an elusive title after three successive runner-up finishes.",
      "Arsenal can offer the former Coventry City hotshot a chance to play for a Champions League contender, with Arteta having led his team to the semi-finals last season. Premier League rivals United can't match that, but they could yet tempt Gyokeres with a reunion with former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim in Manchester.",
      "Now, according to Portuguese outlet Record, Gyokeres' representative Hasan Cetinkaya has met with Arsenal's owners. The publication describes the meeting as the start of a \"new phase\" in negotiations and anticipates a formal proposal.",
      "The same outlet makes reference to comments from Sporting president Frederico Varandas that - as of Wednesday morning - a formal offer from Arsenal had yet to arrive. It also points to reports elsewhere on the continent that United remain keen on a deal and have remained in contact with representatives for Gyokeres.",
      "Gyokeres has a significant release clause in his contract, but suitors might not need to meet it despite his impressive return of 54 goals in 52 games this season. Back in April, it was claimed that around £60million should be enough to land the Scandinavian.",

It's alleged the Sweden striker was under the impression a 'gentleman's agreement' would allow him to leave for around £59million this summer.",
      "But after scoring 97 times in 102 appearances for the Lions, it seems Sporting are intent on receiving the full value of his £85m release clause if he's to leave. And it's led to claims Gyokeres will go on strike if needed in order to force through a dream move this summer.",
      "CNN Portugal reported Cetinkaya met with Arsenal's owners on Wednesday in an effort to expedite a deal. The Gunners reportedly sent a delegation to Lisbon last month to discuss a potential move for Sporting's prolific frontman.",

      "It's also suggested that a move to the Emirates Stadium has been Gyokeres' preference \"from the very beginning.\" And it could mean United boss Ruben Amorim, the man who brought him to Portugal from Coventry City, is left out in the cold.",
      "Gyokeres' inner circle have already made it clear they want him to remain in Lisbon. The player's uncle, Chris, revealed at the Taca de Portugal final, where Gyokeres forced extra time before lifting the title, that the family encouraged their star to stick in his current surroundings.",
      "When asked if the family felt a connection to Lisbon, he told Sport.TV: \"Yes, very much. Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "Not only that, but Gyokeres' girlfriend, Ines Aguiar, has also campaigned for him to stick around. According to A Bola, she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to commit to a third season with Sporting despite the swell of transfer interest.",

In Sweden, people work hard during the week and only socialize on the weekends. Here there is more life during the week. They have dinners with friends, a glass of wine on Monday. I like that.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta's side may have left United in their wake after seemingly moving ahead in discussions. Arsenal appear to be intent on making up for last year's shortcomings by signing an elite striker this summer.",
      "Injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus left the club short last season despite calls to add to their forward department. And it left new signing Mikel Merino with the responsibility of leading the line for much of this season.",
      "The Spaniard did well in his makeshift role and scored 10 goals between January and May. However, the Gunners are under no illusion that a more natural talent is required up top, and the benefit of offering Champions League football is a major advantage over United.",
      "The same can be said for United after a record-low finish of 15th in the Premier League. The likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have failed to set the world alight as hoped at Old Trafford, with Amorim now seeking to make his own mark on the squad.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, isn't the only forward target believed to be on Arsenal's radar. The club has been closely linked with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko this summer, with the club's hierarchy seemingly keen on the Slovenia international.",
      "However, recent developments would suggest Gyokeres remains the preferred pick if the Gunners get their way. And it may mean United are left devastated as a direct rival hoovers up one of the most coveted talents on the market."

      "The £62.5million attacker created the most chances during the contest to hand Carlo Ancelotti his first win since leaving Real Madrid for Brazil, following the goalless draw against Ecuador last time out - where the 26-year-old was a second-half introduction.",
      "With Cunha's inspirational performance, Brazil became the only team to qualify for every World Cup tournament since it was formed in 1930.",
      "The Brazil players and the new United attacker will embark on their respective breaks before returning for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will take on Leeds in mid-July, then travel to America for the Premier League Summer Series, where they will play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton before rounding off their preparations at home to Fiorentina.",
      "United supporters will get a first-look at the squad for the upcoming campaign at Old Trafford on August 9 as they look to bounce back from their torrid camping, which saw them finish just three places above the relegation zone.",
      "Speaking about the prospect of working alongside Amorim, Cunha said: \"Talking about him [Amorim] is easy.",
      "\"I think he's a great coach and I wish him nothing but the best.",
      "\"I hope he conquers the world as he did Portugal.",
      "\"God willing, we'll always do our best to help.\"",

      "The first phase of the summer window is now closed, meaning United are not officially able to get deals over the line. The transfer window was open from June 1-10 thanks to the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.",
      "United have already got one deal over the line with Matheus Cunha arriving in a £62.5million move from Wolves. The Brazilian is not the only player to be linked with a move to United, though, but that will have to wait for later in the summer.",
      "The transfer window will open again on June 16 and will remain so until it closes on September 1 until the New Year. For the time being, United have an opportunity to take stock and weigh up what deals they want to complete when the window reopens once again.",
      "It won't just be new signings that United will be focused on this summer, but also players who could leave the club.",
      "United will want to raise funds via player sales in order to reinvest in the squad ahead of next season. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho all spent time away from Old Trafford on loan last season and could all leave on permanent deals this summer.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund could also leave United this summer amid reported interest from Serie A outfit and Champions League finalists Inter Milan.",
      "United are interested in signing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, but will have to wait until the second transfer window to be able to get a deal over the line.",
      "An opening bid worth up to £55millioj from United was rejected by the Bees earlier this month, but the interest in Mbeumo is still there. The Cameroon international has also been heavily linked with Tottenham Hotspur in recent days.",
      "If United can agree a deal with Brentford for Mbeumo to complete a move to Old Trafford later this month, that would certainly kickstart the second transfer window in ideal fashion.",
      "United have been heavily linked with signing a striker for months, and Viktor Gyokeres is one player who has been mentioned regularly at the top of the list.",
      "Gyokeres has a €100million (£84million) release clause in his contract at Sporting Lisbon but is reportedly available for around £60million this summer. The striker has been linked with several of Europe's biggest clubs this summer, many of which have Champions League football as a key selling point going into next season.",
      "United will be aware that convincing Gyokeres to join the club this summer without any European football to offer may be a difficult task. But if the Old Trafford hierarchy can somehow agree a deal, it would certainly be a major boost going into next season.",
      "The goalkeeping department was a regular talking point at United last season. Andre Onana is the first-choice shot-stopper at Old Trafford and has Altay Bayindir as his understudy, but both players have been linked with moves away over the last few months.",
      "It remains to be seen which two goalkeepers United will have going into next season. Tom Heaton could leave the club this summer when his contract expires, although United have confirmed that talks are ongoing over a new deal.",
      "Only Amorim and those within the Old Trafford hierarchy will know what the plans will be for the goalkeeper position going into next season. Only time will tell if United want to sign a new goalkeeper or if they will continue with their current three options for another year."

      "When Manchester United swooped for Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta in August 2023, it goes without saying that they paid over the odds.",
      "In his first and only season at the Italian club, the Dane scored ten goals in 34 appearances across all competitions. It was a respectable return, but it was by no means eye-catching.",
      "However, United made the decision to pay £64million for his signature. The package could still rise to £72m.",
      "United, who had been interested in Harry Kane earlier in the window, were in desperate need of a striker and their search eventually led them to Hojlund. However, they bought potential rather than a finished product.",
      "He arrived at Old Trafford as an incredibly raw 20-year-old who suddenly had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He had been brought in to strengthen an attack that had been too reliant on Marcus Rashford in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "In truth, the jump from being a starting striker at Atalanta to being a starting striker at United was just too big for the Dane at such a young age. With the exception of the injury-prone Anthony Martial, Hojlund did not have anyone he could lean on for guidance or support.",
      "Despite that, he plundered a respectable 16 goals in his maiden season in England, and there was hope he would build on that tally in 2024/25. However, his performances regressed and he scored just ten goals, of which only four were netted in the Premier League.",
      "It further highlighted the feeling that Hojlund should have been signed to perform the role of United's secondary striker. Martial's injury record meant the Denmark international immediately had to step up and shoulder United's goalscoring burden.",
      "\"He is not good enough. He is lacking in confidence and belief and he is not surrounded by brilliance either.",
      "\"If people think they can fix that in one summer, it is not going to happen.\"",
      "Since making that admission after United were beaten 1-0 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge almost four weeks ago, United have learnt of interest from Inter Milan in Hojlund's signature. United are prepared to sell any player this summer and the striker is one of the more likely candidates to be moved on to raise funds for new additions.",
      "Whether Hojlund stays or goes, United desperately want to recruit a new No.9 this summer. Despite originally targeting Liam Delap, there is a need for them to recruit someone who is an established goalscorer and ready to hit the ground running.",
      "Much of the current speculation centres around Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and Napoli striker Victor Osimhen. Both are proven goalscorers who have hit brilliant numbers in recent seasons.",
      "It is a striker of that ilk that United need to be signing this summer, as opposed to another striker in the bracket of Hojlund, who was recruited based on potential.",
      "Keane was right that Hojlund should have been signed to provide competition and not be the frontman of United's attack. This summer it feels almost inevitable that United will go down the right route when trying to bring in a No.9."

      "There’s a new whisper around Liverpool’s pursuit of a forward, while Manchester City are set to beat Arsenal and Villa to an in-demand Scandinavian…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nSince Newcastle are selfishly refusing to sell them Alexander Isak, the PSG forward is said to be next on the Reds’ list.  Bayern Munich are also keen on Barcola.",
      "",
      "19) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Chelsea\nYou could substitute Chelsea for Liverpool at any point here while discussing the rumours around Ekitike. Both clubs are interested but each have the same problem: Eintracht Frankfurt and their insistence on £85million.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea are being weird here. They wanted Maignan in for the Club World Cup but refused to pay more than £10-12million, only just over half the price Milan want to sell the France no.1. Now the Blues can’t take him to USA, they don’t want him at all. That makes such little sense that it probably isn’t as dead as Chelsea want us to believe.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Manchester United\nOsimhen apparently fancies a move to Old Trafford, presumably because he’s seen the salaries United have been dishing out in recent years. Napoli want around £70million, though they may take Joshua Zirkzee in part-exchange. This one doesn’t pass the sniff test, unless we get to late in the window with all parties in the same position they are now.",

      "",
      "15) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. Which doesn’t seem likely any time soon..",

      "",
      "14) Heung-min Son – Tottenham Hotspur to Al-Hilal\nThe Saudi Arabian club are desperate to make a statement signing and the Spurs captain could be perfect. He’s out of contract next summer, and Son admitted on Tuesday that his future is far from certain.",
      "",
      "13) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered. So Pope might be happy to hear that the two clubs are some way off an agreement with Burnley said to be asking for £40million.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Oleksandr Zinchenko – Arsenal to AC Milan\nZinchenko has been surplus to requirements for some time and with a year remaining on his contract, Arsenal are motivated to sell. One problem: his fat salary is too rich for Milan’s taste. If they can overcome that obstacle, this definitely fits.",
      "",
      "11) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Tottenham Hotspur\nThe Cherries reportedly want £70m, which feels unrealistic. A transfer still feels inevitable and Man United, Liverpool and Spurs have all been linked and Londoners are the favourites.",
      "",
      "10) 🆕 Wilfried Ndidi – Leicester to Manchester United\nThe Nigeria midfielder has a £9million release clause and United see him as a good value squad addition to bolster their midfield options, especially if they sell Casemiro this summer. Which makes sense. Everton and the Saudis are also sniffing.",
      "",
      "9) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker had overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack after much deliberation on the Gunners’ part. But perhaps they hadn’t accounted for how much of a slog it would be to negotiate with RB Leipzig, who are refusing to accept anything under their £70million valuation. As is their right. Especially when Al-Hilal seem keen to cough up if Sesko can be convinced to move to Saudi.",
      "",
      "8) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Sporting say they haven’t received any offers and they also insist that reports of a gentleman’s agreement for him to leave for £59million are b*llocks. Which Gyokeres disputes. This could get messy.",
      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTottenham’s renewed interest threatened to scupper United’s hopes of landing Mbeumo but even the prospect of following Thomas Frank to Spurs isn’t deterring the forward from pursuing a move to Old Trafford. He’ll get his way ‘soon’, apparently.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nChelsea’s improved offer has been swiftly rejected. But a third is expected despite the distraction of the Club World Cup for Chelsea and Dortmund. Gittens is keeping his phone on\n5) Kepa Arrizabalaga – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one was moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million. Interesting one, this. Kepa recovered some credibility on loan at Bournemouth last season and won’t be going to Arsenal just to play second fiddle to David Raya. Bring on the Gunners goalie wars!",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein says it’s done.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool will reportedly pay a British record £126.9m for Wirtz. That’s a lot of wonga. Is Rayan Cherki for a quarter of the price the better transfer? It might just be…",

He later moved to Sporting Gijon, Marseille, Charleroi and Rayo Vallecano (twice) before his untimely passing in 1989, but never again came onto the Three Lions radar.",

      "Man Utd have submitted an offer to sign Viktor Gyokeres as they look to beat Arsenal in the race for the Sporting CP striker, according to reports.",
      "It was understood that the Red Devils would be unlikely to compete with other clubs for Gyokeres this summer after failing to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "However, journalist Ben Jacobs claimed recently that the Sweden international would actually be ‘very keen’ on joining Man Utd without European football next season.",
      "That led to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano giving an update on Tuesday, in which he claimed that Man Utd had made “new contacts” over a possible deal for Gyokeres with the Red Devils “still interested”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "READ: Spend now, sell later? Man Utd could be stuck with bloated bomb squad",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",
      "However, Portuguese journalist Nuno Farinha said on Wednesday that Arsenal are the club Gyokeres “has wanted from the very beginning” and the Gunners are “very advanced” on the transfer.",
      "Farinha revealed on CNN Portugal: “The talks with Arsenal are not new but they have now become more formal since the Gyökeres situation became the situation it was.",
      "“The meeting is currently taking place. Gyökeres’ agent is currently meeting with the owners of Arsenal to try to speed up this process. I don’t know exactly what the amounts are or what amounts are on the table.",
      "“Arsenal is the club that Gyökeres has wanted from the very beginning. Gyökeres wants to play for Arsenal, that’s his desire. He was very open about it to his agent.",
      "“No formal proposal has arrived at Sporting. This time it seems that there will be, because things with Arsenal are already very advanced and it seems to me that there is a great desire to speed up this process. That is why a meeting is taking place at this moment.",
      "“I believe it is in London, which is why I mentioned the issue of British punctuality. Basically, what is important from now on is to understand how this meeting went and how Arsenal will prepare for what we already know is Sporting’s position. €60m plus €10m is out of the question.”",
      "But Portuguese newspaper A Bola claim that Man Utd ‘have not given up’ in the race to sign Gyokeres as Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim is now ‘taking on a very important role’.",
      "And Spanish website Fichajes insist that the Red Devils ‘have decided to take the final step and submit [an] offer’ for Gyokeres after Sporting CP’s ‘stance on his asking price has sparked anger among the striker, who had expected a very different scenario this summer’.",
      "Arsenal have two irons in the fire with the Sweden international and RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, while Man Utd ‘have redoubled their interest in Gyokeres’.",
      "And Romano described Gyokeres as ‘furious’ on Wednesday evening after the Sporting president admitted he wouldn’t be sold for €65m this summer.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Tense situation between Viktor Gyökeres and Sporting. Despite previous pact for exit worth fee around €65m w/add-ons, Sporting president insists on higher fee. Price still under €100m clause but not €65m now. Gyökeres, described as furious.’",
      "Arsenal legend Ray Parlour has chosen a “quick and strong” striker over Sporting CP hero Viktor Gyokeres to improve the Gunners’ forward line.",
      "Former Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sane has revealed why he rejected an offer from Arsenal to move to Galatasaray on a free transfer this summer.",
      "Arsenal are reportedly preparing a ‘formal proposal’ for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres amid issues over a Benjamin Sesko transfer.",
      "Man Utd are set to make a second “formal bid” for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo “imminently” as Viktor Gyokeres pushes for a move, according to reports.",
      "RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko has been ‘advised’ to reject one summer transfer amid interest from Premier League giants Arsenal.",
      "Arsenal are in “very advanced” negotiations with Viktor Gyokeres’ representatives as they look to beat Manchester United in the race to sign the striker."

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Florian Asprilla or Faustino Wirtz?\nHi guys",
      "I think Niall makes some valid points. The only caveat I have is that Arne just won the league with a squad 99% created by Jurgen Klopp. I’m therefore confident that he’ll get it right with the players he wants to add to the squad.",
      "That said, the injury to Bajetic, who I thought might be Gravenberch’s understudy this season, highlights what Niall is saying that we should perhaps be prioritising other positions. If Grav is injured, does that mean our midfield is Mac, Szobo and Wirtz? And do we then bench Frimpong, and play Bradley as the much more defensive right back?",
      "If Kevin Keegan was our manager, I’d be emailing calling the Wirtz deal our Faustino Asprilla moment. As it is, in Arne we trust (but if he changes his mind, we trust then also).\nMichael, LFC, in Hackney",
      "",
      "There was an interesting take from Niall about whether we should be splashing out on Wirtz. Then noticed Football365 already (jokingly?) heating up the Wirtz Vs Cherki debate before its even started with the 10 transfers article.",
      "All this during times when one the one hand its very exciting to be linked with a mega-money signing but there is also the worry about what happens if it all falls through…the worst possible thing… being mocked by rival fans.",
      "I remember well the mocking and jeers at Caicedo chose Chelsea over us.  At the time it was a bit depressing. Going to be honest not that sad about it now though.",
      "I was kind of with Niall that maybe its too much and we shouldn’t be offering so much for one player, but then remembered that was exactly how I felt about Van Dijk, He was too expensive and we had embarrassed ourselves. That worked out pretty well. So I reckon we trust the Liverpool system now and realise they probably know what they are doing. They definitely know more than me about what is worth spending the money on.",
      "Anyway making a team of Dan’s was way trickier than I thought it would be. I realised that Dani Pacheco is 34 now and his breakthrough season is coming.",
      "GK Danny Ward\nRB Danny Alves\nCB Dan Burn\nCB Danilo Luiz da Silva\nLB Danny Rose",

      "Some Subs: Daniel Agger, Dani Carvajal, Danilo(Other one), Danny Mills, Dani Ceballos, Danny Ings, Danny Welbeck\nDan T",
      "",
      "Interesting to see Niall, Annapolis’ take on Liverpool’s move for Florian Wirtz this morning. I’m a United fan so I always have to parse my views on the Scousers’ business and avoid the “hope this goes to shit” lens that can distort my takes.",
      "But even when (I think) I manage to do that, I don’t see this as anything other than an odd departure from Liverpool’s normal modus operandi. The Frimpong and Kerkez deals make perfect sense – signing sorted early in the window, decent value obtained, lots of potential upside and limited exposure.",
      "But paying over £110m for one player, who maybe needs to be accommodated in a number 10 role which hasn’t been an orthodox part of Liverpool’s system for the past decade, looks laden with risk. Maybe this is the beginning of Slot shifting from Klopp’s system having had the good sense to not tear everything up when he first arrived. Maybe the balance between midfield and attack can be tweaked and refined. I wouldn’t assume to know the nuances of top level football well enough to categorically state one or the other.",
      "But in the interests of speculating, it does feel a bit Veron-to-United, or maybe Asprilla-to-Newcastle. A high profile, high quality player being added while in a position of strength, but maybe an unnecessary move that creates a selection issue rather than complementing the existing squad.",
      "To my eyes, that money would be better spent on a striker who gets closer to Firmino’s old levels than Nunez has since he joined.",
      "I could obviously be proven spectacularly wrong. Wirtz might be the centrepiece of a grand plan and maybe they build successfully around him. But as a fan of what should be a rival club, I’m okay-ish with Liverpool planning to spend such a high % of their transfer funds on him. To put it in terms that fans of the other big teams might relate to: I’d feel infinitely more concerned if they were dangling that £110m+ in front of Newcastle and going heavy to get Isak.\nKeith Reilly",
      "",
      "Am I missing something?\nAt the bottom of many of the pages I read on this very fine website a poll is running, ‘Who will win the 2025/26 Premier League title?’ and the current results are shocking, they may have changed but at the time of writing it is as below:",
      "Liverpool – 45%\nArsenal – 21%\nMan City – 14%\nChelsea 5%\nNewcastle – 5%\nOther – 11%",
      "I’m just going to rank these in the order I think the top 4 teams will actually finish next season:",
      "1st. Man City – 14% – Huh?",
      "How has Man City fallen this far in the eyes of the “informed” football public? This is a team that has won 6 out of the last 8 seasons, a team that has beaten record after record consistently since Pep took over, a team that had a manager who had quite a few personal problems to deal with this season and still finish 3rd after a meltdown and missing their best player, the lynch pin of the squad, being out for most of the season.",
      "They started rebuilding in January and have just added more quality players, a lot of people forget how this team was built, to solve problems this City team just spends £50 million on a player, if it doesn’t work out, they buy another £50 million player in the same position, rinse and repeat, look at the saga of left back till Kyle Walker signed. They have been keeping their hand in their pocket for the last couple of seasons (probably due to a 115 reasons) but don’t get this team wrong, they are willing to spend and spend big to get back on their perch.",
      "FFP means nothing to them until a punishment is given and by cementing themselves as too big to fail, the FA are more than likely to just roll over, charge them £100 million and dock them 40 points, they finish 8th – 6th on 60 points that season and then go back to winning ways getting another 3 titles until Pep buggers off and then the clone of Alex Ferguson takes over just to take the piss.",
      "How quick people forget, barring Rodri suffering from PTSD due to his injury, this team will win the title next season, just look at the team. Erling will put his other scoring boots on and get the golden boot by December (its weird that a striker who got 31 goals in 44 appearances is seen as a poor season but he is that good), Rodri is one of only 2 defensive players to win the Ballon d’Or in recent memory (last 20 years), Phil Foden is still quite talented, Cherki and Reijnders are coming, they have a shed load of underage talent (not in the Epstein way) and Ederson is Ederson and always will be Ederson. They’ve even got Oscar Bobb, who you’ve never heard of but he has one premier league medal more than you.",
      "This is Man Cities title to lose, the also rans will just have to wait till Pep goes through another divorce or for FFP to give a points deduction, which ever comes first.",
      "2nd. Liverpool – 45% – Wait, what?",
      "At the start of this season Liverpool people thought we were lucky to make it into the top four, let alone win the thing with 4 games to go. I think Liverpool were criminally underrated due to the unknown of Arnie Slot, the season before they had been trying to get the quady for Klopp and were very close (they still had a chance until the 17/03), the change of manager was the only major thing and for the first half of this season no team could touch them, Liverpool went from a team that was on default tactics on Pro Evo to the dick who spends 40 minutes setting up their team while everyone else sits around getting drunk.",
      "They were more fun under Klopp but they are now scarier, Klopps team were headstrong running though walls, if the wall didn’t go down they would still run until they knocked themselves out, Slots team has learnt to move around the wall, apart from the PSG match which they lost but were incredible in, this team always looked like it could go to another level in a match but usually won without having to do it.",
      "The transfers of Frimpong, Kerkez and Wirtz are statement signings, showing intent to be the next era of football, beating all in their path, sadly, like Klopps team when we bought Allison and Van Dyke, they are coming up against a juggernaut called Man City. A striker will help and Liverpool will push City all the way to the end but they will not beat them, this season wasn’t the start of Man Cities downfall, it was just a blip that happened under extraordinary bad luck, luck they have paid a lot of money to change.",
      "I understand recency bias but nearly half the people who visit this website think Liverpool will win next season, I find that insane, we might be making the right noises but you can’t forget the past, it always bloody repeats itself.",
      "3rd. Arsenal – 21% – Ha!",
      "I don’t want to troll Arsenal fans, some of my best friends are Arsenal fans but 21% HA. This team is youngish, has unbelievable talent and can beat anyone on their day, they have an attack that a Saudi team would pay a billion for and a defence that would get £750 million, they have a lot more strength than a “usual” Arsenal team and have the options to bully or out pass a lot of teams, on football manager this is the team you would want as it’d take a few shrewd signings and some really good half time team talks to be a treble winner.",
      "The problem I’ve found with this Arsenal team is the sense of entitlement, the manager and a vocal minority of the fan base, seem to have, they both have an excuse for every situation and seem to think that they deserve to win it just because they played well for 3 seasons. “If it wasn’t for a red card”, “If we hadn’t had injuries”, “If the wind had blown in a different direction”, “if the season had started at christmas…”, its just excuse after excuse.",
      "When Liverpool were always the bridesmaid they didn’t complain anywhere near the amount as some of these youtube, voice of the fan, cockgobblers and Klopp didn’t whine as much as Arteta does, he’s a sexy man with a sexy wife with a sexy life, why does he always look like someone has pissed on his chips. (Might try and turn that last line into a song)",
      "This unearned arrogance seems to have seeped into the mentality of the team, the strops the players have from time to time are apparent, a card goes against them, a VAR decision is DEFINITELY wrong or a tackle was a bit hard and they down tools, wanting to take the ball home because the beautiful game has been marred because its not the Arsenal way.",
      "If this team got a new manager (hopefully Arteta just moves on when they come third next season so the board don’t look like bad guys when they fire him) they could go from strength to strength, if he hadn’t of managed Tottenham Ange would of been great as long as he wasn’t allowed near the tactics, his infectious personality and will to win while also admitting when they are shit was a breath of fresh air and if it had been at Arsenal you could see a completely different player mentality.",
      "Another reason for my reaction is that they haven’t won anything, don’t bring up that bloody FA Cup, they are always near but in the final part of a season/cup they just fall away because they thought they’d already won it, this season would of been hilarious if Man City had got up to second, another “How does Arsenal come 3rd in a 2 horse race?” would of turned them into the new Spurs and who wouldn’t want Arsenal to turn into the new Spurs.",
      "4th.  Aston Villa – 0% (or 11% with other) – Why not?",
      "Its not about Aston Villa being better, its about Aston Villa having less intense games to deal with, the Europa Cup, while fun, isn’t anywhere near as taxing as Champs League, Newcastle are still paper thin having a lot of the same back up players they had in the championship, Chelsea are still young and while they could become amazing, I can also see this becoming the norm around European match time, resting players for the wednesday, losing, playing on the wednesday, losing and then because the teams knackered they lose on the following Saturday, having 3 loses in a row which is a heavy hit to the mentality of a young team.",
      "Man United are still rebuilding from the last rebuild, Tottenham are Tottenham and will forever be Tottenham, Forest may make an upset but its a long season, they will more than likely do what they did this season and sadly fall away. Brighton could get in there, they have a great squad which is constantly being pillaged by the bigger boys, if they can keep them this season and not having any European football its on the card (what a weird sentence, Brighton being a top four team)",
      "Aston Villa has become a team to be reckoned with, we’ve seen what they can do with a competent manager and a team of battle hardened machines that know what they need to do, add a bit of flair into this team and this is a no brainer.",

      "There’s a fairly solid evidence base that he bears some culpability for the repeated and identical injuries that their defenders have suffered, not merely in terms of the high line system that they play, but also in terms of his somewhat antediluvian training methods.",
      "And that’s not even talking about how common it is for players to break down immediately on return from injury, which leads one to believe that he may be rushing them back too early from their rehabilitation.",

      "Ange was a realist. He accepted the situation he was in, where the odds were stacked against him-the players ability (Son was the only world class talent), consistency, cohesion and motivation to win games,support from management was highly depleted-eventually leading him to the transparent conclusion that a league triumph was impossible but the euro cup was achievable. This gamble was made despite the consequences of league defeats to inferior opposition while playing with an (apparently) uninspiring style of football but the cup win was worth it(you could see the happiness of spurs fans despite enduring a bad league season and the subsequent drama in football it brought, like arsenal assuming the mantle of the ‘spursy’ team of the season).",

      "“It is simple. To do something, we need to sell players.”",
      "Ruben Amorim there, acknowledging publicly in February what he must have been saying behind closed doors for three months prior to that. Since then, his resolve to make major changes at Old Trafford can only have strengthened in the wake of United’s worst season in living memory, their wretched failures making it more imperative that the Red Devils finally learn how to sell.",
      "Amorim has commenced his rebuild, paying £62million to get Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Man Utd will probably spend a similar sum on Bryan Mbeumo. Given the chance, Amorim might drop the same again on Viktor Gyokeres. All of which will make Man Utd a lot more fun to watch. But vibes won’t pay their bills.",
      "The club’s financial situation is perhaps not as perilous as Sir Jim Ratcliffe might want us to believe while Man Utd go through another round of layoffs. It was thought that Amorim might have just shy of £100million to spend in the summer market before he had to raise funds through sales. Any two of the three aforementioned forwards would take Man Utd well over that budget.",
      "So it’s time to sell, sell, sell. Something they are notoriously bad at. And the early signs suggest they are yet to catch on.",
      "The Telegraph gave an insight into United’s sales strategy only last month. Apparently, the Red Devils believed they could rake in £90million by selling Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony.",
      "At best, that was wishful thinking. At worst, another sign of the delusion and incompetence that has made Man Utd one of the biggest patsies in the European game.",
      "United’s best hope with Sancho was they were dealing with Chelsea. If the Blues won’t do that deal, who will? Who is going to pay serious money for a barely-arsed big name, one with another year left on a massive contract who everyone knows Man Utd want shot of?",
      "It is a similar story with Rashford. An unwanted, disinterested player on a huge salary. Any club tempted to give the England forward a fresh start would be daft to offer Man Utd anything more than the loan-first deal Villa initially agreed to then refused to follow through on.",
      "Antony might be a more straightforward sale. Yes, at a price to shame United’s recruiters again but and even while offering a £60million hit, there is hardly a clamour, despite the Brazilian showing some signs of life at Real Betis.",
      "Rather than bank £90million to put towards a rebuild, more likely is that two, maybe all three, will once more be loaned out, only after they have sulked around Carrington for some or much of pre-season, before Man Utd accept liability for significant portions of their salary.",
      "That reality appears to have dawned on Man Utd if there’s any truth in the report that they have sought to fill some of that black hole by increasing their asking price for one of their more sellable assets.",
      "However, we can only assume whomever forecasted a £90million deposit for their loan exiles also priced Alejandro Garnacho at £70million. Because that’s an equally nonsensical figure.",
      "Garnacho is no more wanted than Sancho, Rashford, Antony. Less so, perhaps, given Amorim is more familiar with his flaws than the others’. And any club who might take a chance on the Argentina international knows it.",
      "“You better pray that you can find a club to sign you,” Garnacho was told by Amorim during the Bilbao inquest. And, sure, it will serve the player to be elsewhere next season. But Man Utd ought to be the party dropping to their knees. Without divine intervention, they have no hope of raking in £70million for the maddeningly-inconsistent winger.",
      "Chelsea and Arsenal have both been linked with Garnacho, but both have cheaper, arguably better alternatives. Napoli, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all interested, are they? Not at that price, not while United’s desire to be rid of Garnacho is so well documented.",
      "To furnish Amorim with the bare minimum he needs to jumpstart the Man Utd juggernaut on the road to credibility, the Red Devils must at least double the £100million they started with. Selling the four-man bomb squad is unlikely to achieve that, let alone rake in the £160million they anticipated.",
      "Who else could Man Utd take to market? Bruno Fernandes scuppered whatever plans the club may have had to cash in on their captain. Many Man Utd fans, including Gary Neville, would be loathe to see Kobbie Mainoo sold to the highest bidder but the homegrown midfielder is one of few others over whom Man Utd could negotiate from a position of authority.",
      "For the vast majority of Amorim’s squad, certainly those he wants rid of, it is a buyer’s market. And before long, a borrower’s one.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed the precise chances that a Manchester United man joins Chelsea, as he has reiterated that the star ‘will leave’ the club.",
      "United could allow a number of their first-team players to leave this summer. A number of attacking players have been linked with the exit.",
      "Last season’s loan departures Marcus Rashford and Antony are both likely to leave – the former permanently and the latter potentially on another loan.",
      "Fellow forwards Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho are also each being linked with exits.",
      "Garnacho was reportedly told by Ruben Amorim that his United career was over, the boss apparently saying: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "Since then, insider Romano has stated the winger will be leaving. He has reiterated that to DAZN, while stating Garnacho ‘could stay in England’ and placing the chances of him landing at interested side Chelsea at a ’35 per cent chance’.",
      "What calculations have gone into that percentage are unclear. But it is evident that Garnacho would like to head to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It was reported at the beginning of June that the winger had told his agent to make it clear that he wanted to play for Chelsea next.",
      "There will seemingly be chances for him to move out of England too, though.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen are linked, as are Napoli and Atletico Madrid, so there are three potential leagues there. Elsewhere, it’s been reported that Cristiano Ronaldo has demanded Al-Nassr sign Garnacho during contract negotiations.",
      "It’s believed Garnacho is on the radar of the Saudi Pro League side as a result of Ronaldo’s demand, but it’s not clear if they would be able to sign him.",
      "It would be a step backwards for a player to leave United for a move to Saudi Arabia at just 20 years of age.",
      "But Ronaldo is an idol of Garnacho’s, and he got to play just six games with him at United, so there might be a chance that he’d be willing to move to play with him for a period, knowing there’s a lot of time left in his career to go elsewhere.",
      "A rant from Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘weakened’ the negotiating position of Manchester United for one of their players, meaning his value might have dropped by £20million.",
      "Man Utd have to get busy with new signings but confidence in their ability to raise money through sales seems as woefully misplaced as ever.",
      "Man Utd legend Cristiano Ronaldo ‘demanded’ that Al-Nassr signed Alejandro Garnacho this summer during his contract negotiations, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are among the clubs interested in signing Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Chelsea.",
      "According to reports, a ‘decision’ has been made on Alejandro Garnacho as he ‘will leave’ Premier League giants Manchester United this summer.",
      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally."

      "It was thought that Gyokeres would not entertain the idea of leaving Sporting for Man Utd in the summer after Ruben Amorim’s side failed to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "But journalist Ben Jacobs revealed that the Sweden international would actually be “very keen” on a move to Old Trafford, regardless of them not being in Europe next term.",
      "Before transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave an update on Tuesday and claimed that Man Utd “called again” about Gyokeres as they keep “informed” on his situation.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "READ: Top 10 wingers available this summer features Arsenal, Liverpool targets and Man Utd outcast",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",
      "Some Man Utd fans have been excited at the prospect of Gyokeres leading the line next season but club legend Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils should avoid the signing.",
      "Ferdinand was joined on his YouTube channel by host Joel Beya and former Man City defender Joleon Lescott as they discussed Gyokeres’ potential transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Beya declared: “Gyokeres, you’ve got to go for him.” To which Lescott swiftly said: “I believe that you’re going to go for him – but he’s not the guy.”",
      "Ferdinand replied: “I don’t think he’s the guy. I’ve not watched him loads [but] I’ve watched him probably three times really, really closely.",
      "“And three times I’ve gone, ‘He ain’t getting that opportunity in the Prem’. When I see him physically matched, what else is there?",
      "“Is there enough – after he’s physically matched – to get him a goal?”",
      "Lescott added: “You don’t get away with that in the Prem.”",
      "A report on Tuesday in Portugal insisted that Gyokeres is ‘furious’ after Sporting apparently broke a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to sell him for €70m (£59m) in the summer.",
      "It had reportedly been ‘agreed’ that his €100m would ‘not be an obstacle’ for a summer transfer and that Gyokeres ‘could leave if Sporting received a concrete offer of €60 million, plus €10 million depending on objectives’.",
      "But Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas has rejected those claims and insisted that Gyokeres “will not leave” for €70m this summer.",
      "Varandas said: “I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that. To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres – neither today nor last season.”",
      "The Sporting president added: “One of the agent’s biggest concerns was whether we would demand the termination clause.",
      "“He wanted to guarantee certain things. And what was agreed? That Sporting would not demand a release clause now.",
      "“For one reason: he was going to be 27 years old and no player leaves Portugal at 27 for 100m eurors or 90m euros.",
      "“In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: ‘It’s not worth us setting a value because I don’t know what will happen in a year’s time. I don’t know if it will be 40m euros, 60m euros or 80m euros. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million euros.”",

      "Manchester United have entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, according to Sky Germany.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea are also thought to be interested in the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal.",
      "It is understood United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for Ekitike with Frankfurt demanding around £85m (€100m).",
      "United are in the market for a striker after the arrival of Wolves' Matheus Cunha and the potential signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Chelsea and Liverpool considered among the next landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Read more about Hugo Ekitike's rise",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers."

      "Thursday 12 June 2025 23:14, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 10:08, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",

      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",

      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",

      "Man Utd and Lisandro Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since he underwent surgery four months ago; defender is on an individual programme as he works to return to fitness after being stretchered off against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in February",
      "Saturday 7 June 2025 17:24, UK",
      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
