      "Rio Ferdinand has heaped praise on Manchester United's in-form forward Bryan Mbeumo - labelling the £71million star \"a joke\".",
      "Signed in the summer from Brentford, the Cameroon international has stepped up to the plate for United since his big-money move to Old Trafford, emerging as the chief goal threat in Ruben Amorim's expensively-assembled new look attack. While Benjamin Sesko has taken time to settle and Matheus Cunha has impressed with his all-round game and work ethic, Mbeumo has registered six goals and an assist in his opening 12 games. He was named the Premier League's player of the month for October, at a time where United have gone five games unbeaten in all competitions.",
      "Former United defender Ferdinand was asked to name the club’s most important player right now on his YouTube podcast and was quick to highlight how impressed he has been with the 26-year-old.",
      "\"Mbeumo has been a joke,\" said Ferdinand. \"He’s really stepped in there and become a mainstay. He’s someone who can give you two or three seconds on the ball to relieve pressure. He can score important goals and create chances.",
      "\"I saw Thomas Frank’s comments about him the other day and Mbeumo nearly being a complete winger.",
      "\"I think by the end of this season, he’ll be one of the most complete wingers in the Premier League because he can do everything. He just needs to consistently do it in a United shirt.\"",
      "Mbeumo was not the only player Ferdinand praised, with both Matthijs de Ligt and new goalkeeper Senne Lammens having impressed the ex-England centre-back.",
      "\"You can’t talk about anyone being our most important player without mentioning the goalkeeper,\" added Ferdinand. \"It’s no coincidence we’ve had an upturn in form. We’ve got a goalkeeper that it seems all the players trust.\"",
      "On the subject of De Ligt, who was at United last term but after issues with form and fitness has been an ever-present this term, playing every minute thus far, Ferdinand added: \"I think Matthijs de Ligt has been our best defender this season, he’s been outstanding for us.",
      "\"He’s even adding goals – with the last-minute one the other day [against Tottenham].",
      "\"His pressing, his assertiveness and his willingness to go into foreign areas up the pitch to defend at the right times has been good. Clearing out of the box, he has been brilliant.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes that Manchester United's upturn in form is in part down to Senne Lammens fine start to life at Old Trafford after wrestling the No.1 jersey away from Altay Bayindir.",
      "The young shot-stopper was signed as an unknown quantity in the summer when the Red Devils were assessing their options between the sticks, with chief goalkeeping scout Tony Coton pushing for the move. Andre Onana came into the year with question marks over him whilst Bayindir had also not convinced. Onana was surprisingly let go, heading to Turkey on loan, and Ruben Amorim turned to Lammens.",
      "The Belgian has impressed, keeping a clean sheet on his debut against Sunderland and also helping the team end their wait for a win at Anfield. United are now unbeaten in their last five games, winning three and drawing two, with Ferdinand admitting the change of goalkeeper has bought a confidence to the team that hadn't existed beforehand.",
      "He said on his YouTube channel: \"You can’t talk about anyone being our most important player without mentioning the goalkeeper. It’s no coincidence we’ve had an upturn in form. We’ve got a goalkeeper that it seems all the players trust.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was another summer signing, joining from Brentford, and he's settled in seamlessly with Ferdinand declaring him one of the league's best wingers.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt was on hand to score a stoppage time equaliser for United as they salvaged a point at Tottenham. The Dutchman was by no means convincing in his first year but has emerged as a defensive leader.",

      "Manchester United could be facing a significant blow with Benjamin Sesko potentially sidelined for crucial upcoming matches, even if his knee injury proves to be minor. The 22-year-old striker picked up the knock in the final moments of last weekend's 2-2 stalemate against Tottenham.",
      "With all substitutions already made by boss Ruben Amorim, United were left a man down for the final minutes. Spurs seemed poised to capitalise on this when Richarlison deftly redirected a Wilson Odobert shot past United's keeper Senne Lammens, only for Matthijs de Ligt to net a dramatic equaliser at the eleventh hour.",
      "Injuries took centre stage at Ruben Amorim's post-match press conference, though. After confirming problems for Harry Maguire and Casemiro, Amorim expressed concern over Sesko, saying: \"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see.\"",
      "While Sesko is expected to stay at Carrington during the November international break, sources suggest the injury may not be as severe as initially thought. Slovenia's manager Matjaz Kek, however, wants his country's medical team to examine Sesko before the year's final international break gets underway.",
      "As quoted by Epika, Kek stated: \"We want the player to be examined by our medical service. Our doctor is an expert in this field.",
      "\"Of course I'm worried about the player, the only thing I'm interested in is his well-being, we're ready to do everything for that and we've never sent anyone onto the field if there was the slightest risk.",
      "\"But the national team is something very special and I expect maximum respect from everyone. Slovenia deserves that, even if there's a superpower like England on the other side, and something as exceptional as the Premier League.\"",
      "Despite having more than a fortnight to rest, given United don't return to league duties until Monday, November 24 against Everton, Sesko remains doubtful for selection.",
      "Amorim's squad travel to Crystal Palace that weekend before hosting West Ham United just four days later. A rehabilitation timeframe of slightly over three weeks would mean Sesko sitting out all of those fixtures.",
      "After that, another quick succession of matches awaits United in mid-December as they clash with Wolves on Monday, December 8 before welcoming Bournemouth to Old Trafford just a few days later.",
      "The hectic festive period then kicks in with Amorim likely eager to have Sesko fit and available, particularly with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad departing for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "During that spell, United face Aston Villa, Newcastle United, Wolves, Leeds United and Burnley across just 17 days. A serious knee injury could rule Sesko out of all those encounters, though optimism remains that he might return before the month's end.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester City will never be able to trump Liverpool or Manchester United as the biggest club in the country - even if they win more trophies, claims Jamie Carragher.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have enjoyed a meteoric rise over the past two decades, owing largely to their takeover, which has seen their global standing go through the roof. Domestically they have established themselves as the dominant force. But despite that Carragher claims they will never be able to surpass the country's two biggest teams and doubts whether any of their rivalries could ever leapfrog some of the more historical match-ups we've had in this country.",
      "City's rise has seen their rivalry with United heighten whilst their clashes with Liverpool have often proved to be title-defining and been regarded as some of the highest quality matches we've seen. Carragher though maintains that the Reds vs United will always be the country's greatest contest.",
      "He said: \"Manchester City will never be bigger than Manchester United. And Liverpool vs Man City will never be bigger than Liverpool vs Man United. That just won’t happen, it can’t happen. Historically, Liverpool and Manchester United will always be the biggest two clubs in this country. I don’t think that will ever change.",
      "\"It’s very difficult for teams who come later. It’s almost set in stone who the huge clubs are. They [City] may end up having more trophies and league titles if they carry on winning and if United keep not being in the shout for trophies, but it’s difficult to see any club in this country ever being above Liverpool or Manchester United in terms of size and stature.\"",
      "Carragher's comments come three years after he did indeed declare City vs Liverpool as the \"greatest rivalry in English history\". Albeit there is a difference between great and big, something he could make a clear distinction on.",
      "He had said: “Liverpool versus Manchester City has become the greatest, most intense and highest quality rivalry in English football history. There is a uniqueness to it. This is the first time the two best teams in England are the two best teams in the world, led by the two greatest coaches of their generation.\"",
      "In terms of outright silverware Liverpool currently lead the way having lifted 70 trophies. That included twenty titles and six European Cups - more than any of their English counterparts. United are narrowly below having won 68 trophies in total.",
      "City's rapid progress means that they are now the joint-fourth-most successful in English history. While Arsenal are a clear third with 49 trophies, but those from the blue half of Manchester have drawn level with Chelsea on 36.",

      "Ruben Amorim has much to ponder heading into the international break, but one squad concern at Manchester United is larger than the rest. And one portion of the dressing room, in particular, has its work cut out for it in making improvements over the next fortnight or so.",
      "Amorim's side scraped a point at Tottenham on Saturday after failing to hold onto the lead Bryan Mbeumo opened up in north London. As such, United's porous defensive record persisted, with the team having kept just one clean sheet in 12 outings so far this term.",
      "Whereas scoring goals has been the primary concern for United in recent campaigns, it's painfully obvious this season's main issues lie in defence. Avoidable errors at the back have become an unwanted hallmark of the team this term and were once again on display against Spurs.",
      "Summer signing Senne Lammens has been an upgrade between the posts and can't be blamed for the downpour in goals conceded. Instead, that responsibility lies mostly with those in defence and certain midfielders, who have failed to show the necessary calm in crucial moments.",
      "Manuel Ugarte was partly at fault in both of Tottenham's goals this weekend. The Uruguayan first allowed Wilson Odobert to breeze past him too easily before helping to tee up Mathys Tel's equaliser. He then had a hand in keeping Richarlison onside for their go-ahead goal.",
      "And while Mathijs de Ligt may have salvaged a point thanks to his 96th-minute equaliser, he too had some forgettable moments. Chief among those was looking too passive in allowing Tel to turn and shoot yards from Lammens' goal for the leveller.",
      "They're far from alone, given the likes of Patrick Dorgu, Diogo Dalot, Leny Yoro, and Casemiro have each displayed weakness in defence over recent weeks. United sit seventh in the Premier League but have conceded 18 goals, a tally beaten only by the bottom five teams in the table.",
      "While the signings of Mbeumo (the Premier League's Player of the Month for October), Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have improved matters in attack, bringing the defence up to par if the next port of call. And while any issues won't be solved entirely over the international break, it's the ideal opening to at least make changes that will matter in the long haul.",
      "Amid United's search for a new robust midfielder in the summer of 2024, Amadou Onana was one of those touted for a move to Old Trafford. The Belgium international had spent two seasons impressing for Everton and levelled up by joining Unai Emery's Aston Villa for £50million that July.",
      "And it's now become clear exactly why the Villans were so eager to sew up their agreement so swiftly. That's after Onana's sister and agent, Melissa, gave a look behind the curtain regarding United's interest and why he opted for Villa Park instead.",
      "\"Aston Villa's sporting project was crystal clear,\" she told Belgian journalist Sacha Tavolieri (via Walfoot). \"It was a project where Amadou could continue to develop. We spoke with the sporting director, and the salary was also attractive, let’s not kid ourselves.\"",
      "She continued: \"The Euros were coming up, Amadou was performing well, and we finalised the deal. Then, Manchester United entered the picture. But I had already given my word to Aston Villa.",
      "\"We knew very well that Manchester would be able to offer better financial terms, but we had already given our word to Aston Villa, and the project was a good fit. The style of football played, the club’s ambition: Amadou felt right at home there.\"",
      "It wasn't until the final days of Erik ten Hag's transfer window at Old Trafford that United finally signed Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain. A little more than one year later, Villa's outlay to sign Onana is looking like money well spent, whereas the jury is still out on the similar fee forked out to recruit Ugarte.",

      "Manchester United may be forced to delve into the January transfer market for a new striker after Benjamin Sesko was sidelined with a knee injury during Saturday's 2-2 draw against Tottenham.",
      "Sesko, who came on as a substitute in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, could only manage half an hour before he had to be helped off the pitch following treatment for a knee issue. The Red Devils were left a man short for the remainder of the match as manager Ruben Amorim had already made all his substitutions.",
      "On Monday, United confirmed that Sesko would not be joining up with his national team for Slovenia's upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden. Instead, the 23-year-old will stay put at Carrington for further assessment this week.",
      "Although insiders suggest the injury isn't considered too serious, there are whispers that United might consider bringing in another centre forward when the January transfer window swings open.",
      "Should United decide to bolster their attacking options, one name that could be in the frame is Ivan Toney. The England international has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for some time, and this could be the ideal opportunity for him to make the switch.",
      "Toney, now 29, has been plying his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al-Ahli for the past 15 months, having signed for them in August 2024. During his stint in the Middle East, he's netted an impressive 41 goals and provided eight assists in 59 appearances.",
      "With Toney having scored 11 goals in just 15 matches this season, it seems he has some unfinished business in the Premier League. He previously dazzled for three years at Brentford, where he netted 36 goals in 83 top-tier games between 2021 and 2024.",
      "The former Northampton and Peterborough player was a key figure in a Brentford attack that also included United's Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Mbeumo and Toney were teammates in west London for four years, helping to establish the Bees as a Premier League club. They formed a formidable partnership on the pitch, with Toney and Mbeumo scoring or assisting each other 16 times during that period.",
      "Although Mbeumo is set to miss part of January due to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), he could reignite his special relationship with Toney at United upon his return. Even if Sesko's absence isn't long-term, Toney would provide United with another attacking option and potentially pave the way for Joshua Zirkzee to leave the club after struggling for game time.",
      "A front three of Mbeumo on the right, Toney in the centre and Matheus Cunha on the left could prove devastating for United and Amorim in the second half of the season.",
      "Toney, who is valued at around £40million and has two-and-a-half years remaining on his Al-Ahli contract, will turn 30 in March. This could prompt United to try and negotiate a lower price and persuade him to make the move.",

      "United were left with 10 men after Sesko hobbled off less than 30 minutes after he was introduced as a substitute. There had been suggestions that the club could be forced to move for a striker in the January transfer window if Sesko was sidelined for a prolonged period.",
      "Speaking after the match, Ruben Amorim said the Slovenian had picked up a knee injury and was due to undergo further testing. The 22-year-old had been due to link up with the Slovenia squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden.",
      "However, the injury has spoiled the chances of him featuring for his country - much to the annoyance of manager Matjaz Kek. His withdrawal had some United supporters fearing the worst, but there are now hints that the injury may not be as bad as first feared.",
      "ESPN reports that United are 'confident' that Sesko won't be sidelined for a significant period. But they will await the results of further tests for a more detailed diagnosis ahead of their next match against Everton on November 24.",
      "Sesko has contributed two goals and one assist in 12 appearances for United so far this season following his £74million transfer from RB Leipzig in the summer. Amorim has used him off the bench as an impact substitute, as well as from the start of matches.",
      "While the feeling at Carrington is a positive one, there was a very different reaction from Slovenia boss Kek, who was desperate for Sesko's services in the World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo on Saturday and Sweden on November 18.",
      "\"With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents,\" said Kek on Monday. \"We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don't have just anyone in this position.",

United haven't contacted anyone from our camp. Of course, I am concerned about the player; the only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing.",

      "Manchester United are set to take advantage of a much-needed international break, allowing their injured players some recovery time before they return to Premier League action. The Red Devils' injury list grew even longer on Saturday, with Benjamin Sesko, Casemiro and Harry Maguire all forced off the pitch during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham.",
      "Sesko replaced Noussair Mazraoui just 59 minutes into United's stalemate with Spurs on Saturday, but was later seen limping off the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium pitch with a suspected knee injury, leaving the Red Devils to finish the game with 10 men.",
      "Potential return date: Unknown",
      "Casemiro was withdrawn for Manuel Ugarte just over 10 minutes after Sesko came on for Mazraoui, with Amorim seemingly indicating he couldn't carry on due to an issue. Given Amorim hasn't revealed much about the experienced midfielder, his substitution may not be a major worry.",
      "Potential return date: November 24 against Everton (H).",
      "Maguire was brought off at the same time as Casemiro with a suspected hamstring injury, with Leny Yoro coming on for the final 20 minutes. Speaking after the game, Amorim said: \"With everything that happened, Harry has to come out, Casemiro has to come out and Ben.\"",
      "However, reports suggest Maguire's problem isn't too serious, and he could be back for United's encounter with Everton at the end of the month.",
      "Potential return date: November 24 against Everton (H).",
      "Mainoo didn't feature in Amorim's matchday squad against Tottenham, and wasn't seen travelling with his teammates on the train to the capital on Friday. According to The Athletic, a minor injury kept him out of the fixture, suggesting he should be available when Premier League football resumes.",
      "Potential return date: November 24 against Everton (H).",
      "United supporters have been eagerly awaiting the return of Martinez, who has been sidelined since February due to a severe knee injury. He's now back in training at Carrington, and it's reported that he's been given the green light to train with Argentina during the international break to regain match fitness.",
      "However, it might still be a bit premature for him to make a competitive appearance, particularly as Amorim has noted that the centre-back is 'going to take time' to reach match readiness.",

The training ground's home has been at Carrington since January 2000, when they left their longstanding base, The Cliff, to move into a facility that cost £14.3m to build.",

      "Spurs appeared to have secured a win with Thomas Frank's side 2-1 up with seconds left to play after Mathys Tel and Richarlison cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal. However, De Ligt found space at the back post from a late corner to secure a share of the spoils for the away team.",
      "United's head coach has recently been praised following an upturn in form which has seen them go on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League, lifting them up to seventh in the table. But former United goalkeeper Ben Foster believes there is still room for improvement if they want to achieve a top-four finish after comparing them unfavourably with local rivals Manchester City.",
      "\"They look like they're playing with a lot more confidence than they have done for most of this season,\" the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper told talkSPORT. \"But I just think when you contrast it with the quality of Man City, for example, it's very evident there's still quite a way to go.\"",
      "When asked by presenter Jeff Stelling about their hopes of breaking into the top four, Foster said: \"I just think it's too competitive, I really do. There's probably a dozen teams in the Premier League who can realistically beat anybody on a Saturday.",
      "\"Even if you go down to the likes of Brighton, Bournemouth and Sunderland, you just don't know what you're going to get. They [United] should be aiming for the top four but whether that's a realistic target or not, it is just so hard to call.\"",
      "Despite his cautious prediction, Foster reckons the Red Devils have stepped up a gear under Amorim following a poor start to the season. He also suggested that the United team are now buying into the former Sport Lisbon manager's methods.",
      "Foster added: \"We're seeing it all over the Premier League that putting a string of games together where you're winning consistently is really hard to do.",
      "\"Sometimes you just have to make sure you don't lose. For Manchester United, they would have lost that game earlier in the season. They wouldn't have had it about them to go and really search for that equaliser. I think it's a mentality shift in the players.",

      "\"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see,\" the Portuguese said. \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",

      "And while Tuchel has included the likes of Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Jarrod Bowen in his camp, Rooney has been left scratching his head at the decision to exclude Watkins. Speaking to the BBC in the aftermath of Villa's 4-0 thumping of Bournemouth on Sunday, the Manchester United legend said: \"That was really good from Villa today.",
      "\"Unai Emery manages his squad so well with playing in Europe and he has so much experience of playing Sunday-Thursday. It showed today with the way they came out against Bournemouth so full of energy.",

      "\"I am slightly surprised Thomas Tuchel has left Ollie Watkins out of the England squad. He played very well today, had a few chances and was unlucky not to get a goal. His work rate was excellent.\"",
      "It comes after Watkins was forced to withdraw from the England squad last month after picking up an injury during the nation's 3-0 friendly win over Wales. Watkins scored the second goal of that game, but left the pitch at half-time after colliding with a post.",
      "Despite Tuchel dubbing the striker as \"okay\" in the aftermath of the game, Watkins ultimately returned to Villa to continue his recovery process. It's been a testing term for the 29-year-old thus far, who has only managed one goal from 11 outings in the Premier League with the Villains thus far.",
      "The club, meanwhile, sit sixth in the Premier League standings with five wins, three draws and as many losses to show for their efforts, with Emery able to turn around a lacklustre start to the season which saw them go without a single victory in their opening five outings.",

      "The Slovenian striker, who came on as a substitute against Spurs at the weekend, was forced off after less than half an hour. United medical staff treated him, with boss Ruben Amorim suggesting that the Slovenian had picked up a knee injury and was due to undergo further testing.",
      "With the international break on the horizon, Slovenia boss Kek wanted Sesko's services to call upon, but has had no update from United officials as of yet. It is understood that he won't be available for their World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden in the coming weeks.",
      "\"With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents,\" said Kek.",
      "\"We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don't have just anyone in this position.",
      "\"I cannot comment, of course I have certain information, and I am also in contact with Beni, of course. I can't say anything because officially we don't know anything at all. United haven't contacted anyone from our camp. Of course, I am concerned about the player; the only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing.",
      "\"We are prepared to do everything for that, and we have never sent anyone onto the field if there was the slightest risk. However, the national team is something very special, and I expect maximum respect from everyone. Slovenia deserves that, even if on the other side there is a powerhouse like England, and something as extraordinary as the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim chose to start with a frontline of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad, and has previously utilised Mason Mount up front. Mbeumo, United's top scorer, will soon head to the Africa Cup of Nations and the Portuguese coach could soon find himself short.",

      "Ollie Watkins has not had a season that would often spark transfer rumours. The forward missed out on the most recent England squad, having recorded just one goal in 11 Premier League appearances.",
      "United have been linked before and VIlla have seemed to be open to offloading their striker before. Price has proved problematic in the past but perhaps Watkins' form could give the Red Devils an advantage.",

      "However, the latter did not count as a direct goal contribution as an attempted interception diverted the ball into Yamal's path. Rashford's corner was later headed home by Lewandowski to complete a hat-trick.",
      "Despite his influential role, Rashford missed some good scoring opportunities and received his second yellow card of the season. The booking wasn't due to a bad foul, but rather Rashford because of time-wasting as he slowly exited the pitch when being replaced by Ferran Torres in the 88th minute.",
      "While it may have been a tactic to run down the clock, Rashford's slow departure could also have been due to him soaking up the applause, with the travelling fans all standing to clap his performance",
      "Despite Rashford impressing, it wasn't a flawless display by Barcelona, who conceded two goals for the sixth time this season. However, Flick's side improved significantly in the second half, leading to questions about that specific 45-minute performance.",
      "\"I always think to say something about the experts, former players and coaches, but no, I will not do it,\" the Barcelona boss said with a smile when asked in his post-match press conference if the second period was an example of how to execute his playing style.",
      "\"I'll give you too many things to speak about and it's too much noise! But, yes, for me it's like that. We will analyse this match like we analyse every match and try to make things better. This is our job. Not everything was good; we will speak about this.",
      "\"For me, the most important thing is [the players] have the confidence and belief in what we're doing and the second half is a good example of how we want to do it.\"",
      "Reflecting on the overall display, he continued: \"Yes, [I am satisfied]. I appreciate a lot what I saw today. At the moment, it's like, especially in the first half, we made some mistakes, more than in the second half, and they use it. Two mistakes for the goals.",
      "\"But what I saw, also in first half, we controlled the game. It was a really good match with the ball, and especially in the second half, we defend much better.",
      "\"I think the second half gives us confidence also for the next matches. This is what we need. When you can make pressure on the opponent it's a good way. We did it. I like what I saw, especially in the second half.\"",

      "Manchester United have been warned that Matheus Cunha may NEVER replicate his Wolverhampton Wanderers heroics at Old Trafford by Tony Cascarino. The Brazilian playmaker completed a £62m move to the club in the summer as United overhauled their attack.",
      "Cunha arrived at United off the back of the most productive season of his career, having struck 17 times last term - 15 of those coming in the Premier League. But Cunha has scored just once so far this season in 11 appearances - that solitary goal coming in a 4-2 win against Brighton.",
      "Former Chelsea star Cascarino believes that Cunha will never quite fulfil his potential at the club after his role was changed by Ruben Amorim, while he also claims that the attacker has had a negative impact on Bruno Fernandes’ performances.",
      "Cascarino said on talkSPORT: “Matheus Cunha, there’s been an exaggeration of how well he’s done at Manchester United. He hasn’t done that well, Yes, he’s done OK and if he can get back to what he was at Wolves (he’ll be a good signing).",
      "“But look at his goals for. He’s got one in the games he’s played. I’m still not sure he’ll ever reach the level he was at Wolves because he carries the ball from the halfway line to the 18-yard box and does it well and brings the team up the pitch but he was a lot more than that at Wolves.",
      "“He had a goal one in every two games at Wolves. Also, Man Utd are suffering because they’ve had to change the dynamics of Bruno Fernandes so it’s come at a little bit of price for Manchester United.”",
      "And while Cunha’s displays have been criticised, Cascarino is also less than inspired by Benjamin Sesko. United also spent huge funds to sign him from German side RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko however has scored just twice since becoming a Red Devil and now appears to be restricted to the sidelines after picking up a knee injury in the recent draw with Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "“He [Sesko] looks like he’s so out of sorts,” Cascarino added. “I think he’s got a bad injury. I think you’re going to find out he’s out for a while.",
      "“I watched him after the pass from Fernandes, he couldn’t get it out of his feet and then it looks like he gets his leg stuck.”",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is outshining Manchester United's Mason Mount this season following the Argentinian international's switch to Chelsea. Garnacho made a £40million move to the Blues in August after a fallout with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim post the Europa League final.",
      "The 21-year-old felt he deserved more game time and voiced his frustrations publicly, reportedly leading to Amorim retorting: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer.\"",
      "The winger's departure from the club was far from amicable, having been at the club since joining the academy in 2020. Now donning the Chelsea blue, Garnacho is starting to hit his stride after an initial slow start in west London.",
      "Mount, who moved in the opposite direction from Chelsea to United, hasn't quite found his feet at Old Trafford as he did at Stamford Bridge.",
      "In fairness, Mount has had his share of injury woes. Five separate injuries have seen the 26-year-old miss over 50 games for United, but when he has featured this season, he has managed just one goal and one assist in nine appearances.",
      "In contrast, Garnacho has netted two goals and provided two assists in his 10 matches for Chelsea. Both assists came in Chelsea's 3-0 triumph over Wolves on Saturday.",
      "United have a regrettable recent history of selling players who then go on to shine at other clubs. One of the most notable examples is Scott McTominay.",
      "Since his £25m switch to Napoli last season, the Scotland international has emerged as one of the Italian side's standout performers. He claimed the Serie A MVP award for the 2024/25 campaign and secured 18th place in the 2025 Ballon d'Or rankings following Napoli's triumph in securing their fourth Italian league crown.",
      "Garnacho's journey at Chelsea hasn't yet reached McTominay's heights. Nevertheless, what unfolds could serve as a harsh wake-up call for Amorim regarding Mount's value to the squad.",
      "United's No. 7 has demonstrated tactical flexibility under Amorim. He has occasionally operated as a left-sided number 10, left-winger, and even as a false nine.",
      "The capacity to switch positions without significant disruption is something the United boss prizes highly given his distinctive formations. Towards the close of 2024, Amorim openly expressed his appreciation for Mount when he said: \"I have to tell you I love that kid.",
      "\"The first thing is he is working really hard. And then you have to understand the human also. You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Mount remains young and has ample time to rediscover any form lost this season. His deal with United runs until 2028, and with Amorim already showing his affection for the midfielder, the 26-year-old appears destined for further chances.",
      "But Amorim will surely want to witness some progress in the near future.",

      "Marcus Rashford has shown Manchester United exactly what they're letting slip through their fingers – once more. The Barcelona loan star contributed a brace of assists as the Spanish giants secured a thrilling 4-2 La Liga triumph over Celta Vigo at the Balaidos Stadium on Sunday evening.",
      "Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring within the first quarter-hour, converting from the penalty spot past Ionut Radu. Sergio Carreira levelled matters moments afterwards, exploiting Hansi Flick's notorious offside trap with devastating effect.",
      "That equaliser came moments after Rashford was guilty of missing a golden chance, but he responded well as his cross was guided home by Lewandowski later in the half. Celta Vigo responded once more though as Borja Iglesias fired beyond Wojciech Szczesny.",
      "Lamine Yamal provided the Catalan side with crucial breathing room at half-time, netting deep into added time. The United ace had turned creator again, threading the ball to the Barcelona prodigy at the far post.",
      "Lewandowski sealed the victory in the second period, completing his treble with a delicate header from a Rashford corner. With Rayo Vallecano holding Real Madrid to a stalemate, Flick's team reduced their rivals' lead in the championship chase to merely three points.",
      "Following the match, Rashford commemorated the result with a triumphant Instagram post, which garnered nearly half a million likes by Tuesday morning.",
      "The England ace wrote: \"Important three points away. We keep working TEAM.\"",
      "Among the thousands of fans who liked the post were Manchester United stars David De Gea and Bruno Fernandes. Barcelona boss Flick was chuffed with his team's performance over the weekend.",
      "Speaking to ESPN, he said: \"Yes [I am satisfied].",
      "\"I appreciate a lot what I saw today. At the moment, it's like, especially in the first half, we made some mistakes, more than in the second half, and they use it. Two mistakes for the goals.",
      "\"But what I saw, also in first half, we controlled the game. It was a really good match with the ball, and especially in the second half, we defend much better.",
      "\"I think the second half gives us confidence also for the next matches. This is what we need. When you can make pressure on the opponent it's a good way. We did it. I like what I saw, especially in the second half.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Rashford pledged to up his game – and he certainly delivered. Speaking to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo earlier this month, the 28-year-old said: \"I try to give my best.",
      "\"I could have done better against Elche, and I promise to improve because I'm not entirely happy with my performance overall. We work hard to win. We're taking it one game at a time.",

      "Marcus Rashford was at the double for Barcelona as they cruised to victory at Celta Vigo on Sunday. And his brace of assists for a resurgent Robert Lewandowski extended a prolific run of form for the Manchester United loanee.",
      "Hansi Flick's side came into this weekend sitting five points below La Liga leaders Real Madrid. However, Barca closed the gap to just three points after Los Blancos were held to a 0-0 stalemate against derby rivals Rayo Vallecano earlier on Sunday.",
      "It wasn't a faultless display, however, as noted by portions of the Spanish media. But the general reaction to Rashford's crucial pair of assists was positive as Lewandowski, who decided the game with his hat-trick, benefited greatly from the Englishman's input.",
      "Mundo Deportivo was particularly complimentary of the United loanee and described him as \"one of the key players in Vigo.\" And it wasn't only his direct goal contributions that impressed, as his set piece proved potent on the west coast.",
      "\"The English striker improved his pressing performance and delivered three corners that resulted in goals,\" read one excerpt from the newspaper's report. \"Rashford worked hard to press in defence better than in recent matches, outpaced [Oscar] Mingueza and ended up being decisive with three crosses that ended in goals, two to Lewandowski, one of them from a corner, and one that Ilaix [Moriba] deflected and Lamine Yamal finished.\"",
      "The same report lauded Rashford's \"excellent passing ability\" and detailed just how pivotal his pressing proved in off-setting Celta's rhythm. El Pais, meanwhile, highlighted Rashford was \"the Barcelona player who is taking on defenders most often when he receives the ball at his feet.\"",
      "The same newspaper hailed the Englishman's \"superb\" cross into Lewandowski for the g-ahead goal at 2-1. Sergio Carreira's early equaliser kept things competitive for most of the first half, and it wasn't long before Borja Iglesias levelled once more before the interval.",
      "It wasn't all praise, though, as Sport pointed out the forward's \"unforgivable mistake\" in missing a clear one-on-one against Celta keeper Ionut Radu. That slip in itself may not have been so terrible were it not for the fact that Carreira scored his equaliser directly from the resulting Celta counter.",
      "\"He had time, space, and every option, but his finish was weak, almost a pass to the goalkeeper,\" read the recap of his missed opportunity. \"The clearest chance of the match evaporated without consequence...or at least, without the desired one.\"",
      "But another section of the same newspaper put Rashford on a pedestal for the impacts that did hit their mark. And his \"exceptional attacking performance\" was deemed all the more positive considering Lamine Yamal had a faltering first period in Vigo.",
      "\"Rashford was a constant threat from the start of the match,\" read one passage. \"He wasn't clinical with his first scoring opportunity, and in fact, Celta's first equaliser came after the England international squandered a one-on-one with Radu that could have put Barça 2-0 up.",
      "\"However, this setback didn't faze Marcus, who ended up having a magnificent game and being the originator of three of the team's four goals at Balaidos. His crosses for Lewandowski's second and third goals were impeccable, and the Polish striker made the most of them.",
      "Rashford, who could upset Liverpool's transfer plans in January, heads into the international break having contributed at least one goal or assist in seven of his last eight league starts. And England coach Thomas Tuchel will hope to have this version of the attacker back for the Three Lions' upcoming games against Serbia and Albania.",

      "Manchester United visited Tottenham last weekend and I made my first visit to their stadium. I'd been repeatedly told it was the best arena in the country and it didn't fall short of that billing.",
      "Although the security staff took their time to admit the press into the media suite, it was worth the wait, as the press facilities and food offerings are second to none in the Premier League.",
      "The press food at Stamford Bridge is excellent, but Tottenham edges their London neighbours. The 12.30pm kick-off meant a full breakfast was on offer and the selection was superb for a media suite.",
      "The press room itself was akin to a luxury hotel reception. There was ample working space, comfortable leather-padded seats and Spurs offer lockers for journalists to store bags.",
      "The walk from the media suite to the press box is sign-posted - you could easily get lost on the way - and the interior of the ground is even more impressive than the exterior.",
      "Tottenham left White Hart Lane in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, and moved to their new 61,000-seater venue three years later. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new 100,000-seater Old Trafford by 2030 and there are a few lessons to be learned from Tottenham.",
      "The design of the stadium is outstanding. You feel like you're working in a special arena throughout your visit, and architecture firm Populous deserved all the plaudits they received.",
      "From a journalist's perspective, the press box is spacious and well-positioned, offering a good vantage point, while the media auditorium is a superb space for managers to conduct their post-match duties.",
      "Ratcliffe wants the new Old Trafford, set to be designed by Foster + Partners, to be the greatest arena in the world, and they will deliver if the rebuild is anything like Tottenham's home.",
      "Tottenham's stadium was rebuilt 170 yards away from where White Hart Lane stood, which means the feeling of the old ground hasn't been totally lost, and the new Old Trafford will seek to retain that 'feeling'.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is designed to maximise supporter experience and it brings fans closer to the pitch than at any comparable-sized stadium in the United Kingdom.",
      "The distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres to 7.9 metres, and the single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK with a capacity of 17,500 people.",
      "The steep South Stand is remarkable. It was designed with the hope that it would generate an intimidating atmosphere, but no such noise was produced during the game on Saturday.",
      "Like a lot of big clubs in the Premier League, Spurs have become a tourist attraction, which means there were hundreds of fans with tickets in that stand who did not contribute to the atmosphere.",
      "That is their prerogative and 'tourist fans' are still valued fans, but local Tottenham season ticket holders have argued their South Stand should be a designated area for supporters looking to create noise.",
      "The Stretford End is currently that stand within Old Trafford, and United should consider introducing a designated singing section to ensure an atmosphere can be created in the new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "I was fortunate enough to visit White Hart Lane before it was demolished. It was an ageing ground and Spurs were right to move on, but it could be intimidating for the opposition.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur stadium is not intimidating. It feels welcoming. United need to ensure they don't fall into the same trap.",

      "Even the most optimistic Manchester United fan would have struggled to make a decent case for extending Casemiro's contract beyond 2026 last season.",
      "The five-time Champions League winner reserved his best performances for the Europa League in 2024/25, with his Premier League showings not good enough for a team of United's stature.",
      "With no European football on offer this season it seemed the Brazilian would be on the fringes of first-team action, but three months into the campaign and he's one of the first names on the team sheet.",
      "Casemiro's contract expires next summer, though United could trigger the clause in his deal to add an additional 12 months onto his Old Trafford stay. With United expected to target a central midfielder next summer and Casemiro turning 34 in February, it might seem silly to do so. But he's still showing he can add value to the squad and could prove to be an invaluable mentor for any new recruit.",
      "So what should United do? Our writers have had their say:",
      "Casemiro has been hugely important this season. United are weaker when he is not on the pitch, which was highlighted again last weekend when he was replaced by Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Wilson Odobert breezed past Ugarte and Tottenham scored an equaliser. Casemiro's strong performances have sparked a conversation about his contract situation, but I believe he should be allowed to leave in the summer on a free transfer, regardless of how important he continues to be this season.",
      "United must take a long-term view and it's not logical to extend Casemiro's contract when he's in the winter of his career, so this season should be his swansong in Manchester.",
      "The fact that there is even a conversation among some fans about extending Casemiro's deal is a credit to him, but United should allow him to leave in the summer and sign a replacement.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 in February. How long he can keep up this level of performance is up for debate, and that's without mentioning he is the highest earner in the dressing room.",
      "The end of the season is an opportunity to move on from Casemiro and it should be taken. The Brazilian can leave the club with his head held high if he bows out by helping to secure Champions League qualification.",
      "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher seldom pull punches but even by their hard-hitting standards, a couple of remarks about Casemiro were genuine haymakers.",
      "“I think he (Erik ten Hag) oversaw two of the worst transfers Manchester United will ever have made in the signings of Casemiro and Antony,” Neville once said.",
      "Well, Casemiro has not only survived the verbal blows, he has produced a few performances that suggest reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated. Everyone knows this season’s most telling Casemiro statistic - five goals conceded when he has been on the pitch, 15 when he has been off it.",
      "He also has three goals, one assist and tops the tackle chart with 22. In short, he is proving a very valuable asset for Ruben Amorim.",
      "United should keep him for another season. If that means activating a clause which keeps him on the same extravagant wages, then fine.",
      "It’s a big club. Act big. Amorim will be desperate for a younger, more athletic, more dynamic defensive midfielder, but he will also need experienced alternatives and back-up. If that costs a few more quid than you would like, so be it.",
      "Football has not left Casemiro… and he should not be leaving Old Trafford.",
      "United will sign a central midfielder next summer and so there isn't much of a case to be made for keeping Casemiro for his influence on the pitch. However, having somebody with his experience around the club would be a massive help for whoever United decide to sign.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has done little this season to suggest he can help a new signing bed in, and so Casemiro should be kept at Old Trafford. That being said, it would have to be on reduced terms. United cannot afford to have such a high earner on the books purely for the experience he brings, and so a compromise on his salary would need to be reached.",
      "There's no escaping the fact United look a much better side when Casemiro is in the team. Full credit goes to the Brazilian for turning the public perception of him around.",
      "Should he stay beyond this season? Yes, but only on the right terms. United cannot afford for Casemiro to be one of the highest earners at the club.",
      "He has proven this season that he can play this system and be a good option for Amorim. Should he stay, United still can't avoid the midfield issue for another summer - they must sign a new first choice defensive midfielder and allow Casemiro to be the back-up.",

      "The 33-year-old has become an important player for club and country again, starting nine games in the Premier League and forcing his way back into Brazil's starting team under Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "However, Casemiro is the highest earner in the United dressing room and there is an ongoing conversation among supporters about whether he merits a contract extension.",
      "The Brazilian has reported for international duty and sat down for an interview with O Globo, in which he was asked about his plans for the future after June.",
      "Casemiro responded: \"Football is my life, right? So it's inevitable [to continue]. But I think my wife and family will want some time for themselves, yes. I'm one of those who think that in life you have to have a plan.",
      "\"But I'm into short-term goals. Of course, it's inevitable to think about being in good shape for a World Cup, but you can't expect to be in good shape for the World Cup if you're not doing well at Manchester United.",
      "\"For the next call-up, I have to be in good shape. I think day by day: tomorrow I have a good training session, at the weekend I have to play a great game, and so on.\"",
      "Speaking ahead of Tottenham, Amorim was asked about Casemiro's contract situation and he said: \"Yeah, we don't know what is going to happen. My goal is to continue to count with Casemiro, with Harry Maguire, that he has the same problem. I don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"Let's focus on this season. I'm really happy with Casemiro, he is really important. I'm really happy with Harry, but I know what you guys are asking, let's focus on this season and then we'll see the next season.\"",
      "Casemiro also discussed Brazil's national team ahead of the World Cup, saying: \"I think we will arrive very strong. I think we are still a little behind in terms of time [of work].",
      "\"Especially if you look at the number of days the coach [Ancelotti] has been working. It's not the same as other national teams, which have different cycles, right? If you analyse it in days, we're talking about 30 to 40 days with him.",
      "\"But I think we've arrived at a good moment because we have quality players, we have high-level players, and I think that, along with the coach and his experience in football, is also a very important factor. He's a guy who manages to unite the group, not just the players, but everyone on the staff.\"",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko will not report for international duty after picking up a knee injury.",
      "Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour and was forced off the pitch after receiving treatment for a knee injury.",
      "United had to finish the game with 10 men because Amorim had used all of his substitutions.",
      "Sesko will continue to be assessed at Carrington this week, but sources have indicated the injury is not thought to be a major issue.",
      "Sesko was spotted limping as he left the stadium. Amorim was asked about the injury during his press conference and said: \"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see.\"",
      "When asked whether it was serious, Amorim said: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons in the summer. The 22-year-old started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "Sesko built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month. However, he was benched against Liverpool at Anfield and failed to score in the next three matches.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer live blog on Tuesday, November 11.",
      "Having not lost since late September, United head into the latest international break on a high especially after their late fightback against Tottenham. One negative from the 2-2 draw was the early departure of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He has since dominated headlines with both positive and concerning injury updates emerging on his condition.",
      "Another United striker in Rasmus Hojlund has endured a difficult last few weeks with a return to Old Trafford hinted at. Elsewhere, United continue to be linked to several midfielders ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "The likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are all serious options Prior to interest in all three, a move for Amadou Onana was formally made before he ultimately joined Aston Villa.",
      "With all of that being said, follow along below for all the latest United transfer news, rumours and updates.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho delivered his best performance in a Chelsea shirt during their 3-0 win over Wolves.",
      "The Argentine assisted Malo Gusto and Pedro Neto as he gave both Santiago Bueno and Jackson Tchatchoua a torrid time on the left.",
      "While things did not work out at Old Trafford, United were firmly aware of his ability as the club inserted a 10% sell-on clause in Garnacho’s move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "This at least protects United in the future to some degree if he does depart the Blues for big money which is entirely possible given how frequently Chelsea sell on their assets.",
      "Senne Lammens could make his debut for Belgium's senior team over the November international break.",
      "Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois is the undisputed No.1 but he has suffered an injury which will see him remain in Spain for the November international break.",
      "Lammens now looks set to be competing with Matz Sels for the gloves and if it is based on merit, Lammens should be given the nod with the Nottingham Forest goalkeeper having made a number of mistakes so far this season.",
      "Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is one of many high-profile midfielders of interest to Manchester United.",
      "The former Newcastle United man scored his first goal of the season in the 3-1 win over Leeds United this past weekend alongside another dominant display in the engine room. Anderson has been exceptionally consistent this season which has allowed him to break into the England team.",
      "That update suggests that some form of talks have been held whether that be internally, with Forest or to Anderson's camp.",
      "During this difficult spell for Napoli, Antonio Conte has made his feelings on Rasmus Hojlund clear.",
      "Following the 2-0 defeat to Bologna, which was the fourth consecutive game without a goal for Hojlund, Conte was asked directly about the Manchester United loannee's display.",
      "He said to DAZN, via Tutto Mercato Web: \"I didn't mind today, he was perhaps the best player on the pitch. He held his ground and fought. It's inevitable that we had some things prepared, we should have supported him more. We missed him.\"",
      "The future of Rasmus Hojlund has been another trending topic over the last few days and that is for two reasons.",
      "The first of those arrived in the immediate aftermath of the draw with Tottenham as questions began to be asked on whether or not he could be recalled from a loan spell at Napoli following Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "However, the only clause included in his temporary switch was a buy-option with the Denmark international set to remain in Naples for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "This past Sunday, Napoli were beaten by Bologna. It was also the third consecutive game they have not scored.",
      "Head coach Antonio Conte went on quite the rant afterwards with it later noted crisis talks were set to be held over his future at the club.",
      "This arrived after Conte appeared to publicly criticise Napoli's summer transfer business. \"Last year, we won an extraordinary and incredible championship, where everyone pushed their limits with great unity and unity across the board.",
      "\"This year, however, between playing so many games and bringing in so many players.",
      "\"In my opinion, nine new players were too many. We weren't balanced. I've always said this year would be difficult; there are some aspects that need to be absorbed over time.\"",
      "Speaking to Sport Witness, Amadou Onana's agent, Melissa Onana, confirmed that Manchester United made a transfer approach for the midfielder when he was at Everton, but just before he joined Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa’s sporting project was crystal clear. It was a project where Amadou could continue to develop. We spoke with the sporting director, and the salary was also attractive, let’s not kid ourselves.",
      "The Euros were coming up, Amadou was performing well, and we finalised the deal. Then, Manchester United entered the picture. But I had already given my word to Aston Villa.",
      "We knew very well that Manchester would be able to offer better financial terms, but we had already given our word to Aston Villa, and the project was a good fit. The style of football played, the club’s ambition: Amadou felt right at home there.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's knee injury has been the main discussion point for Manchester United over the last 72 hours or so.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced off this past weekend with a knee issue and was later filmed hobbling as he left the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Sesko is set to remain at Carrington over the international break to continuing being assessed.",
      "That news did not seemingly reach Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek before his Monday press conference as he stated that the national team had not \"officially received anything yet, no paper, no document\".",
      "He later added: \"The national team is something very special and I expect maximum respect from everyone. Slovenia deserves that, even if there's a superpower like England on the other side, and something as exceptional as the Premier League.\"",
      "Slovenia are set to face Kosovo and Sweden in two potentially important World Cup qualifiers but it looks as though they will have to navigate them without Sesko.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund does not have a recall clause in his Napoli loan contract, according to Fabrizio Romano, as Manchester United consider January striker cover after Benjamin Sesko suffered a knee injury on Saturday.",
      "There has been talk that Hojlund could return to Old Trafford in the winter transfer window following Sesko's injury setback during the 2-2 draw against Tottenham. However, United won't be able to recall the Denmark international, who joined Napoli on a season-long loan in the summer.",
      "Matjaz Kek has claimed that Manchester United have failed to provide an update to the Slovenian national team on Benjamin Sesko's knee injury.",
      "Speaking at a rally in Gorenjska, the Slovenia manager said: \"With all due respect to a big club like Manchester United.",
      "\"We haven't officially received anything yet, no paper, no document. We would definitely like to receive it, we also want the player to be examined by our medical service.",
      "\"Our doctor is an expert in this field, we don't have anyone in this position. I can't comment, of course I have certain information, I'm also in contact with Beni.",
      "\"But I can't say anything because officially we know absolutely nothing, United hasn't contacted anyone from our camp. Of course I'm worried about the player, the only thing I'm interested in is his well-being, we're ready to do everything for that and we've never sent anyone onto the field if there was the slightest risk.",

      "Three wins on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton were tenure-defining, but United have shipped more goals than Amorim would like, which meant November started with two draws. The quirk is that Amorim has the most strength in depth in the defensive department, but it's currently the area that is letting the team down.",

      "\"Just play football. He's a good player. But at the moment, it's difficult at Man United. They found a little form in the past couple of weeks and I hope for Man United that they continue that. Because a good Man United is good for the Premier League as well.\"",

      "The Brazil international was superb last season but has thus far failed to reach the same standards with former head coach Vitor Pereira strangely opting to drop both him and Andre.",
      "Links to Gomes have arrived in recent days and with Wolves appearing destined for the drop, it seems unlikely he will stay which presents United with an opportunity they could look to even take advantage of in January.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim refused to be drawn into questions surrounding the form of Benjamin Sesko following the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.",
      "The striker was introduced around the hour-mark, but failed to make an impact and ultimately left the pitch with an injury. The extent of that is current unclear but it does not look good.",
      "With that being said, MEN Sport has taken a look three options that replace the forward.",
      "Click here to read more",
      "Manchester United have been predicted to qualify for Europe through their Premier League finish, according to OPTA analytics.",
      "Unbeaten in five league games, Ruben Amorim looks to have turned a corner after a challenging first 12 months in the job.",
      "Despite that, United's expected final position has been revealed as seventh with a total of 56 points - only marginally ahead of Bournemouth. They are also three and four points behind Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, respectively.",
      "Following Benjamin Sesko's knee injury, questions started to emerge over Rasmus Hojlund and whether or not he could be recalled from a loan spell at Napoli.",
      "However, under the terms of his switch, United do not have the option to bring him back with the £38million buy-option clause the only term inserted into his move.",
      "The Denmark international made a great start to his Napoli career but he has now gone four games without a goal and Antonio Conte's side have struggled to find the back of the net as such.",
      "Goalless draws against Como and Eintracht Frankfurt came before Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Bologna with Hojlund playing the full 90 minutes. He was unsurprisingly booked after committing five fouls and losing 13 duels.",
      "Benjamin Sesko picked up a knee injury during Manchester United's draw with Tottenham and several updates have emerged since then.",
      "The first of those came from Ruben Amorim as he admitted the striker had a \"problem\". An update from Slovenia ahead of their international fixtures then arrived with it stated he underwent an initial examination on his knee on Sunday.",

      "Sheffield Wednesday manager Henrik Pedersen has described Harry Amass' progress on loan as \"amazing\".",
      "Manchester United loaned Amass to Wednesday in the summer. The Owls have been in turmoil due to their ownership situation, but Amass has been given regular minutes in S6.",
      "The youngster has made 11 starts in the Championship and scored his first professional goal against Southampton last weekend, finding the right corner from the edge of the box.",
      "United are delighted with Amass' loan at Hillsborough so far and Wednesday's manager lauded the 18-year-old when he spoke about his progress after his first goal for the club.",
      "Speaking to the Sheffield Star, Pedersen said of Amass: \"The young man who came into Sheffield Wednesday and the young man who just left the stadium today are two different humans.",
      "\"And they are two different players. His progression has been amazing and, for a young player like Harry, he came with a lot of energy, but then the Championship always come knocking with three games in a row.",
      "\"It is tough, but he keeps on playing. This week, against West Brom, against Norwich, against Southampton, he showed against three good teams that he can compete with them.",
      "\"It's not only that he can compete but he can be dominant in some phases. So I think he has done a big development as a player and what I see is a young man who has started to have a big knowledge about himself as a human - who he wants to be, who he doesn't want to be.",
      "\"He has started to control when his mood comes down to be more stable. I see a young guy who has started to be physically stronger. He runs more, he has started to sprint more, he has more accelerations and he starts to have smaller breaks in the game. He has started to be better between the phases of the game.",
      "\"I like him. He is a good boy, he is a good player and he loves to learn. We love to have him here.\"",
      "This means Wednesday must request to extend the loan if they wish to keep him for the season. If they do so, United will then choose whether to accept or reject the request.",
      "The agreement was structured as an alternative to inserting a break clause into the deal, something United often do. The structure of the deal suited Wednesday given their financial uncertainty.",
      "However, United are covering the costs of Amass' loan to facilitate game time, which raises the possibility of another Championship club making an offer to sign Amass and offering to cover the costs themselves.",
      "That does not necessarily mean that an offer to cover the costs of Amass' loan would be favoured, due to sources stressing that game time is the priority when making such a decision.",
      "Amass spoke to the Sheffield Star about the second half of the campaign, saying: “At the moment I haven't really thought too much about it even though it is coming.",
      "\"I just want to play in the games and a lot of stuff has happened higher. We're waiting for things to get straightened out and we'll sort it out closer to the time. But at the moment I'm just enjoying playing here.”",
      "Amass continued: “I spoke to the gaffer a few times and I trusted him right from the start, he showed a lot of passion and care for me and that's one of the big reasons I came. It's a big club and I just wanted to come and play some football and really be a part of something. I wanted a challenge.",
      "“There's a few people that I speak to such as old coaches, loan managers, Jonny being the main one. I speak to him a lot. I speak with these guys frequently and a lot of staff members that I've spent time with over the years. I'm keeping in close touch with everyone.”",

      "The nights are becoming longer, the weather cooler and people across the country are starting to look forward to Christmas - unless you are a Manchester United fan of course.",
      "Once Santa is dropping off his presents, United will be without one of their main gifts this season. That is when Amad will be bidding goodbye to the UK as he heads to Africa for AFCON.",
      "His role at right wing-back has been heavily discussed but the consensus is that while improvements need to be made defensively, he more than earns his place thanks to his offensive capabilities. His connection with Bryan Mbeumo, another star set to leave for AFCON this winter, has been a joy to behold and something which United fans will miss from Christmas Eve onwards.",
      "Unlike a lengthy and unexpected injury crisis in the Christmas period, Ruben Amorim at least benefits from the foresight that two of his star players are set to be missing for one of the busiest times of the season. When it comes to Mbeumo, the plan to replace him is obvious.",
      "Mason Mount has done well this season and can easily slip into the No.10 role with little fuss. The conversation around Amad's replacement is trickier though.",
      "On paper, you would think that Diogo Dalot would move onto the right flank allowing Patrick Dorgu to feature on the left. But, Dalot's performances have been poor for the most part this season and he lost his place in the starting XI completely for the Tottenham game.",
      "But against Spurs, Amorim did hint at the alternative solution to using Dalot - Noussair Mazraoui. The Moroccan has had to be patient this season for United.",
      "He was used on the right of the back three last season but the Leny Yoro/Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw combination seems set. As touched upon, Amad has been the favourite at right wing-back so the former Bayern Munich man has needed to wait for his chance.",
      "That opportunity came in north London and Mazraoui handled it well. He was solid, if unspectacular, and United fans cannot complain with the performance he put in.",
      "Of course, when Amad is not at wing-back, you don't get the same attacking overload on the right flank which works so well normally. But, on the flip side, United are not as shaky defensively there either.",
      "Amad's promotion into the No.10 role has given United fans a hint of the plan Amorim will use whilst the 23-year-old is away with the Ivory Coast. We can expect Matheus Cunha and Mount to feature in the No.10 roles with Mazraoui supporting Mount on his flank.",
      "That will leave Dalot to battle it out with Dorgu for the other wing-back role, a fight which cannot be called at this stage. The Dane got the nod against Spurs but his teammate will be pushing him all the way for a start.",
      "Amorim is right to start introducing Mazraoui into this team now. By Christmas and the New Year, he will be expected to feature in five matches in just two and a half weeks as United's squad is stretched to the maximum.",
      "He simply could not go into that sort of run with extremely limited game time. It would have been a recipe for disaster.",
      "United supporters can therefore expect to see more of Mazraoui between now and the beginning of AFCON as Amorim's plan begins to take further shape.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told that there is still a significant amount of work to be done if Manchester United are to break into the Premier League's top four.",
      "United managed to salvage a draw at Tottenham on Saturday, thanks to a 95th-minute header from Matthijs de Ligt. Spurs seemed to have the game in the bag with Thomas Frank's team leading 2-1 in the dying moments of the match, following goals from Mathys Tel and Richarlison which cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's opener.",
      "However, De Ligt found an opening at the back post following a late corner kick, securing a point for the visitors. United head coach Amorim has received plaudits recently due to the club's improved form, which has seen them go unbeaten in five Pre‎mier League matches, lifting them to seventh place in the league standings.",
      "However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster believes there is still scope for improvement if they want to secure a top-four finish, particularly when compared to local rivals Manchester City.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, the former Wrexham keeper said: \"They look like they're playing with a lot more confidence than they have done for most of this season. But I just think when you contrast it with the quality of Man City, for example, it's very evident there's still quite a way to go.\"",
      "When presenter Jeff Stelling questioned him about United's chances of breaking into the top four, Foster said: \"I just think it's too competitive, I really do. There's probably a dozen teams in the Premier L‎eague who can realistically beat anybody on a Saturday.",
      "\"Even if you go down to the likes of Brighton, Bournemouth and Sunderland, you just don't know what you're going to get. They [United] should be aiming for the top four but whether that's a realistic target or not, it is just so hard to call.\"",
      "However, despite his measured outlook, Foster believes United have raised their game under Amorim after a disappointing opening to the campaign. He also indicated that the United squad are now embracing the former Sporting Lisbon boss's philosophy.",
      "Foster said: \"We're seeing it all over the Prem‎ier League that putting a string of games together where you're winning consistently is really hard to do.",
      "\"Sometimes you just have to make sure you don't lose. For Manchester United, they would have lost that game earlier in the season. They wouldn't have had it about them to go and really search for that equaliser. I think it's a mentality shift in the players.",
      "\"They've all started to buy into it now from what the manager is saying. You can see when players play with that belief, that positivity and that confidence that you get better results for it as well.\"",
      "Amorim suffered a setback against Spurs when summer arrival Benjamin Sesko sustained an injury after 85 minutes. The Slovenian striker had only come on shortly before the hour mark, with the United manager revealing the extent of the problem following the final whistle.",
      "\"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see,\" the Portuguese said. \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",

      "Manchester United have a level of protection in case Alejandro Garnacho is sold by Chelsea for a fee of £40million.",
      "Garnacho got off to a slow start to his new campaign with the Blues. He spent two of the opening five games in all competitions this season on the bench and only started in Chelsea's EFL Cup clash with Lincoln.",
      "However, in recent weeks, the 21-year-old has begun to find his feet. Garnacho has picked up two goals and two assists in his last four games under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Although this will surely put a smile on the Chelsea manager's face, United fans may be concerned that their club has once again sold a player who could go on to excel elsewhere. But it seems United were wise to the situation, especially considering Chelsea's current transfer model.",
      "Chelsea are known for acquiring young players with high potential on long-term contracts - Garnacho’s deal runs until 2032. The aim is to build a youthful squad and, when the time is right, sell players for a profit after developing their careers.",
      "United were clearly aware of Chelsea’s approach, as the club inserted a 10% sell-on clause in Garnacho’s deal. This means that if Chelsea were to sell him for double his current value, around £80m, Ruben Amorim’s side would receive £8m from the transfer.",
      "The Argentinian international left Old Trafford following a public disagreement with Amorim. Garnacho was unhappy with his limited playtime in the Europa League final.",
      "He said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Now seeking a fresh start at Chelsea, Garnacho will be hoping to prove Amorim wrong. United, on the other hand, will likely be content if their 10% sell-on clause eventually pays off.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Antonio Conte has spoken highly of Rasmus Hojlund despite the fact he has now failed to score in four straight Napoli matches. The 22-year-old joined the Italian champions on a season-long loan this past summer and was able to make an immediate impact.",
      "Hojlund netted on his debut against Fiorentina before grabbing a brace in the Champions League against Sporting CP with both of those strikes assisted by Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "He also scored against Genoa just four days later, but that was his last goal for Napoli with Hojlund failing to find the back of the net between October and November international breaks.",
      "Playing for Denmark last month, the Manchester United loannee did contribute to four goals which certainly shows he is not lacking confidence. With De Bruyne out injured, creating chances for him appears to be the issue at Napoli as he has managed just four shots in as many games.",
      "That seems to also be the stance of Conte as the Napoli boss praised Hojlund's effort levels \"I didn't mind today, he was perhaps the best player on the pitch,\" he told DAZN, via Tutto Mercato Web, of his display at Bologna.",
      "\"He held his ground and fought. It's inevitable that we had some things prepared, we should have supported him more. We missed him.\" Considering what he said about the team as a whole, that was quite a positive verdict on Hojlund's behaviour with Napoli believed to have later held crisis talks over Conte's future at the club.",
      "\"Something needs to be done, because I don't want to accompany a dead person, I am the first eventually and take responsibility,\" the Italian admitted after Napoli's defeat.",
      "\"At the first negative situation we broke up, I will also talk to the club about this aspect.",
      "\"I don't see alchemy but everyone thinking about their own problem. Heart transplants aren't possible. Each of us must rediscover the spirit, the heart, the wickedness. Things are done but we have to see how they are done.",
      "'It's one thing to do your homework, it's another to play in a team with very high expectations. Everyone is thinking about their own backyard, I had already seen this and so I want to speak well with the club.\"",
      "Hojlund potentially returning to United became a topic discussed by many after Benjamin Sesko's injury, but under the clause of his temporary switch, that cannot happen. Ruben Amorim will therefore be hoping the knee issue suffered by his summer signing is not serious.",

      "Lionel Scaloni did not name Martinez in Argentina's squad for the upcoming internationals, but the 27-year-old will link up with his national side during a training camp in Europe to build fitness.",

      "Before United's trip to Nottingham Forest, Amorim explained: \"He wants to go to this one [Forest], he isn't going to this one. He's going to need time. He has started training with us, but we had to change some things in his exercises, so slowly he is going to get better.",
      "\"It's really good. He gives use that edge in every training session, that is also really good for us. The rest of the guys we have one day. I don't know about Harry Maguire, the rest are fit.\"",

      "Manchester United had the opportunity to climb to fourth by winning against Tottenham last weekend, but they head into the internationals sitting in seventh position with 18 points.",
      "Ruben Amorim said the Nottingham Forest draw was two points dropped and the outcome was the same against Spurs last weekend. United would be on the same points as Manchester City if they had won those matches after taking leads. Amorim will be delighted nonetheless with the team's turnaround.",
      "United have made progress and demonstrated the fight they lacked last season by scoring late goals to avoid defeat in their last two games. \"If you can't win, don't lose,\" has been the mantra.",
      "Amorim explained after Tottenham: \"We have a lot of problems, we are just in the beginning, sometimes the results show to people we are improving, but we have a lot to do.\"",
      "The 40-year-old was named the Premier League's manager of the month for October. Three wins on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton were tenure-defining, but United have shipped more goals than Amorim would like, which meant November started with two draws.",
      "The quirk is that Amorim has the most strength in depth in the defensive department, but it's currently the area that is letting the team down. The Reds must tighten up when football resumes after the break.",
      "Tottenham created just 0.05 xG against Chelsea, their lowest on record since Opta started collecting Premier League xG data in 2012/13, but they scored twice against United.",
      "United have conceded 18 goals in the league this season. The teams that are above in the table have something in common: they have made it harder for the opposition to score.",
      "Arsenal have conceded an impressive five goals and City have conceded eight. Chelsea have conceded 11, while Sunderland, Tottenham and Aston Villa have all conceded 10.",
      "Chelsea, Spurs and Aston Villa are competitors for the Champions League places and have stronger defensive records than United. \"It's a problem, especially if you see the league nowadays. The team winning lots of games is not suffering goals, or shots on target,\" said Amorim last week.",
      "\"In one opportunity, you can score a goal and win the game. But I think it's more of a team thing, we need to defend better. We need to be more aggressive. And we defend better when we have more energy. We have a lot to do and cannot suffer the amount of goals we are suffering.\"",
      "The defensive record would be worse without Senne Lammens, who has surprised Amorim with the extent of his impact since his confident debut against Sunderland last month.",
      "Lammens has been excellent, making several important saves. The Belgian international has still conceded seven goals in five games, two more than Arsenal have conceded in the entire league campaign.",
      "Every fan who has watched Lammens will tell you that is certainly not his fault. The blame lies with the team as a collective and Amorim must come up with a quick solution to address it.",
      "At the beginning of the season, club sources outlined that Europe was the target for the campaign, but securing qualification for the Champions League again must be the specific goal.",
      "United must concede fewer goals to achieve that aim and the players must take responsibility, as some individual errors have led to goals. Patrick Dorgu made the foul leading to Danny Welbeck's free-kick goal for Brighton and Joshua Zirkzee lost his marker at a corner for their second.",
      "Diogo Dalot was passive in the build-up to Morgan Gibbs-White's goal for Nottingham Forest and there was a breakdown in communication between Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Casemiro for their second.",
      "Manuel Ugarte allowed Tottenham forward Wilson Odobert to breeze past him last weekend. Ugarte was far too weak and De Ligt was turned by Mathys Tel, who scored the equaliser.",
      "The Premier League is so competitive that fine margins often decide the outcome of games. United must remain concentrated throughout the full 90 minutes - not just for most of the game.",
      "It would be worrying if Amorim had downplayed the number of goals conceded this season, but the United boss is aware of the problem and will be working on the training ground to fix it.",

      "Alongside his corner being headed home by the Poland international to complete a hat-trick, Rashford created two big chances on the left. Lewandowski guided home his first cross into the box with Lamine Yamal benefiting from another of Rashford's passes.",
      "The latter did not count as a direct goal contribution with an attempted interception taking the ball into Yamal's path. Despite his influential role, Rashford missed some good chances to score and he also picked up a second yellow card of the season.",

      "United were at their fluid best in the first half. When Spurs were in possession, United dropped into a back four with Luke Shaw pushing into a central midfield position.",
      "But he was not the only one to move positions. Harry Maguire found himself on the wing trying to cross into the box and at one stage Patrick Dorgu was almost in a centre-forward role as Bryan Mbeumo covered at wing-back.",

      "Amorim was asked about the striker's injury at his post-match press conference following the 2-2 draw. \"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether it was serious, Amorim said: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "Sesko failed to pull the trigger twice when he was presented with two half chances against Spurs, but Amorim believes a lack of confidence wasn't to blame. He said: \"No, I think... I think that is not the biggest concern now.",
      "\"That happened in the same way that he is not scoring and then he scores two goals in the next two games [Brentford and Sunderland], so that happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations in December, which prompted Amorim to confirm the club could be active in the January window.",
      "Amorim said the severity of Sesko's knee injury could influence plans. \"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has reminded Manchester United what they're missing out on – again. The Barcelona loanee chipped in with a couple of assists as the Spanish champions enjoyed a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo at the Balaidos Stadium on Sunday night.",
      "Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock inside the opening quarter of an hour, beating Ionut Radu from 12 yards. Sergio Carreira equalised a few moments later, slicing through the heart of Hansi Flick's infamous offside trap.",
      "The veteran striker restored Barcelona's lead later in the first half, latching onto a delightfully weighted cross from Rashford. Celta Vigo pulled one back, again, with Borja Iglesias smashing the ball past Wojciech Szczesny.",
      "Lamine Yamal gave the Catalan outfit some breathing space at the break, finding the net deep into stoppage time. The United star had turned provider again, picking out the Barcelona wonderkid at the back post.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "Lewandowski put the fourth and final nail in the coffin in the second half to complete his hat-trick. With Rayo Vallecano holding Real Madrid to a goalless draw, Flick's side narrowed their rivals' advantage in the title race to just three points.",
      "After the game, Rashford marked the occasion with a celebratory post on Instagram, which chalked up almost half a million likes by Tuesday morning. The England international wrote: \"Important three points away. We keep working TEAM.\"",
      "Among the thousands of fans who liked the post were David De Gea and Bruno Fernandes. Flick was pleased to see an improvement in his side's general play over the weekend. As quoted by ESPN, the Barcelona boss told reporters: \"Yes [I am satisfied].",
      "\"I appreciate a lot what I saw today. At the moment, it's like, especially in the first half, we made some mistakes, more than in the second half, and they use it. Two mistakes for the goals.",
      "\"But what I saw, also in first half, we controlled the game. It was a really good match with the ball, and especially in the second half, we defend much better.",
      "\"I think the second half gives us confidence also for the next matches. This is what we need. When you can make pressure on the opponent it's a good way. We did it. I like what I saw, especially in the second half.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Rashford vowed to improve his overall performance – and he delivered. Speaking to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo earlier this month, the 28-year-old said: \"I try to give my best.",
      "\"I could have done better against Elche, and I promise to improve because I'm not entirely happy with my performance overall. We work hard to win. We're taking it one game at a time.",
      "\"We need to keep playing as a team. This is Barca, and the demands must always be at their highest.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford delivered two assists for Barcelona as they secured a comfortable win at Celta Vigo on Sunday. His creative contributions for a rejuvenated Robert Lewandowski continued an impressive spell of form for the Manchester United loanee.",
      "Hansi Flick's team began the weekend trailing La Liga leaders Real Madrid by five points. Yet Barca narrowed the deficit to just three points after Los Blancos were held to a goalless draw against derby opponents Rayo Vallecano earlier on Sunday.",
      "The performance wasn't without its flaws, though, as highlighted by sections of the Spanish press. Nevertheless, the overall response to Rashford's vital pair of assists was favourable as Lewandowski, who secured the three points thanks to his hat-trick, profited significantly from the Englishman's contribution.",
      "Mundo Deportivo was especially emphatic in its praise of the United loanee and labelled him as \"one of the key players in Vigo.\" Beyond his direct goal involvements, his set-piece delivery proved dangerous on the west coast.",
      "\"The English striker improved his pressing performance and delivered three corners that resulted in goals,\" read one passage from the newspaper's coverage. \"Rashford worked hard to press in defence better than in recent matches, outpaced [Oscar] Mingueza and ended up being decisive with three crosses that ended in goals, two to Lewandowski, one of them from a corner, and one that Ilaix [Moriba] deflected and Lamine Yamal finished.\"",
      "The same analysis praised Rashford's \"excellent passing ability\" and explained how crucial his pressing was in disrupting Celta's flow. Meanwhile, El Pais emphasised that Rashford was \"the Barcelona player who is taking on defenders most often when he receives the ball at his feet.\"",
      "The publication also described the Englishman's \"superb\" delivery to Lewandowski for the decisive goal at 2-1. Sergio Carreira's early equaliser kept the contest level for much of the opening period, with Borja Iglesias again restoring parity before half-time.",
      "However, it wasn't entirely positive, as Sport highlighted the attacker's \"unforgivable mistake\" when he squandered a clear one-on-one opportunity against Celta goalkeeper Ionut Radu. That error proved particularly costly at the time as Carreira netted his equaliser immediately from the subsequent Celta breakaway.",
      "\"He [Rashford] had time, space, and every option, but his finish was weak, almost a pass to the goalkeeper,\" read one excerpt. \"The clearest chance of the match evaporated without consequence...or at least, without the desired one.\"",
      "Yet another section of the same publication celebrated Rashford for the contributions that did prove effective. His \"exceptional attacking performance\" was considered especially impressive given Lamine Yamal endured a difficult opening half in Vigo.",
      "Sport's evaluation put the Englishman on a pedestal: \"Rashford was a constant threat from the start of the match. He wasn't clinical with his first scoring opportunity, and in fact, Celta's first equaliser came after the England international squandered a one-on-one with Radu that could have put Barcca 2-0 up.",
      "\"However, this setback didn't faze Marcus, who ended up having a magnificent game and being the originator of three of the team's four goals at Balaidos. His crosses for Lewandowski's second and third goals were impeccable, and the Polish striker made the most of them.\"",
      "Rashford, whose long-term future in Catalonia is still far from certain, enters the international break having registered at least one goal or assist in seven of his previous eight league appearances. England manager Thomas Tuchel will be hoping to see this form continue when the Three Lions face Serbia and Albania in their forthcoming fixtures.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay has urged Napoli to sign Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with the Scotland international speaking to Antonio Conte about his former teammate.",
      "Mainoo has fallen drastically down the pecking order at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim. After being a regular last term, the 20-year-old has played just eight games so far this term.",
      "Amorim has preferred Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Premier League games, with Mainoo coming off the bench in seven of the first 10 games. However, he was an unused sub in the 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest and was left out of the squad entirely against Tottenham, due to a knock.",
      "With United already out of the Carabao Cup and not playing European football, Mainoo's minutes are expected to be limited until the January transfer window, which could place his World Cup hopes in doubt.",
      "A temporary move has been tipped ahead of the reopening of the window, with Napoli strongly linked. Previously, it had been reported that the Italian champions would be willing to pay his full salary to bring him to Naples.",
      "Now, The Sun have reported that McTominay is doing all he can to reunite with Mainoo in Serie A. The 28-year-old left United in 2024 and scored 12 goals in his first season, winning the Scudetto.",
      "Sources have told the outlet that McTominay has informed Conte that he should sanction a move to sign Mainoo. \"Scott has been to see Conte and told him to get Kobbie,\" the source said.",
      "\"He's told him all about his strengths and what an outstanding player he is. He knows all about him from his time at United and thinks he would be a great addition to the squad, whether it's on loan or a permanent deal.",
      "\"Kobbie has been brought up the right way at United having been in the academy since he was a little boy. He would fit straight in and give Napoli a boost.\"",
      "In a recent interview, Amorim admitted there simply isn't room for Mainoo in his squad. \"Every minute we are using to prepare the future with a lot of games and less training,\" Amorim told beIN Sports.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "The sister of a star Premier League midfielder has revealed why he turned down the chance to join Manchester United and instead headed to a league rival.",
      "United’s midfield is perhaps the area causing the most worry at the moment. The attack has been addressed, with summer signings Bryan Mbeumo – Premier League player of the month for October – Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all developing well.",
      "There is a wealth of defensive options, with the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro and Harry Maguire in the centre, and Patrick Dorgu, Diogo Dalot and Amad Diallo out in the wide roles.",
      "But in the midfield, Manuel Ugarte has struggled, Casemiro has been inconsistent, Bruno Fernandes is playing out of position and Kobbie Mainoo can’t get a game.",
      "United attempted to sort their midfield in 2024, with Amadou Onana courted after a solid spell with Everton.",
      "His sister has now revealed why Onana turned down United in favour of heading to Aston Villa, where he’s since played 43 times and scored six goals.",
      "Onana’s sister and agent, Melissa, said: “Aston Villa’s sporting project was crystal clear. It was a project where Amadou could continue to develop. We spoke with the sporting director, and the salary was also attractive, let’s not kid ourselves.",
      "“The Euros were coming up, Amadou was performing well, and we finalised the deal. Then, Manchester United entered the picture. But I had already given my word to Aston Villa.",
      "“We knew very well that Manchester would be able to offer better financial terms, but we had already given our word to Aston Villa, and the project was a good fit. The style of football played, the club’s ambition: Amadou felt right at home there.”",
      "Had United’s approach come earlier, Onana could perhaps have been lacing up his boots at Old Trafford now rather than Villa Park.",
      "Given the current drawbacks of the United midfield, there’s a good chance Onana would be starting there.",
      "That said, when fit, he has been an important member of Villa’s side. This season, either side of a hamstring injury, Onana has played seven times in the Premier League, starting six games and scoring once.",
      "That goal came in a 4-0 thrashing of Bournemouth last time out – who started the day above Villa – and pushed the Midlands outfit up to sixth in the table, within two points of third.",
      "As such, there is a sense that Villa could push on and continue to impress, as they have done for the last couple of seasons -finishing in the top six in both."

      "After binning off Vitor Pereira, Wolves toyed briefly with the idea of going fully mid-table Serie A and just bringing Gary O’Neil back for another go like some kind of West Midlands Genoa.",
      "Instead, they’re now going to bring Rob Edwards back to the Premier League, thus allowing a few good months with Middlesbrough to entirely erase all consequences of a double relegation with Luton.",
      "Nottingham Forest have already brought not one but two former Premier League managers back into Our League this season, Ange Postecoglou briefly and Sean Dyche for who knows how long, while West Ham got Nuno Espirito Santo back in a big manager’s chair barely two weeks after he left Forest in high dudgeon.",
      "In short, the managerial merry-go-round has never felt so back. So here are 10 more former Premier League managers we would very much like to see back somewhere this season, please.",
      "",
      "Just as well we’re keen, because it’s just definitely happening, isn’t it? Someone is going to take a punt on La Brendan and that is a huge boost for fans of insane self-regard and Premier League managers delivering unironic David Brentisms apparently lifted direct from the most unhinged corners of LinkedIn.",
      "The brilliant thing about Rodgers, and it’s a really clever part of his whole schtick, is that yes, he’s great fun, tremendously cringe, and you don’t necessarily really want him in charge of your club because everyone will take the p*ss; but he’s not actually a bad football manager, at least not straight away.",
      "That’s the genius of it. Anyone can be David Brent. But David Brent who’s actually competent at his job right up until he isn’t? Not even Gervais could pull that off.",
      "Rodgers is so tempting for all manner of mid-to-low-level Premier League clubs precisely because there is a very high chance of some short-term Leicester City-type gain before the longer-term Leicester City-type pain.",
      "You can absolutely see, say, Leeds going for it. And you can absolutely convince yourself that it might be a good idea. And it really might actually be a good idea, for around 18 months tops.",
      "So yeah, Leeds is a good option here. But we would also happily accept Forest just to see how (and, of course, how quickly) his departure from the City Ground manages to be even more acrimonious and dignity-shedding on all sides than his Celtic one. Because it somehow definitely would be that.",
      "",
      "We just really want him to be Liverpool manager. Because it would be funny and probably not go at all well and we just want to watch the world burn.",
      "He’s apparently third favourite for the job should Arne Slot manage to maintain his current relegation form long enough to get the actual sack, and it’s a grand shame for all who enjoy watching big clubs do daft, catastrophic things in real time that the current odds for any of that actually taking place misrepresent their true chances by many orders of magnitude.",
      "But a man can dream, while reluctantly contenting himself with watching whatever your Manchester Uniteds and the Tottenham Hotspurs of this world are up to. But it feels a bit ‘We have big football clubs doing daft, catastrophic things in real time at home’ if we’re honest. This really does mean more.",
      "",
      "We really need a ‘nepo baby’-like title for managers who owe their entire career in that particular field to their prowess as a player. We just can’t quite land on what it should be – something like ‘top-pro baby’ but not so lame.",
      "Anyway, the point here is that yes, we do really want to see Frank Lampard back managing in the Premier League but we want him to have earned it. We want, very specifically, to see him managing a Coventry City side that he has got promoted into the Premier League. We do not want to see him simply handed another Premier League job on a silver platter and Leeds, we are looking at you. Don’t make us tap the sign.",
      "We know this contradicts pretty much everything we just said about Lamps’ old sparring partner Steven Gerrard, but consider this: shut up.",
      "",
      "That now infamous throwaway podcast line about a potential Liverpool return turned everyone into Lloyd Christmas, but we understand the desperate desire people have to see Klopp and his heavy-metal football back in the Premier League.",
      "He was great to have around, produced a brilliant football team that won the lot in riotously entertaining fashion and was absolutely guaranteed to say something ridiculous and dangerously high in salt after any game that didn’t go well.",
      "He was, in short, the perfect Premier League manager and it hasn’t been the same without him. He isn’t coming back, we know he isn’t coming back, we should all accept he isn’t coming back but we all heard him telling us there’s a chance.",
      "",
      "Talking of great managers and hilariously salty losers, here he is. The Special One. The walking real-life meme. The man, the myth, the legend.",
      "Sure, he’s not really actually any good at being a football manager any more and is currently safely tucked away back in Portugal where he can’t really do any damage. But you can’t deny the Premier League is a better and more importantly funnier place with Jose sulking around the place.",
      "The good news is that through years of practice and training he has now managed to get his standard three-year destroy-and-exit down to around 18 months, so there’s every chance he’ll be available soon to pop up at somewhere like Newcastle and start being incredibly rude about anything and everyone while insisting on being shown great deferential respect himself because of some stuff he did at Chelsea over a decade ago.",
      "",
      "We miss him already. Again.",
      "The Premier League is just better vibes when the big Aussie barrel of contrasts is here, with his ability to deliver the world’s grumpiest post-match interviews and most profound and insightful and interesting pre-match interviews and being able, with nothing more than subtle shifts in intonation, to give the word ‘mate’ a range of meanings from, well, ‘mate’ to ‘the sh*t on my shoe’.",
      "And, of course, just losing loads and loads of football matches in increasingly silly and entertaining ways while refusing to learn a single lesson from it.",
      "We’re not the first to say it, but a manager who can say in September, when things are going badly wrong, and he is manager of f*cking Tottenham, that he’s going to win a trophy and then actually do it is just absolute cinema.",
      "That’s a manager you want in your league, even if not always necessarily at your club. Because, you know, of all the defeats.",
      "Our solution here is that every Premier League club should be required to employ Postecoglou for a six-to-18-month period on some kind of rota basis, for the culture and the greater good.",
      "",
      "A Proper Football Man. The next generation of Premier League firefighter. Spoke well at his Leeds/West Ham/Fulham/Forest/Burnley unveiling, I thought.",
      "",
      "We’re not sure where or how he might turn up back in the Premier League, to be honest. He’s one of the very best and most successful coaches in the world and that can be quite limiting, especially when you’ve developed something of a reputation for falling out with everybody and bringing everything crashing down around you by the end of your second season.",
      "It’s somehow even panning out that way at Napoli, despite winning the league in his first season and currently sitting two points off top spot 11 games into this. The usual rumblings and grumblings and dark complaints about transfer decisions the club has taken are all starting to surface.",
      "It just feels like the middle of the Venn Diagram of Premier League clubs who’d want Conte and Premier League clubs Conte would be interested in is vanishingly small.",
      "But we shouldn’t give up hope. In a world where Conte’s hair can magically grow back, all things are possible and we’re saying, as seems to be the case for so many of these ‘big enough to interest this great but flawed manager, small enough to go down this road’ type of situations, Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Still a part of us that expects him to turn up back at Spurs at some point in the future. Does feel like one of those situations where both he and they were happiest in those times and, while you probably shouldn’t go back, there is still some unfinished business.",
      "Weirdly, though, Pochettino seems to have managed to pull off something quite strange, in that having a short-lived spell at Chelsea has actually made it less likely rather than far, far more likely that he will go on to manage Spurs.",
      "We can’t explain the science of it, but for some reason Chelsea and then Spurs is absolutely fine, but Spurs and then Chelsea and then Spurs isn’t.",
      "Still, though, you’d like to think there’s a fourth Premier League job out there somewhere for a manager who did his best work here and managed to last over five years at Spurs, where two years is about the limit for absolutely everyone else.",
      "",
      "Just be nice to have the 2026 World Cup-winning manager in the Barclays next season, we reckon.",
      "But we’re not sure Luis de la Fuente is particularly up for it, so we’ll have to settle for the return of Tuchel instead.",
      "Even Ruben Amorim might have doubted that he would make it through a year at Man Utd. But the manager reaches his anniversary feeling more empowered than ever…",
      "Liverpool fans either think Arne Slot has to be sacked or believe that the Reds have been incredibly unlucky. Where do you sit?",
      "Liverpool are a complete mess and must take their spending way beyond £400m to fix themselves, with five players needing to be replaced with upgrades…",
      "You can’t win a beauty contest just by being the biggest spendthrift, as much as clubs labour under the delusion that they can.",
      "Arsenal are title favourites because they are top of the actual table, but also because of a huge improvement in one Liverpool are struggling in.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has picked out the three players key to Manchester United’s recent improvement under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese boss was being tipped for the Old Trafford sack for the first couple of months of the campaign, which featured Premier League defeats to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford, as well as the harrowing League Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "But a run of five Premier League games unbeaten to lift United to seventh in the Premier League has granted Amorim breathing space and hope for the future of the club, with a number of players – old and new – producing fine individual performances.",
      "When asked who United’s ‘most important player right now’ is, Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “I don’t think it’s one man. It can’t be down to one man. [Matthijs] De Ligt has been our best defender this season, he is even adding goals for us, like the last-minute goal the other day.",
      "“But in terms of his his press, he’s assertive and has willingness to go into foreign areas of the pitch to defend at right times. His clearing out of his box is brilliant.",
      "“[Bryan] Mbeumo has been a joke as well. He’s really stepped in and been a mainstay and is someone who can give us two or three seconds on the ball, score important goals for us, create chances.",
      "“I saw Thomas Frank’s comments about him yesterday, being a complete winger. I think, by the end of the season, he will be one of the most complete wingers in the league. He can do everything, he just needs to keep consistently doing that in a red shirt.”",
      "Amorim will be without Mbeumo over the Christmas period and into the new year when the Cameroonian heads to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "And the United boss admitted that his absence may lead the Red Devils hierarchy to push for reinforcements in January.",
      "“Of course, we are going to have a problem there, but we already knew that,” he said. “So the management of that situation is going to be hard.”",
      "“But let’s see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to repair something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.”",
      "Ferdinand also named Senne Lammens, who joined from Royal Antwerp for £22m in the summer, as another key player in their upturn.",
      "The 23-year-old spent the first three games on the bench but has now asserted himself as United’s No.1 ahead of Altay Bayindir after Andre Onana joined Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "“And the goalkeeper,” Ferdinand continued. “You can’t talk about anyone being our most important player without the goalkeeper.",
      "“It is no coincidence with our upturn in form that we have a goalkeeper it seems all our players trust.”",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand insists it was “brilliant” to see Virgil van Dijk call out Wayne Rooney’s criticism of the Liverpool defender.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has rejected Gary Lineker’s claim that Arsenal star Victor Gyokeres must start scoring against top teams to avoid “flat-track bully” label.",
      "Rio Ferdinand doesn’t think £65m for Luis Diaz was “good business” for Liverpool. We’re confident it was very good business, actually.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has hit out at Jamie Carragher over his ‘disrespect’ of a Man Utd star who’s proven him wrong under Ruben Amorim this season."

But perhaps the biggest indication that Arsenal have evolved is that the two wins which propelled them to the top of the table heading into the October international break came in fixtures they lost last campaign: Newcastle (a) and West Ham (h). Then they won at Craven Cottage for the first time in well over two years, and beat Crystal Palace at home having drawn to them in April.",

      "No club has been picked for more Premier League TV games than Manchester United, with a surprise team alongside them and ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Chelsea) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Sunderland) – £45m",
      "5th (Spurs) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Aston Villa) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Manchester United) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Liverpool) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Bournemouth) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Crystal Palace) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Brighton) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Brentford) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Everton) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Newcastle) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Fulham) – £15.9m",

      "19th (Nottingham Forest) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Spurs and Sunderland were the biggest winners from the second December and first January selections with four more games each.",
      "Brighton, Burnley, West Ham and Wolves only had two more matches picked.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (18 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £15.4m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (17 games) – worth around £14.6m",
      "=8th) Manchester City and Newcastle (16 games) – worth around £13.7m",
      "10th) Leeds (15 games) – worth around £12.9m",
      "=11th) Brentford, Crystal Palace, Everton, Fulham and West Ham (13 games) – worth around £11.4m",
      "16th) Wolves (11 games) – worth around £9.7m",
      "=17th) Bournemouth, Brighton and Sunderland (10 games) – worth around £8.9m",
      "20th) Burnley (8 games) – worth around £7.3m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Even Ruben Amorim might have doubted that he would make it through a year at Man Utd. But the manager reaches his anniversary feeling more empowered than ever…",
      "Here are 10 more former Premier League managers we would very much like to see back somewhere this season, please…",
      "Liverpool fans either think Arne Slot has to be sacked or believe that the Reds have been incredibly unlucky. Where do you sit?",
      "Liverpool are a complete mess and must take their spending way beyond £400m to fix themselves, with five players needing to be replaced with upgrades…",
      "You can’t win a beauty contest just by being the biggest spendthrift, as much as clubs labour under the delusion that they can.",
      "Arsenal are title favourites because they are top of the actual table, but also because of a huge improvement in one Liverpool are struggling in."

      "“I see Alex Scott has been called up by England so I would have thought Jimmy Garner’s form as a midfield player wouldn’t have been a million miles off that either,” said the admittedly slightly biased David Moyes of a player who has outlined his seasonal objective “to get there or thereabouts with the England squad”.",
      "Garner is doing his candidacy no harm as a remarkably versatile and durable 24-year-old playing regularly for a team just outside the top half.",
      "The talent pool is realistically far too deep for him to make a splash but Everton are benefiting from his ambition. Garner has not missed a single minute all season in all competitions and was central to a tactical shift Moyes finally implemented against Fulham.",
      "Tim Iroegbunam was trusted to provide energy and perhaps the single greatest assist in Premier League history, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall embracing an all-action, duel-winning role further forward as Garner brought far more balance to the team when making his first start at right-back in over a year.",

      "In the space of a fortnight he has muscled in on a pair of Big Six defences to earn Sunderland an extra three points in stoppage time.",
      "Only two players who have yet to start a Premier League game this season have still managed to score or assist more than a single goal. While Federico Chiesa labours to prove something to Arne Slot, there is little doubt that Regis Le Bris fully appreciates the “different profile” his chaotic Mr. Brobbey offers.",

      "Even though that process was expedited somewhat, Canvot proved himself a player who can be tentatively trusted to perform at the necessary level already.",
      "Eight clearances, three tackles, two interceptions and even four fouls committed nowhere near danger – three were in Brighton’s final third and the other was on the halfway line – combined with composure and security on the ball suggests Palace might have found another defensive gem who is perfectly attuned to their needs.",

      "That is some absolutely textbook caretaker managering, down to a team selection which ticked some fan-service boxes – Jackson Tchatchoua at right-back, Marshall Munetsi and Jhon Arias dropped, the club’s two best players actually playing and a teenage academy graduate being given the first substantial Premier League minutes of his career – a much-improved first half in terms of spirit and application, and an eventual and entirely inevitable defeat before immediately handing the mess over to a doomed permanent appointment.",
      "Godspeed, *checks notes* James Collins. The nondescript name is a sublime touch.",
      "",
      "It cannot be often that a visiting player makes the most passes of anyone at the Etihad. But then that was part of the plan for Pep Guardiola: he identified Konate as a weak point and specifically ensured the ball was funnelled out to him as often as possible.",
      "Only four players in the entire league have made more errors leading to an opposition shot this season. And going by the statistics, Konate did not add to that tally against Manchester City. But he did make the biggest mistake leading to a penalty, deflected the first goal in off his head after barely jumping, and welcomed Jeremy Doku inside like an old friend to score.",
      "Konate was dreadful and Liverpool should start confiscating everyone’s phones so they can block Duolingo.",

      "The Newcastle manager insisted after yet another defeat having led that “I’m never going to do the same thing continually and expect a different result”. But the same players who had failed the previous week were trusted to deliver here.",
      "It is no coincidence that one of the two changes Howe made to his starting line-up provided Newcastle’s best performance of a painful bunch. Harvey Barnes scored a wonderful goal in place of Anthony Gordon but beyond that, it was more of the same: a questionable keeper, a vulnerable defence, a weak midfield, an impotent attack and a team devoid of confidence.",
      "The sack and relegation chat will carry through the black hole of an international break. Something is certainly not right. It is remarkably stark that having dropped the fewest points from winning positions of any Premier League club last season (seven), they have dropped the most so far this campaign (nine).

      "It is tough to look past him as Manchester United’s current biggest problem.",
      "His personal goal difference is abysmal, beaten by just 35 players in the whole league, all of whom play for teams in the bottom five. Ugarte, a £50.5m midfielder for the side in seventh, has been on the pitch for four Manchester United goals and 11 against.",
      "That is sometimes a coincidence and not his responsibility to bear. But against Spurs he was beaten by Wilson Odobert in the build up to the first goal and played Richarlison onside for the second.",
      "It is genuinely borderline impressive to play 304 (30.7%) of a club’s 990 minutes but be present for 11 (61.1%) of the 18 goals they have conceded, even if not always – but usually – culpable.",
      "And that omits the Grimsby Town defeat in which he was substituted at half time.",
      "The Manchester United player with the best personal goal difference? Casemiro on +8. That reflects abysmally on the player who usually replaces him.",
      "",
      "The bigger issue for Burnley is and was always going to be conceding goals, but ultimately when your otherwise excellent keeper flaps a couple into his own net there is no need for an extensive defensive post-mortem.",
      "Far stranger is the £15.4m Belgian international elephant in the room. Tresor continues to await not only his first league appearance since joining the Clarets permanently in summer 2024, but his maiden league matchday squad.",
      "Actual Bayern Munich manager Vincent Kompany suggested the Championship would be “a good step” for Tresor “into giving this team what we know he is able to give” after his struggle for minutes on loan in 2023/24. But Parker has given the 26-year-old one solitary hour of game time across three substitute cameos in the FA and Carabao Cups in the last 15 months.",
      "Tresor got an assist in two of those games; only Quilindschy Hartman has set up more goals for the Clarets this season. Is that not an option worth exploring, especially after the chairman called him a “tremendous talents” who he would “love to see have the opportunity” at a fan forum last month? And if not, why not?",

      "They have taken two points from the four games in which they have had more than 55 per cent possession this season, and ten from the four in which they have had 45 per cent or less. There are game-state intricacies to take into account but it does seem as though Brighton have a low block problem.",

      "Ally McCoist and former Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster have picked out lots of positives after the Red Devils held Tottenham to a 2-2 draw on Saturday.",
      "Spurs thought they had won the game when Richarlison put Thomas Frank’s side ahead in second half injury time after Bryan Mbeumo and Mathys Tel had scored earlier in the match.",
      "But Matthijs de Ligt popped up in the sixth minute of injury time to salvage a point from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and keep Man Utd on a run of five Premier League matches unbeaten.",
      "Many onlookers were underwhelmed by the performance of both teams but McCoist and Foster can see the positives in recent weeks.",
      "McCoist thinks Man Utd are now “harder to play against”, “better in forward areas” and more resilient, while he picked out Amad Diallo and Patrick Dorgu for their good displays against Tottenham.",
      "Speaking to host Jeff Stelling on talkSPORT, McCoist said: “I also think Jeff, in times gone by they wouldn’t have got the point. I think there’s more about them, it’s evident. There’s far more about them. Miles away from the finished article it has to be said. But they look slightly harder to play against, and they certainly look, I think, better in forward areas.",
      "READ: Man Utd could revert to type as two summer signings justify Ruben Amorim’s new transfer priority",
      "“Some good performances. I thought Dorgu played well. I thought Amad played really, really well. We’ve mentioned Cunha and Mbeumo before. Those two in particular, at this early stage, I think two terrific new signings can handle it, not even handle it, look as though they’re thriving in that kind of situation.",
      "“So I think at this early stage, there’s must be heaps of positives from Manchester United, but still a lot of work to do. But I take your point. They’re disappointed at getting the point, but I think maybe, you know, certainly last season, I don’t think they’re getting the point.”",
      "When asked if he sensed a changing attitude at Man Utd, former goalkeeper Ben Foster added: “Yeah, I think Ally’s probably just said everything that needed to be said right there. I only watched the game on the TV, but they look okay.",
      "“They look like they’re playing with a lot more confidence and have done for most of this season. But I just think when you sort of contrast it to the quality of Man City, for example, last night, I think it’s very evident there’s still quite a way to go.”",
      "McCoist added: “I think that’s in a nutshell, mate, I really do. I think there’s definitely been improvements. I think the positivity around Manchester United is understandable. And so there should be the small steps, but in terms of the large steps needed to get to the likes of the level of Manchester City, which we saw yesterday, they are still a good bit away.",
      "“But I still think Amorim speaks really well better, don’t you think? And I think I actually think it was a good piece of ownership coming out and effectively backing him for a couple of years so that everybody knows [he’s going to be there a while]. And just as importantly, never mind the fans knowing, I think the players knowing that he’s going to be there for a while is something as well.”",
      "Foster continued: “I think people just tend to forget that the Premier League is actually really hard. To be honest, the general quality of the Premier League is really, really hard and to put a string of games together [is difficult].",
      "“We’re saying it all over the Premier League, but a string of games together where you’re winning consistently is really, really hard to do. So sometimes you just have to make sure you don’t lose. And I think for Manchester United, they would have lost that game earlier in the season, they would have lost that game.",
      "“They wouldn’t have had it about them to go and really search for that equaliser. I think it’s the mentality shift, the mentality change in the players. They’re all starting to buy into it now, from what the manager is saying. He’s been saying it for the best part of the year, in fairness to him – but I think it’s finally seeping into the players, and you can see when players play with that belief, and that positivity and the confidence, that you get better results for it as well.”",
      "Five pundits give their predictions as Liverpool face Man Utd on Sunday looking to an end a run of three straight defeats in all competitions.",
      "Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be given “more time” at Old Trafford amid sack rumours.",
      "Rangers legend Ally McCoist has changed his Premier League title prediction after backing Liverpool before the season kicked off.",
      "Ruben Amorim “has got a couple of months left” at Man Utd, according to Ben Foster, but one of his likely replacements has a big “worry” hanging over him.",
      "Premier League legend David Beckham has tipped Newcastle to “surprise” people in this season’s Champions League, while Ben Foster believes Nick Woltemade is “made for” the Magpies.",
      "Man Utd have been told by Ben Foster that they made a “panic buy” on the deadline day when they brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp."

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. Though against Manchester United, you might wonder if he could have done more to keep out the two headers that beat him.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford and Brighton, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. A slight fall here after conceding two to Arsenal. Leandro Trossard’s rocket was unstoppable, but Roefs never quite got himself in the right shape to deal better with Bukayo Saka’s leveller. He retains the highest saves percentage in the league, though.",
      "",
      "Lammens continues to dazzle United fans with simple competency. The Belgian made a couple of fine saves at Spurs and could do little to stop either of the hosts’ goals.",
      "",
      "A first clean sheet in seven sees Pickford climb here. The England keeper just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "Still only David Raya has kept more clean sheets than Pope whose England recall has been scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "One of the biggest climbers in recent weeks. Conceded six over trips to Brighton and Forest but the combined PSxG was 7.9.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric during his last Prem appearance at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good in the first of their four consecutive Premier League defeats – before feeling a twang in the next game at Galatasaray.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. No biggie for Dan Ballard’s opener, but the Black Cats’ late leveller would have been prevented had Raya not rushed from his goal.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",
      "Prior to a comparatively comfortable outing against Leeds, last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list, from a position of strength to somewhere a lot less competent. Conceding direct from a corner against Bournemouth and then from around 30 yards didn’t help his cause. Little Sels could do about either of Manchester United’s goals but Big John is still breathing down his neck.",
      "",

      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow.",

      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",

      "“You can speak about it, but you’ve got to represent that on the pitch and prove that you deserve it.”",

      "On Guerra, the report adds ‘Although he was under contract until 2029 with a €100 million release clause, the club knows they could let him go for between €20 and €25 million. This reduction reflects the fact that the player is no longer performing at the required level, and the time seems right to sell.’",

In England, they see him as a versatile midfielder with good physique and stamina, who could adapt to the Red Devils’ system. The English club believe they can acquire him for a reduced fee compared to what Valencia asked for a year ago, precisely because of the player’s current situation.’",

      "Ruben Amorim ‘wants another attacker in January’ and it’s easy to see why, as Manchester United are already over-reliant on two summer signings…",
      "It was unusual to watch from a distance as Man Utd were actually competent in this summer’s transfer window, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s recruitment team oversaw their positive overhaul.",
      "Their measured approach ensured the Red Devils bided their time to land most of their top summer targets, with this much-needed model shift ensuring that they were not plagued by poor recruitment as they had in virtually every window since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.",
      "Understandably, Amorim‘s side placed most of their focus on signing upgrades in attacking positions after they were toothless in forward areas in 2024/25.",
      "Around £200m was invested to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko before they landed Senne Lammens in the final days of the window to replace former No.1 goalkeeper Andre Onana.",
      "READ: Amorim blushes spared by De Ligt as Frank outclasses Man Utd boss from the touchline",
      "It is also worth noting that the Premier League giants were equally astute with offloading players, with Tyrell Malacia the only member of their so-called ‘bomb squad’ not to be sent elsewhere in the summer on permanent or loan-to-buy deals.",
      "These factors have contributed to Man Utd’s improvement under Amorim, as there have been clear signs of progression; their ongoing five-game run in the Premier League has seen them shoot up the table.",
      "So, United are on track, but there is still a lot of work to be done if they are to return to challenging for the Premier League and/or Champions League under this current regime.",
      "Lammens is a clear improvement on Onana but cannot be deemed the next Peter Schmeichel yet, while Sesko possesses the natural qualities to come good once he’s up to speed with Premier League life.",
      "They and most other Man Utd players have been massively overshadowed by Mbeumo and Cunha, though.",
      "Man Utd’s lack of a suitable No.10 for Amorim’s formation was a key factor behind their attacking woes last season, with this issue eased by the arrivals of Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "The two forwards have immediately hit the ground running at Man Utd, having arrived with Premier League experience and the character to relish rather than flounder under the spotlight at Old Trafford.",
      "Mbeumo, who deserved his October Player of the Month award, grabbed his sixth Premier League goal involvement for Man Utd against Spurs. Cunha, meanwhile, has been less prolific but has been equally important with his chance creation and work rate.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo’s performances have reached such a level that they are already among a handful of Man Utd’s most indispensable assets, as their attitude, intensity and decision-making have exposed Joshua Zirkzee, Mason Mount and last season’s options, who are levels below their two standouts.",
      "It is brilliant for Man Utd that Cunha and Mbeumo have made such an impact, but United’s overreliance on these two players poses a serious problem for Amorim in the coming/weeks.",
      "United will be without Mbeumo and Amad Diallo for most of December due to the African Cup of Nations, while there is also the looming threat of another injury to Cunha.",
      "Without one or two of these players, there would be a severe drop-off in the quality and efficiency of Man Utd’s attack, with Cunha and Mbeumo justifying Amorim’s reported new demand for ‘another attacker’ to be signed in January.",
      "It has also been widely reported that the Red Devils are aware that they need a new No.6, though Casemiro’s recent resurgence has made signing Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton less of a necessity for January.",
      "Instead, ‘another attacker’ is their actual priority for the January window as Man Utd face reverting to their 2024/25 toothlessness once they are without Mbeumo and/or Cunha for an extended period, as they do not currently have the necessary depth to ward off a sudden decline.",
      "Daniel Farke is the clear frontrunner, but Eddie Howe is now second favourite in the Sack Race after another Newcastle defeat and Arne Slot is far from safe.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been tipped to replace two players in January, while Matheus Cunha’s impact on the team has been “exaggerated”.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim reportedly wants a new attacker in the January transfer window amid Benjamin Sesko’s underwhelming performances.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will be a significant miss when he heads to AFCON with Cameroon, but Owen Hargreaves reckons Manchester United are “good enough” to cope.",
      "Thomas Frank and Ruben Amorim took it in turns to make bad decisions in their bid to lose a game which neither Tottenham nor Man Utd therefore deserved to win.",
      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United."

      "Arsenal are still hot favourites despite conceding a couple of actual goals at Sunderland, while the silliness literally everywhere else sees Tottenham in the top six despite having five points from six games at home, and newly promoted Sunderland sat looking down on three of the Big Six a quarter of the way through the season, just like everyone predicted.",
      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid on Sunday.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have picked up a win now, which was over Leeds and brings an ever harsher spotlight on Daniel Farke.",
      "And suddenly Eddie Howe is looking a bit nervous too.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but it’s looking more and more positive at home and in Europe, and going into the international break on the back of a 4-0 win over a very good Bournemouth side is a lovely place to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been two wins from two since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously third in the league.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 11th in the table after 11 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 20Premier League games, and just one from six very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raised the stakes. A thumping Champions League win over Copenhagen and a very stupid draw against Manchester United is probably just about enough to keep him out of the international break firing line.",
      "",
      "Four points from two games against Manchester United and Leeds has given Forest the lift they badly needed and leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "Back-to-back wins over Newcastle and Burnley mean it’s a comfier interlull than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable and leaves Liverpool languishing in eighth.",
      "",
      "We still think they’d regret it if they pull the trigger, but it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "Hitting the November international break outside the bottom three does feel like it counts as mission thus far accomplished, but defeat in a six-pointer at West Ham has removed all wriggle room.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and what is now officially an iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. League position can mislead given the congestion behind Arsenal and a bloated mid-table, but Newcastle are now closer to the bottom three than they are to 13th-placed Everton, and whatever the mitigation that just won’t do.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest. It’s deep trouble now.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘wants another attacker in January’ and it’s easy to see why, as Manchester United are already overly reliant on two summer signings…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim reportedly wants a new attacker in the January transfer window amid Benjamin Sesko’s underwhelming performances.",
      "Thomas Frank and Ruben Amorim took it in turns to make bad decisions in their bid to lose a game which neither Tottenham nor Man Utd therefore deserved to win.",
      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United.",
      "Amorim could easily have defended Sesko to the hilt after Neville’s ‘awkward’ criticism of the striker. What he actually did stands the Man Utd striker in good stead.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants to retain the services of a key Man Utd pair he’s ‘really happy’ with beyond the end of the season."

      "Liverpool, are you f***ing this up?",
      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played six, lost five in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an eight-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "Liverpool now also trail in forlornly behind Manchester City, Chelsea, Sunderland Tottenham, Aston Villa and – most humiliating of all – Manchester United.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",

      "But he’s now bagged four in as many games and is becoming increasingly influential under Amorim.",
      "There’s one slight problem: Mbeumo will go to AFCON in mid-December and might not return until late January.",
      "The tournament kicks off on December 21, and Cameroon’s first match is against Gabon two days later.",
      "Should Mbeumo go to AFCON, he will likely miss Man Utd’s Premier League match against Aston Villa and will definitely miss games against Newcastle United (home) and Wolves (home).",
      "If Cameroon progress from a group consisting of themselves, Gabon, Ivory Coast and Mozambique, Mbeumo will also miss the trip to Leeds United.",
      "Should Cameroon reach the final, he would miss Burnley away (January 7), Manchester City at home (January 17), and the third round of the FA Cup (weekend starting January 10).",
      "So, the fewest number of games Mbeumo will miss is two, though that relies on him joining up with the Cameroon squad less than 48 hours before their first match.",
      "Non-penalty league goals since the start of last season:",

      "Not bad company to be with for Bryan Mbeumo 🤷 pic.twitter.com/Ond7PWRQsu",
      "Mbeumo will be a big miss for Man Utd, but he’s not the only one expected to be away.",
      "Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are also likely to represent their countries at AFCON, with the former potentially being a loss on the same level as Mbeumo.",
      "Discussing those absences, former Man Utd midfielder Owen Hargreaves admitted it will be “tricky” for Amorim, but believes the squad is “good enough” to cope.",
      "He said: “I mean, that’s going to be tricky, but again, hopefully without so many games, they can keep the squad healthy and rotate players. [Benjamin] Sesko is an interesting one – they’ll need him, but we’ll have to see what happens with that injury.",
      "“I think the squad’s good enough, and without European football – I know it’s a miss for the club – but it could actually help them get back into the top four. Let’s not forget, it’s probably top five this season, and if they get back into the Champions League places, then that’s been a good season.”",
      "Mbeumo has been available every matchday and is growing increasingly influential. Amad, meanwhile, is also consistently showing his importance as Amorim’s first-choice right-wing-back, though he started in an attacking role against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "Both players are key, and Mazraoui is a solid depth option, so their absence will be felt. But if the whole project comes crashing down without them, serious questions will be asked of Amorim and his squad. Realistically, a club with such large transfer expenditure over the last three years has no excuse not to cope.",
      "In terms of replacements, you’d expect Mason Mount to start regularly if he’s fit. That’s hardly a huge downgrade, though he’s a very different player and much less of a goal threat. Joshua Zirkzee is another option and has barely featured this season, so he’ll expect more minutes during the AFCON period.",
      "As for Amad, Diogo Dalot likely fills in at right-wing-back, especially with Mazraoui away as well.",
      "TL;DR: Yes, and it’ll be bloody embarrassing if they don’t cope.",

      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",

      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",

      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",

      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",

      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
