      "The new Premier League season is just a few days away but the transfer fun doesn't end for a little longer. Deadline day isn't until September 1, meaning teams have three weeks from today to complete their summer business.",
      "Plenty of those big deals have already been done. Some were wrapped up early, such as Florian Wirtz's move to Liverpool and Joao Pedro's Chelsea switch, but others have taken a little longer.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres completed his move to Arsenal after the Gunners began their pre-season campaign, though he has had time to start two friendlies and score in one. Benjamin Sesko's Manchester United switch took a little longer, with the striker unveiled as United took on Fiorentina on Saturday, and a behind-closed-doors friendly could give him the opportunity to make his debut for the club.",
      "Liverpool have been te biggest spenders among Premier League clubs this summer, with Fulham the quietest in the market. Things could easily change in the coming weeks, though - especially if certain teams start the season slowly.",
      "The big what-if remaining this summer concerns Isak's future. Liverpool have already seen one bid rejected, but the Newcastle striker still appears keen on an Anfield move.",
      "The issue is that Newcastle are desperate not to sell. It's been a frustrating window for Eddie Howe's side when it comes to landing targets - with several players opting for moves elsewhere - and losing Isak would only add to the nightmare summer.",
      "Liverpool have sold Luis DIaz and Darwin Nunez, though, and have a hole in their attack. Newcastle would surely want a replacement sorted first, though - more on that later.",
      "If Isak does join Liverpool, he would likely become the most expensive signing in Premier League history. Jack Grealish once held that honour, and the England international might well act as a cautionary tale.",
      "Yes, Grealish helped current club Manchester City win the treble in 2022-23, but things have gone south since. He is very much surplus to requirements this summer, and will be allowed to leave if a suitable offer arrives.",
      "Everton looks like a good fit, and would give David Moyes a marquee signing for the first season at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Even a loan wouldn't be cheap, though, and the Toffees will need to decide wether their limited funds are better used elsewhere, but reports on Monday suggested they decided it is worth the gamble.",
      "Liverpool created chances in the Community Shield on Sunday, but were left wanting at the back at times. Despite the excitement of a potential deal for Isak, there will be some who feel a new centre-back is more important.",
      "Marc Guehi has already been the subject of a couple of Reds bids, though they've fallen short of Crystal Palace's valuation so far. Guehi only has one yet left on his contract, though, and a late offer could yet get the job done.",
      "\"Of course, for players of that calibre to leave on a free, it is a problem for a football club,\" Palace chairman Steve Parish said when asked about £50m-rated Guehi. \"There is no doubt about it unfortunately.\"",
      "Guehi might not be the only one leaving Selhurst Park this summer. He played on Sunday, as did Ebere Eze, but Eze remains a target for Arsenal.",
      "The Gunners have already signed Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres, among others. Eze would offer something different in the final third, though, and would allow the Gunners to cash in on Leandro Trossard.",
      "\"Let's see what happens in terms of where the squad is in the next few weeks, but we are actively looking at options, as well there are a few players maybe that they have to leave as well so we'll be open to see what happens,\" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said after a weekend friendly win over Athletic Club.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur moved early to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, but James Maddison's injury could force them back into the market. Maddison will miss the majority of the season with an ACL injury which requires surgery, and Savinho is one of the players linked with a North London switch after that news broke.",
      "The winger impressed in flashes during his first Manchester City season. Pep Guardiola's side added Rayan Cherki over the summer, though, and te Frenchman appears more likely to get minutes this term.",
      "City would be looking to make a profit on the £34m they paid to sign Savinho from Troyes last summer. He is said to be open to an exit, too, so this is worth keeping an eye on.",
      "Manchester United sealed their Benjamin Sesko deal on Saturday, and now the task is offloading some fringe players. Marcus Rashford has already completeed a loan move to Barcelona, and Sancho might be next.",
      "Chelsea paid United to get out of a permanent move for the winger, who blew hot and cold on loan last term. Juventus continue to be linked, along with Serie A rivals Inter Milan, with a complex PSR situation developing.",
      "United are keen to comply with profit and sustainability rules by sending Sancho and others away. Juve also need to balance the books, though, and we may need to see exits for the likes of Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic before there's any movement in the other direction.",
      "Staying with United exits, Garnacho is another player who has potential suitors. Chelsea are believed to have agreed terms with the Argentine, but there's still work to be done on the fee.",
      "United wanted £70m for Garnacho back in January, and that was considered too steep for Chelsea and Napoli. A move to Stamford Bridge this summer could still happen, though.",
      "Ruben Amorim certainly appears to have no space for Garnacho, who was left out of pre-season matches. The same applies to left-back Tyrell Malacia, though there has been less interest in the former Feyenoord man.",
      "Chelsea have strengthened in attacking areas, with Estevao Willian joined by strikers Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. The supporting cast could use some new blood, though, especially with Madueke moving on.",
      "It's for this reason that Garnacho might not be the only addition. Xavi Simons of RB Leipzig has been eyed for a while, and Leipzig's failure to qualify for Europe could make a deal possible.",
      "Chelsea have been keen to send a player the other way, though, and this is where the problems lie. Christopher Nkunku could ultimately return to his former club, but it sounds like he'd need to take a wage hit.",
      "If Leipzig are after a Simons successor, Elliott looks like a good fit. The England Under-21 star struggled for minutes at Liverpool last season, and Wirt'z arrival will make game time even harder to come by.",
      "Liverpool are looking for around £50m for the former Fulham man, though a lower initial sum plus a buy-back clause is another option. The Bundesliga may suit him well, too, especially if he gets the minutes denied him under Arne Slot.",
      "A big season in Germany might even offer Elliott an England opportunity as we approach the World Cup. Thomas Tuchel will have eyes on the Bundesliga already, with captain Harry Kane at Bayern Munich, and a strong campaign would be hard to ignore.",
      "Speaking of Liverpool players who might find themselves on the move, Tsimikas is way down the pecking order. Andy Robertson is still at Anfield and Milos Kerkez has joined the party, leaving Tsimikas as the odd man out.",
      "The Greek international has been of interest to Forest for a while. With Alex Moreno back at parent club Aston Villa after a loan at the City Ground, a new left-back seems like an obvious priority for Nuno's side.",
      "Forest will play Europa League football this season after rivals Crystal Palace lost an appeal against their European demotion. We may well see them become one of the busier sides in the market now that a resolution has arrived.",
      "It may be that Hojlund decides to stay and battle it out with Sesko for minutes at Old Trafford. If he decides against it, though, Milan could provide a way out.",
      "The Danish striker showed promise in his first Serie A spell at Atalanta, prompting Manchester United to break the bank to sign him. Milan would be paying considerably less than £72m, though.",
      "Juventus striker Vlahovic is another option for the Rossoneri. However, Hojlund may well come on lower wages and a hunger to make up for lost time.",
      "Back to Newcastle, who you'd imagine will need at least one new striker if Isak leaves. They may need one regardless, having allowed Callum Wilson - now at West Ham - to leave upon the expiry of his contract.",
      "Jackson missed out on Chelsea's last two 'weekender' friendlies amid reported interest. Delap and Joao Pedro have seen him relegated to the status of third-choice striker, but he could yet be reintegrated.",
      "The issue here is Chelsea's steep asking price. Newcastle are unlikely to be prepared to pay anywhere near the £80m the Blues want for a player who scored 10 league goals last term.",
      "If Newcastle only sign one striker, Wissa could well be the one. The Congolese star comfortably outscored Jackson last term despite playing for a mid-table finisher in Brentford, though he is a fair bit older than the Magpies' other target.",
      "Early offers in the region of £25m have been rejected by the Bees, both in January from Nottingham Forest and more recently. It looks like £35m could get the deal done, though.",
      "Wissa has been back in Brentford training and could yet feature against Forest in te league opener. It may well be a different story in September.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have completely revamped their attack in the summer transfer window, spending over £200million in an attempt to improve upon their dreadful 2024/25 campaign, but they are not done yet.",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha (£62.5m from Wolves), Bryan Mbeumo (£71m from Brentford) and Benjamin Sesko (£74m from RB Leipzig). They have also welcomed left-back Diego Leon from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in a deal which could reach £7m.",
      "Amorim’s side begin their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on Sunday, but still have lots of business left to do before the transfer window closes on September 1. Having finished 15th and lost the Europa League final last season, improvements were obviously required and the club hope to get further additions through the door.",
      "Speaking earlier in the summer, Amorim explained the blueprint for their targets. “We want players who have proved [themselves] already,\" he said. “Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all those boxes with them, we are going to do it.”",
      "The next priority for the former Sporting Lisbon boss is a deep lying midfielder. Amorim fielded Casemiro alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in their final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday, but the veteran doesn’t have the legs to perform the role. Manuel Ugarte has been unconvincing since his £50m arrival from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, while Kobbie Mainoo is better as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Carlos Baleba is a transfer target for the position, but Brighton’s £100m valuation – backed up by the fact he has three years on his contract – may make that deal extremely difficult to conclude. They have previously been linked with Atalanta midfielder Ederson, who is valued at around £52m, and Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand, who Amorim knows well.",
      "The other main transfer priority is in goal, where Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have failed to convince. United have been linked with Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez, PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma and Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Onana is expected to stay put and United would likely need to secure the exit of Bayindir before they signed a new goalkeeper. Lammens is the most realistic of the three aforementioned keepers, with Antwerp having already signed his replacement, although PSG are reportedly ready to wave goodbye to Donnarumma for a knockdown price.",
      "The problem for United is that they need to sell players before they can buy. Having started the summer with five members of their ‘bomb squad’, there are still four in situ, with Marcus Rashford the only one to leave so far and Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia still on the books.",
      "Garnacho is the subject of interest from Chelsea, who first enquired in January about the winger’s availability. He has agreed personal terms with the Blues over a permanent transfer but negotiations are ongoing over a transfer fee.",
      "Sancho had appeared close to joining Galatasaray and Juventus before those moves went quiet. He is still being linked with a move to Italy, with Inter Milan and Roma reportedly keen, while a return to Borussia Dortmund is a possibility.",
      "Antony wants to rejoin Real Betis, where he was on loan last season, but United are holding out for a permanent transfer for the highest price possible. Meanwhile, United have received little interest in Malacia, whose career with the club has been ruined by injuries.",
      "The arrival of Sesko has placed the future of Rasmus Hojlund in serious doubt. United are willing to sell the Danish striker for around £30m and there is interest from Italy in the form of AC Milan, where he still has a good reputation thanks to his spell at Atalanta.",
      "Another possible departure concerns Toby Collyer, who is well down the pecking order in Amorim’s squad. The midfielder didn’t make it off the bench against Fiorentina and could be sent out on loan in order to get regular game time; he and left-back Harry Amass are reportedly being targeted by crisis-stricken Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Premier League bosses will have to learn THREE new law changes ahead of the 2025-26 season after organisers confirmed some pretty major tweaks. Preparations for the new campaign are already well underway.",
      "All 20 Premier League clubs start their seasons over the next week, with reigning champions Liverpool kicking off the new campaign on Friday as they welcome Bournemouth to Anfield.",
      "Pre-season friendlies and transfers have both been high on the agenda as the season approaches. And while that is set to continue - with the window open for another three weeks - work has also had to be put into learning some new laws of the game.",
      "Gone are the days of goalkeepers just simply holding onto the ball to kill time at the end of a game. There was previously a rule where goalkeepers would be under a time limit of six seconds and should they not release the ball then an indirect free kick would be given - albeit it was rarely enforced.",
      "But the Premier League have toughened up their approach. The time limit has actually increased to eight seconds but the referee will now warn goalkeepers with a five-second countdown.",
      "And should they fail to release the ball before that timer expires then a corner would be awarded to the opposing team. That news will be music to the ears of Liverpool boss Arne Slot, who complained at the amount of time wasting his side faced last season.",
      "He said: “Teams got to know us better and tried to find answers to our playing style. But one of the things you cannot do anything about is that tactics are being used that have nothing to do with football.",
      "“Delaying the start of the game, pretending you are injured, taking one minute for a free-kick, one minute for a throw-in. That is my main worry.",
      "“Every time we drop points, that happened… goalkeepers taking one and a half minutes. When we have dropped points, that tactic was used. I like to say it now after us winning the league, not losing a game.”",
      "After previously restricting the amount of players who could engage with referees, the Premier League have now made that rule stricter with only captains allowed to approach officials in matches this season.",
      "Referees have the power to caution players who approach officials without permission or who show disrespectful behaviour. Should a team’s captain be their goalkeeper, then they can provide an alternative player before a game.",
      "IFAB have suggested that this initiative is recommended but not compulsory - albeit the Premier League have chosen to adopt it. The approach was trialled in UEFA competitions last term.",
      "The final rule revolves around penalties - specifically in a situation where a player has touched the ball twice when taking a spot kick. Should a player score a penalty and accidentally touch the ball twice then the referee would award a retake.",
      "But the kick has to be clearly unintentional for that rule to be valid. Should the player miss, then the defending team would be given an indirect free kick.",
      "Ex-Man City forward Julian Alvarez slipped as he took a penalty against Real Madrid last season - but due to the previous rule, it was not retaken. The new law has already been utilised at the Women’s Euros as Beth Mead slipped and touched the ball twice in the process of scoring. She was ordered to retake the penalty but saw her second effort saved by Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll.",

      "United boss Ruben Amorim has been trying to add more options to his midfield, after mainly focusing on bolstering his attack. Recent reports claimed the Red Devils were plotting a £61million move for Lopez, who won a gold medal with Spain at the Paris Olympics.",
      "United have wrapped up the signings of Matheus Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves, young defender Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £71m and, most recently, Benjamin Sesko for £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons.",
      "However, they are looking for more creativity and energy in midfield, which was a huge weakness for United last season. Unfortunately for them, Lopez will not be the new spark the Red Devils are looking for.",
      "He scored an impressive brace as Barcelona comfortably beat Como 5-0 in a pre-season friendly. Speaking to reporters after the match, he confirmed his future will still be with the Catalans.",
      "Lopez said: \"It was a great game from the whole team that will be good for us. The work is non-negotiable, the pressure is high too, like last year, when we did very well. Let’s continue like this.”",
      "He added: \"I want to stay here. It’s my dream and I will stay, I’m happy to help the team. Many things have been said.",
      "\"But I am going to continue defending these colours and working as hard as anyone else, so that the Catalans are calm.”",
      "Despite Lopez's comments, the Red Devils appear to be prioritising a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, who is a different profile of midfielder. The Seagulls ace has recently been linked with a huge move to Old Trafford, after impressing with his classy performances under Fabian Hurzeler.",
      "The Cameroonian, who was signed from Lille soon after Chelsea bought Moises Caicedo for a then Premier League record £115m, is understood to be valued by Brighton at around £100m. United's valuation is significantly less than the Seagulls', as they believe a fee of around £70m would be fair.",
      "However, with three years left on his deal at the Amex Stadium, Brighton are in a position to command whatever fee they want for the midfield engine. With the likes of Casemiro coming to the end of his career and Manuel Ugarte struggling for consistency since his move from Paris Saint-Germain last year, United's need for a midfielder is glaring to some.",
      "The Red Devils' new-look squad will face an immediate acid test, as they face Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their first five matches of the campaign.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been warned they need to move fast if they are to land Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. United are reportedly keen to sign Baleba in the summer transfer window, with Ruben Amorim chasing a holding midfielder for his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "United have reportedly made contact with Brighton to discuss the possibility of a transfer this summer. The Cameroon international has three years left on his Seagulls contract and is valued at £100million after a standout campaign.",
      "Amorim’s side have spent over £200m this summer to bring in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. They likely need to offload some of their unwanted players like Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho before moving for other targets.",
      "But Troy Deeney has warned them that Real Madrid could emerge as a rival for Baleba if they don’t move fast enough. Real are in the market for a central midfielder, and have been linked with Manchester City star Rodri, but Deeney thinks Baleba could fit the bill too.",
      "“I think United have to get Baleba this window, or they don’t get him,” Deeney said on talkSPORT. “If he has another good season, I do think other teams with Real Madrid and the like will come in and go ‘Bosh, we’ll have him’.",
      "“I think if Man United want him…if I’m Ruben Amorim I’m kind of bullish on that. I’d be saying ‘get this deal done because then I can get you into Europe’. If they can sign him, he can move them up 10 spaces [in the Premier League].”",
      "Brighton are no strangers to driving a hard bargain over their star players, having got good deals over Alexis Mac Allister, Marc Cucurella, Moises Caicedo and Joao Pedro in recent years. Speaking last week, chief executive Paul Barber played down the rumours around Baleba.",
      "\"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players,\" he said. \"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",
      "\"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players. Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him.",

      "If Manchester United are to get their hands on Carlos Baleba this month, Brighton won't be left entirely high and dry. In fact, Fabian Hurzeler's squad may already boast the replacements needed to fill any void following reports of fresh talks with the Red Devils.",
      "Having invested around £200million in a new front three, United have turned their attention to strengthening their midfield – and Brighton's box-to-box enforcer leads their wish-list. The Sun report United are persevering in new talks with Baleba's representatives despite Brighton insisting on a fee to rival the £115m Chelsea paid to sign Moises Caicedo two years ago.",
      "It's all part of the process that has made the Seagulls the envy of many teams in the transfer market in recent years – recruit prospects young, build them into first-team stars, sell for a hefty profit, and repeat.",
      "With United keen on Brighton's latest top talent, Baleba appeared to send a subtle message to the club's fans over the weekend too, by giving a timely like to Leny Yoro's post on Instagram. The pair are good pals, having played at Ligue 1 side Lille together before Baleba left to sign for Brighton, and it remains to be seen if they will yet be reunited at Old Trafford.",
      "Just as Baleba has thrived in the role that once made the likes of Caicedo and Yves Bissouma such a success at the Amex Stadium, he too has successors-in-waiting. And just like Baleba, it may not take more than a season or two to make it clear Brighton may have unearthed even more special talent, at least if their model's recent success is anything to go by.",
      "Despite having yet to truly break through in England, midfield prospects Diego Gomez and Malick Yalcouye are the ones to watch in Baleba's position at the base of midfield. Gomez in particular has already made an impression following his £11m move from Inter Miami this past January.",
      "\"When I saw him running - he was running during our training sessions – I saw a beast,\" Hurzeler said of the player when speaking in January. \"[It] is unbelievable how intense he can play football, and he proved it in the MLS.",
      "\"Of course, it is a different league, different profile. But in the end, it is exactly that what we want to have – physicality. We needed this physicality.\" The German tactician went on to say he was \"really happy\" with the Paraguayan's attitude and \"really looking forward to working with him.\"",
      "Gomez, 22, made 16 Premier League appearances during the second half of last season and scored his first goal for the club on the final day of the campaign. He also boasts 15 senior caps for Paraguay already, having made his full international debut at 19.",
      "Yalcouye, 19, is in a different stage of his development having only made his debut for the Ivory Coast's Under-23s side this summer.",
      "The teenager joined Brighton in July 2024 from Swedish outfit Goteborg for £7.6m – meaning Yalcouye and Gomez only cost Brighton a collective £18.6m – before an impressive loan spell with Austrian side Sturm Graz last season.",
      "Mali-born Yalcouye offers slightly different dimensions at around 5'7\", though he offers a versatile game of his own. Despite joining Brighton as a central midfielder, he spent the majority of his time in Austria out wide on either wing, scoring four goals and contributing two assists in 26 league games.",
      "And it's not as though Hurzeler's midfield alternatives are restricted to the pair of prospects. Mats Wieffer, Matt O'Riley, Yasin Ayari and Jack Hinshelwood are among those to have shared midfield minutes with Baleba last season, with each capable of fulfilling more defensive duties in that area.",
      "None of that may influence Brighton's toughened stance over selling Baleba, but the volume of alternative solutions may make the south-coast club more appeasable to a deal.",
      "Nothing changes from United's perspective, meanwhile, as affording such a move towards the end of an already expensive window becomes their main priority. Amorim knows United need to offload more players this month, with Chelsea currently in talks over winger Alejandro Garnacho.",

The latest step involves a potential behind-closed-doors friendly, organised with a view to ensuring a pair of stars get the game time they need.",
      "United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been absent from recent pre-season friendlies as he works his way back to full fitness. The rest of the first team have also yet to play alongside new striker Benjamin Sesko, whose arrival from RB Leipzig was made official over the weekend.",
      "According to The Times, the Red Devils are exploring the prospect of a friendly at the Carrington training complex this week. The opposition has yet to be decided, but Ruben Amorim's side would likely face local opposition.",
      "If Onana is unable to return to full fitness for the Arsenal game, Altay Bayindir could make just his fifth Premier League appearance in his third United season. The Turkish international also played against the Gunners in last season's FA Cup, saving a shoot-out penalty from Kai Havertz.",
      "Sesko, meanwhile, missed Leipzig's friendly against Atalanta on August 2 and didn't join his new club in time to face Fiorentina on Saturday. United won the weekend friendly, prevailing on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" United boss Amorim told club media. \"Ben is a player - with all the information that we have - that we need to stop the guy from working, not the opposite!",
      "\"So that is also important. He's really young. He's good in the air, he's good at running the channels, good on the ball. I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot and, for sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He has the right character to be in this group, so I'm really happy to have him.\"",
      "United's rivals Arsenal were also winners over the weekend. New striker Viktor Gyokeres scored his first goal for the club as they beat Athletic Club 3-0 to win the Emirates Cup.",
      "\"Well I think his goals, his threat, I think he pins both centre backs, he's a player that when you're living with a space, one against one, he's going to destroy you,\" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said when asked what Gyokeres brings to the team. \"So he's going to create a lot of space as well for us and yeah, the moment that in any situation there is a player there that can score a goal.\"",

      "Manchester United misfit Alejandro Garnacho has hinted that his Old Trafford nightmare could soon be coming to an end. The Argentine forward has next to no future with the Red Devils having been told to find a new club by Ruben Amorim at the end of last season.",
      "A number of clubs have already been linked with Garnacho ahead of next month’s transfer deadline. Italian giants Napoli emerged as potential suitors earlier this summer but their interest appears to have cooled.",
      "United’s Premier League rivals Chelsea have also made a move, having agreed personal terms with the young forward - albeit they still have to come to an agreement with the Red Devils. And Garnacho himself has now teased that a breakthrough might not be too far away.",
      "The 21-year-old shared a picture of himself sitting in a gym with his head in his hands. And the emojis of a sand timer and ellipses were particularly telling.",
      "United are expected to demand around £40m for Garnacho’s services given he has just under three years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. Speaking earlier this summer, boss Amorim made it clear that Garnacho was likely to move on.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” said Amorim. \"But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that.",
      "\"So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge. So we try to make everything OK for all parties. To the club, to the coach and to the player. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Garnacho is unlikely to be the only departure from Old Trafford before the end of the window. Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund are all expected to leave.",
      "AC Milan have opened talks with United regarding the Danish striker’s services following the signing of Benjamin Sesko. Real Betis were also keen to re-sign Antony following last season’s loan spell but have struggled to get a deal over the line so far.",

      "Manchester United are heading back into the top five of the Premier League this season, according to Luke Littler. United finished a miserable 15th in 2024/25 as Ruben Amorim endured a dreadful debut campaign, but Littler is convinced he will turn things around.",
      "The club are attempting to rebuild after a dreadful start to the Amorim era which concluded with their lowest league finish since the 1989/90 campaign and with a defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim managed to secure just seven wins from 27 league games and his hapless side scored just 44 goals in 38 Premier League matches altogether after he took over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "United have reacted by splashing over £200million to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in the summer transfer window. There have been some encouraging performances in pre-season and United fan Littler is feeling upbeat ahead of their first match of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "“I’m very excited. I think we are underdogs,” he said. “Obviously from last season, I don’t think anything worse can happen – unless we finish 16th. But yeah, I think it is going to be a very interesting season. Most clubs won’t expect it but I’m expecting top five.”",
      "United have only finished in the top five in the Premier League once in the past four years, having fallen way behind their rivals. The defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final means they will not play in any European competition this season and will be able to solely concentrate on domestic matters.",
      "Amorim has tried to completely change the way United play, and despite poor results so far, he remains confident it will work eventually. “I know it's a massive gap from where we finished, but it's Manchester United. We need to return to Europe,” he told BBC Sport recently.",
      "Asked if they could win the Premier League and Champions League once more, Amorim replied: “I have no doubts. There are some things you cannot buy that this club has: pedigree, history, fans. We have money without the Champions League. With all these things, if we have a different culture, we can return to our place.”",
      "United completed their pre-season with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina on the weekend and Amorim believes he now has more options to choose from. “That (a selection headache) is a good thing, it is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch,” he said.",
      "“This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "“It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Club World Cup this, transfer window that - it's nearly time for the good stuff again. The 2025-26 Premier League season kicks off next Friday, with Liverpool at home to Bournemouth serving as a curtain-raiser.",
      "The trophy is safely at Anfield after Arne Slot's side ran away with it last term, and now the challenge for the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City is to take it from them. Next is the battle for the Champions League, where Manchester United haven't been for two years.",
      "And what about the relegation scrap? We will see all three promoted teams go straight back down for the third year running?",
      "Here are our writers' 2025-26 Premier League predictions.",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City",
      "Relegated: West Ham, Burnley, Sunderland",
      "Surprise package: Tottenham",
      "Biggest disappointment: Erling Haaland",
      "Best new signing: Florian Wirtz",
      "Top goalscorer: Mo Salah",
      "Player of the year: Cole Palmer",
      "Young Player of the year: Ethan Nwaneri",
      "Andy Dunn: They won it in a ten-point canter last season and have done storming business in the transfer market so it really is hard to back against Liverpool retaining their Premier League title and against Mohamed Salah collecting another Golden Boot, especially when he will have the best signing of the window, Florian Wirtz, to help him out.",
      "You would expect Erling Haaland to rival Salah for the Golden Boot but the Manchester City striker might well find the going tough with a new-look side taking a good while to gel. City’s transitional period will mean Chelsea and Arsenal giving Liverpool the most to think about and with Cole Palmer pulling the strings, Enzo Maresca’s Club World Cup champions should show improved Premier League form.",
      "Arsenal have also had a good summer of recruitment and I expect more big things from their brilliant youngsters, Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri, but they will still come up just short.",
      "Unfortunately, it will be another struggle for the three promoted clubs but Leeds United should have enough to survive. In his short time there, Graham Potter has yet to convince at West Ham United and they could be mildly surprising candidates for the drop at the end of the 2025-26 season.",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "Relegated: Burnley, Brentford, Leeds",
      "Surprise package: Manchester United",
      "Biggest disappointment: Aston Villa",
      "Best new signing: Florian Wirtz",
      "Top goalscorer: Erling Haaland",
      "Player of the year: Florian Wirtz",
      "Young player of the year: Leny Yoro",
      "Chris McKenna: Liverpool to retain the English league title for the first time since the 1980s and overtake Manchester United with No 21. Why? Because they’ve spent big and spent well while their rivals are playing catch up.",
      "Florian Wirtz is a huge signing and I think he will have a starring role in their success to make him not only the best buy of the winner but a contender for player of the year. Manchester City will push them though as Pep Guardiola rebuilds his team but I expect them to find their peak again in the following campaign while Arsenal and Chelsea will fill up the rest of the top four.",
      "Who'll win the Premier League title? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Burnley and Leeds will struggle to stay up but I reckon Sunderland may surprise a few with their new faces. Brentford have lost their manager and best players, they could be in trouble. Manchester United a surprise package? Only because they won’t be as awful as they were last season and will push for a top six spot.",
      "Erling Haaland will find his shooting boots again and edge out Mo Salah in the race with the latter to miss some games due to AFCON. Leny Yoro looks a promising defender and could star for United this term.",
      "But I did predict Nottingham Forest would get relegated last season and they qualified for Europe - so I wouldn't bet on any of these!",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City",
      "Relegated: Leeds, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "Surprise package: Manchester United",
      "Biggest disappointment: Crystal Palace",
      "Best new signing: Joao Pedro",
      "Top goalscorer: Mo Salah",
      "Player of the year: Cole Palmer",
      "Young player of the year: Marc Guiu",
      "Neil McLeman: There are four genuine contenders in the most open title race for years. Champions Liverpool and runners-up Arsenal have spent massively but the Man City rebuild began in January while years of Chelsea spending saw them win the FIFA Club World Cup last month. The after effects of playing a major summer of one of many unknowns this season.",
      "Arne Slot was superb in his first Anfield season but faces an arguably an even more difficult task in this campaign of integrating big money signings as title favourites. Pressure will start to build quickly on Mikel Arteta if the Gunners are not competing for silverware.",
      "Without European football, Ruben Amorin will have the chance to stamp his identity on Manchester United and can achieve a top-six finish. But another summer of slow transfer activity at Selhurst Park threatens to make Crystal Palace’s first full European campaign a big challenge after their historic FA Cup success.",
      "Any promoted side staying up is now a minor miracle. Will Burnley’s more pragmatic defensive solidity be more successful in the top flight than Vincent Kompany’s more open approach back in 2023-24? Can Marc Guiu save Sunderland? And how long will Daniel Farke last at Leeds?",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea",
      "Relegated: Sunderland, Brentford, West Ham",
      "Surprise package: Noni Madueke",
      "Biggest disappointment: Brentford",
      "Best new signing: Florian Wirtz",
      "Top goalscorer: Erling Haaland",
      "Player of the year: Florian Wirtz",
      "Young player of the year: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "James Whaling: Liverpool won the league at a canter last term and it's hard to imagine they could have had a better transfer window. With the potential addition of Alexander Isak still to come, it's hard to back against the Reds going back-to-back.",
      "Arsenal also look stronger and I fancy they will be Liverpool's closest challengers, making it more of a race than last term. A change of scenery could be just the tonic for Noni Madueke as he bids to nail down a place in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Manchester City don't look quite ready to reclaim their crown, although I think Erling Haaland will return to the top of the goal charts, fitness permitting. Chelsea to complete the rest of the top four.",
      "At the other end, I think we will have more of a battle on our hands in the race to stay afloat. Leeds and Burnley look more well-equipped than promoted sides from the last couple of years to retain their top-flight status. A whole host of clubs could be in the mix, including Wolves and Everton, but I've plumped for Brentford and West Ham to join Sunderland in the drop zone.",
      "The Bees in particular have had a disappointing summer, losing boss Thomas Frank to Spurs and main marksman Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United. I think rookie manager Keith Andrews has a real job on his hands to maintain the club's upward trajectory.",
      "Florian Wirtz looks like being the Premier League's newest superstar and I think he will be right in the mix for Player of the Year come next May. Myles Lewis-Skelly is in a great position to continue his development and will be one of the favourites to scoop the Young Player award.",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal",
      "Relegated: Burnley, Sunderland, Leeds",
      "Surprise package: Jhon Arias",

      "Top goalscorer: Mo Salah",
      "Player of the Year: Mo Salah",
      "Young player of the Year: Ethan Nwaneri",
      "Ben Husband: Liverpool were head and shoulders the best team in the Premier League last season...and they may have got even better during the summer. I expect Manchester City to put up a much better challenge this time around, but I'm backing Arne Slot to do what Jurgen Klopp couldn't - and go back to back.",
      "And with that, I can’t look past Mo Salah winning another Golden Boot and being the best player in the division. Jeremie Frimpong will also slot in seamlessly at right back and perhaps offer what his predecessor Trent Alexander-Arnold didn’t.",
      "Arsenal will still be comfortably in the top four, but I don't anticipate them being as close when it comes to the title race. Their transfer business doesn't inspire me and I wouldn't be surprised if they fall off slightly.",
      "That being said, 25/26 promises to be a huge season for Ethan Nwaneri. He should become an even more important part of Mikel Arteta’s squad and will make it into Thomas Tuchel’s England World Cup squad.",
      "At the other end of the table, there's no doubt the three promoted sides will put up a better first of staying up than in previous years, but until I see otherwise, I still think the gap will prove too much - despite their spending.",
      "Wolves have lost plenty of talent during the window, but the acquisition of Jhon Arias should reap immediate benefits. He looked one of the better players at the Club World Cup and could hit the ground running.",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea",
      "Relegated: Burnley, Sunderland, West Ham",
      "Surprise package: Igor Thiago",

      "Top goalscorer: Erling Haaland",
      "Player of the year: Florian Wirtz",
      "Young player of the year: Archie Gray",
      "Tom Victor: This season’s Premier League campaign is a tough one to call, given the level to which all the big hitters have strengthened. Liverpool are unlikely to be as comfortable as they were last term, but I’m anticipating Manchester City and Chelsea’s Club World Cup exploits to leave them just behind the reigning champions and last season’s runners-up Arsenal.",
      "At the other end of the table, West Ham weren’t far above the drop zone last term and have lost Mohammed Kudus without a replacement coming in, leaving relegation as a real concern. Elsewhere, James Trafford’s Man City return is likely to damage Burnley and Sunderland will need a flurry of new signings to hit the ground running if they are to survive.",
      "Speaking of hitting the ground running, Liverpool’s record signing Florian Wirtz should be key to their success. I’m predicting the opposite on the other side of Merseyside, though - David Moyes had a horrible record with big-money signings at West Ham, and I fear the same could happen with Everton new boy Thierno Barry.",
      "Brentford need some players to step up after more high-profile exits, and I’m backing Igor Thiago to make up for his lost year, though I don’t see anyone catching Erling Haaland in the golden boot race now that his supply line has been bolstered.",
      "Finally, Spurs will surely improve on last season’s league showing, and Archie Gray - still just 19 - has a chance to enjoy a more settled second season under new boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea",
      "Relegated: Brentford, Leeds, Burnley",
      "Surprise package: Cody Gakpo",
      "Biggest disappointment: Hugo Ekitike",
      "Best new signing: Viktor Gyokeres",
      "Top goalscorer: Erling Haaland",
      "Player of the Year: Mo Salah",
      "Young Player of the Year: Rayan Cherki",
      "Daniel Orme: Liverpool were by far and away the best team in the league last season - and a lucrative summer has only made the champions even stronger. Given the new faces that they have welcomed to Anfield, it would be fair to say that they’ve once again got the strongest squad on paper which should be enough to see them win the league once again.",
      "That should also see Salah thrive and win the Player of the Year and while Gakpo is not an unknown quantity, I reckon he could hit even bigger heights and even be in the running for that gong too.",
      "But the same might not be said of summer arrival Hugo Ekitike. The Frenchman is far from a bad signing but he will need some adaptation and might not get as many goals as his lofty price tag suggests. Among their rivals, Erling Haaland and Rayan Cherki should sign, while Viktor Gyokeres will catch the eye for Arsenal.",
      "Meanwhile, two of the three promoted clubs will drop back into the Championship and might well be joined by Brentford, who have taken a massive risk by replacing Thomas Frank with Keith Andrews. The exit of Bryan Mbeumo and the potential departure of Yoanne Wissa haven’t helped.",
      "Champions: Liverpool",
      "Rest of the top four: Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "Relegated: Burnley, Brentford, Sunderland",
      "Surprise package: Leeds",
      "Biggest disappointment: Arsenal",
      "Best new signing: Florian Wirtz",
      "Top goalscorer: Alexander Isak",
      "Player of the year: Florian Wirtz",
      "Young player of the year: Ethan Nwaneri",
      "Oli Gamp: It would have been hard for me to go against Liverpool for the title even if they had made zero signings. After splurging £300m - and on some terrific new signings - they look dead certs to lift the Premier League crown once again.",
      "I feel in particular the £116m addition of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen will turn them into an even more lethal force. Mark my words, Wirtz will be known as 'The Locksmith' after this season because he's demonstrated how he can unlock even the tightest of defences and make things happen. In the last two seasons alone, he has 34 goals and 28 assists. He's quite simply a weapon and that's reflected in me backing him for best signing and POTY.",
      "Man City should push Liverpool close after strengthening too and while Arsenal have made good signings in this window, I feel they will come up short once again in what could be a crossroads moment for Mikel Arteta next summer. It seems like the right time for Alexander Isak to push on and show why he is one of Europe's best strikers right now and he could add to his 27 strikes from last season, especially if he joins Liverpool.",
      "I also feel Leeds will break the hoodoo of promoted teams going straight back down after some good additions that have gone under the radar and their existing quality, but time could be up for Brentford after losing Thomas Frank. And while I think Arsenal will have a disappointing season, I can see Ethan Nwaneri dazzling individually and showing why he is one of the brightest talents we have in this country.",

      "Alan Smith: The chasing pack will put up a bigger challenge than last season but Arne Slot's squad is stronger and could be boosted further. The only weakness appears a lack of depth at centre half, meaning an injury to Virgil van Dijk or Ibrahima Konate could derail them. Once they are available the Reds have to be favourites.",
      "Pep Guardiola's revamped midfield will see them climb to second above Arsenal while Chelsea will be fourth in a tightly-packaged group.",
      "It is becoming a familiar, concerning pattern but the promoted three appear likely to go straight back down. Their only chance of surviving is if an established club ends up in turmoil.",
      "West Ham need more additions in the transfer window, while the demands of European football could mean a regression at Nottingham Forest. Yet both should still be better than the new boys.",

      "Scott Trotter: Arsenal's pre-season hasn't been too convincing but it has to be their year at some point, right? Liverpool may have introduced too many changes, while Manchester City have some catching up to do after last season.",
      "Chelsea may have a tougher time than many expect too with greater competition to come in the Champions League and a big squad still to manage, though they may be best placed for fourth place unless Aston Villa make some smart moves. Florian Wirtz will light up the league once Liverpool settle but they could have too much to do if Viktor Gyokeres hits the ground running.",
      "Manchester United will not be as bad as last season, and could find some fluency with one game each week but still some way off competing with the best. A scenario that will leave nobody quite content after they had one eye on relegation last season.",
      "Brighton could push into the European spots as a period of stability sees them take advantage of those with busier schedules, while the teams promoted from the Championship will inevitably face a tough time. Vitor Pereira could spring a surprise with Wolves, along with Jorgen Strand Larsen, and despite their high-profile exits should enjoy a safe year.",

      "Sam Meade: City, after their year off, will come back with renewed motivation and I think that'll be enough to get them over the line. Liverpool still look electric, but if they do land Alexander Isak I start to wonder where all of the pieces of the jigsaw fit in. Newcastle, even if they lose their talisman, are incredibly well coached and could spring a surprise despite their poor summer.The feeling around West Ham isn't great, but Graham Potter showed time and time again that he was able to maximise his resources at Brighton. I've got big wraps on Cherki, who looked sensational for Lyon against Manchester United in Europe last year, and looks every inch a Pep Guardiola player.Nwaneri has come on every year and, with injuries to Arsenal's frontline last year, probably saw his development accelerated. His team-mate Myles Lewis-Skelly gets a lot of attention, and rightly so, but Nwaneri's ability to influence big moments in games is something to keep an eye on.",

      "Felix Keith: Liverpool have recruited brilliantly so far this summer and look – at paper at least – stronger than last year. I’m backing Mohamed Salah to shine again, partly because he was my only accurate prediction last season. Milos Kerkez was awesome for Bournemouth last season and is a major upgrade on Andy Robertson, who was shaky at times in 2024/25.",
      "This time last year I tried to be clever and looked beyond just predicting the promoted teams to go straight down and I won’t make that mistake again.",
      "Newcastle look a mess this summer and, if they lose Alexander Isak it will become even worse. Kevin Schade is going to step up and bang at Brentford after Bryan Mbeumo left.",

      "Top goalscorer: Erling Haaland",
      "Player of the year: Cole Palmer",
      "Young player of the year: Willian Estevao",
      "Dan Marsh: It's hard to look past Liverpool again, isn't it? They were lightyears ahead of the rest last year. And the fact they've added three top quality players with Alexander Isak still in their sights means it would take a very brave (or foolish) person not to back them for successive titles.",
      "Manchester City will recover from their 2024-25 malaise to challenge them, while I fancy Chelsea to stick around longer this year. Maybe I've got it all wrong, but I see them both finishing ahead of Arsenal, who will take the last Champions League spot.",
      "At the other end of the table, I think Burnley and Leeds will succumb to the current trend of newly promoted teams plummeting straight back down. I worry for Brentford, too: losing your star man (Bryan Mbeumo), captain (Christian Norgaard) and Thomas Frank in one summer is absolutely rotten luck. Keith Andrews might go on to be a fine head coach but he's got a daunting task ahead of him this season.",
      "I fancy Everton to emerge as the season's surprise package. David Moyes did a fine job after returning last season and I like the signings of Thierno Barry and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. On the other hand, I think Viktor Gyokeres will struggle to replicate the magnificent goalscoring feats that made him such hot property at Sporting Lisbon. I'm backing Florian Wirtz to establish himself as the summer's shrewdest acquisition, even with that £116million transfer fee.",
      "Erling Haaland will reign supreme in the battle for the golden boot (not exactly breaking news but y'know) while Cole Palmer will be the leading light for Chelsea, who I think are in store for a strong season. Willian Estevao, the exciting young attacker who shone at the Club World Cup, is my outsider pick for Young Player of the Year (everyone else had Lewis-Skelley or Nwaneri!).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There is less than a week until the return of the Premier League and Ruben Amorim will soon learn if his side have progressed over the summer. The Portuguese has a new frontline at his disposal after a deal for Benjamin Sesko was confirmed, to add to recent additions Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Sesko was paraded to fans in advance of the club's final friendly against Fiorentina at Old Trafford. United did not manage to put in a remarkable display but it signalled a landmark en route to the season beginning.",
      "But there is work still to be done. Rasmus Hojlund was in the squad for the game but did not feature amid speculation around his future, while the Red Devils will still hope to find clubs for Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "And while Old Trafford chiefs may hope to see funds replenished, there are areas of the team that still require improvement. Amorim surely would not say no to having a quality midfielder added to his ranks.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has admitted defeat and is prepared to consider an exit from Manchester United after the signing of Benjamin Sesko pushed him further down the pecking order. The Dane previously stated his intention to fight for his place and rejected the notion of a move to RB Leipzig but United have remained open to his departure.",
      "The striker is now more receptive to the idea of leaving Old Trafford after AC Milan came to the table, reports TalkSport. The Italians giants are in talks with United over a loan with opotion to buy with the Red Devils set for a significant loss after spending more than £70m two years ago.",
      "Jadon Sancho is said to be on Atletico Madrid's shortlist of targets for the final weeks of the transfer window. According to Fichajes, Diego Simeone wants to add to his squad out wide and the Manchester United flop is among those of interest.",
      "Sancho had appeared set to join Juventus but that move has seen little progress, while Borussia Dortmund have returned as a possible contender for his signature. The England international could yet find himself with options to consider with Simeone claimed to see Sancho 'as a potential game-changer on the flanks' with his direct style suiting a counter-attacking philosophy.",
      "Manchester United were in contact with agents of Brighton star Carlos Baleba over the weekend, per reports. United remain intent on advancing a deal via the player, as they did with Benjamin Sesko, before making an agreement with the Seagulls.",
      "Contract and salary remain under discussion, while contact remains with Brighton, though not advanced. Baleba is said to be interested in the move with United want to try and get a deal over the line, with personal terms not expected to be an issue.",
      "If their efforts do not pay off in the coming weeks, expect a return next summer.",

      "New Manchester United signing Benjamin Sesko may well be handed his preferred No.30 shirt at Old Trafford... all thanks to the largely unheralded new signing Diego Leon.",
      "United finally sealed their long-awaited move for the Slovenian international after beating Newcastle in the race for his signature after agreeing a £74m deal with RB Leipzig. He is the fourth signing of the summer for United, who have already sanctioned big-money buys on Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Bryan Mbeumo for around £71m. Young left-back Diego Leon has also arrived in a deal worth £7m.",
      "And thanks to the young left-back, Sesko may well be handed the No.30 shirt he wore during his time at Leipzig and which, by all accounts, he'd grown rather fond of.",
      "Fellow new signing Leon, 18, was initially handed the No.30 shirt during pre-season, wearing it when he featured for Ruben Amorim's side. But he has now switched to No 35.",
      "That decision clears the way for Sesko, who was introduced to fans on Saturday at Old Trafford - to take the No.30 ahead of his union up top with fellow new boys Bryan Mbeumo - who will be No.19 - and Matheus Cunha, who has inherited the No.10 shirt.",
      "When asked why he had chosen to sign for United despite competition from Newcastle, who are playing in the Champions League this season, Sesko said he was excited about the future of the club under manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" he said. \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",

      "Luis Enrique has already seen a new goalkeeper arrive in the French capital. PSG agreed a deal for Lille shotstopper Lucas Chevalier, who joins on a five-year contract after the Champions League winners decided to pay up £34.7m, with the potential for a further £13m in add-ons.",
      "The Parisian side are anticipating a bid for former AC Milan shotstopper Donnarumma as soon as this summer. It's understood they'll take a fee in the region of £26m - a knockdown price - for a player reckoned by some to be the world's best. And United are among those they see as a contender.",
      "The Red Devils have long been linked with signing a new goalkeeper. Back-up option Altay Bayindir has endured an uncertain future, with the club said to want greater competition for Andre Onana. Onana has not always asserted a confident presence at the Theatre of Dreams and has previously seen uncertainty over his own position, with figures such as Aston Villa star Emiliano Martinez and Donnarumma linked to Old Trafford.",
      "On Saturday, Amorim had the question put to him about the prospect of signing Donnarumma. The Portuguese was stopped outisde of the stadium, as Manchester United played their final friendly against Fiorentina, and was taken to task by a supporter of the club.",
      "Amorim could only first respond with \"Sorry?\" before the question was put to him a second time. The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss could only let out a wry laugh as he continued to sign autographs without offering a clear-cut answer.",
      "Perhaps not a question for him... Or perhaps not a priority with United's spending already exceeding £200million and a midfielder next on the agenda.",

Baleba, 21, is understood to be the man Amorim wants to shore things up in the centre of the park, having been left unconvinced by his current midfield options.",
      "It was reported on Wednesday evening that United intermediaries had contacted Brighton to discuss possible terms for the Cameroon international. Baleba, who has three years left on his contract, is seen as one of the most promising young talents in his position. He has impressively filled the void left by Moises Caicedo in Brighton's midfield over the past two seasons.",
      "United, however, face an uphill battle to sign the player, with Brighton keen to keep Baleba for at least another year and having reportedly set a price tag of over £100m.",
      "Yet, Baleba may have shown his preference towards a move by dropping a subtle hint to United, having liked Red Devils defender Yoro's recent Instagram post of the Frenchman representing United in pre-season. The two are close friends, having played together for Ligue 1 side Lille before Baleba moved to Brighton in 2023.",
      "Despite the excitement surrounding Baleba's potential arrival at Old Trafford, Brighton's chief executive Paul Barber earlier this week dismissed rumours that United have approached them to discuss Baleba's transfer.",
      "\"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players,\" he said. \"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",

If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players. Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him.",

      "The Red Devils have a new star striker in Sesko, whose £74million move from RB Leipzig was officially announced on Saturday. Such a recruitment already spelt danger for Hojlund, whose £72m transfer from Atalanta in 2023 simply hasn't borne rich enough fruit.",
      "But on the same day the 22-year-old Slovenian was introduced, Amorim's true colours were on show with his team selection for the pre-season clash against Fiorentina. Sesko was not eligible to feature, but that didn't stop the Portuguese coach from dropping Hojlund in favour of Mason Mount, who occupied a false-nine position, and making a telling pre-match admission.",
      "Before the match against Fiorentina, which ended in a 1-1 draw, Amorim was asked about Sesko, and told MUTV: \"He has the characteristics that we needed. Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "\"He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential,\" he continued.",
      "\"I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "Stating that Sesko will bring the 'characteristics that United need' implies that £72m man Hojlund does not hold such traits, and so even before the game began, the writing was on the wall for the Dane.",
      "Opting for Mount, who has primarily been used as a midfielder or rarely out wide under Amorim, in a false nine position just added to the hints that Hojlund is not part of the manager's plans now that a striker with a more suited character has arrived.",
      "Even before a deal for Sesko was completed, Hojlund had been linked with a move away from Old Trafford, despite declaring at the beginning of pre-season that he would stay and fight for his place regardless of who touches down to challenge him.",
      "Alas, talkSPORT reports that Hojlund has now come to terms with the idea that his days in Manchester are numbered, and he is now more receptive to leaving.",
      "AC Milan are one side who have shown interest, as well as Sesko's old employers, RB Leipzig, though United will not recoup the entirety of the fee paid for Hojlund just two seasons ago.",
      "It is thought that an asking price of around £40m would be enough to secure the 22-year-old's services, though £30m has also been mooted.",
      "With not only Sesko, but Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo recruited this summer to the tune of over £200m, Amorim's actions on Saturday seem to be the final nail in Hojlund's coffin.",

      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood was involved in an on-pitch brawl during Marseille's pre-season win over Aston Villa. The Ligue 1 side defeated Unai Emery's Villans 3-1 during their warm-up meeting on Saturday, though the fixture was anything but friendly.",
      "Greenwood put his side ahead just five minutes in before John McGinn equalised. Former Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then scored twice to secure a win for the French side, while Emery's men fell to a fifth pre-season defeat.",
      "Frustrations boiled over after Greenwood, having bounced off several feisty challenges in succession, cynically tripped Amadou Onana from behind after the Villa midfielder made a pass. Onana appeared to take exception to the challenge, and the pair began to square up to each other.",
      "Greenwood was seen laughing in the Belgian's face and seemingly blew a raspberry at Onana. That's when his Villa team-mate Tyrone Mings intervened, with the situation escalating as the defender grabbed Greenwood's jersey and dragged him back and forth.",
      "Players from both teams intervened and pulled the pair apart, with Greenwood's shirt being left ripped. However, despite their violent conduct, neither player was shown a red card.",
      "Greenwood, 23, took to Instagram after the match to share snapshots from the win but made no mention of the on-pitch altercation.",
      "One image showed him celebrating with his team-mates. He also reposted a clip of himself shrugging off Mings' challenge before tucking away the opening goal.",
      "Greenwood parted ways with the Red Devils last summer following a suspension by the club in January 2022 amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour. All charges were subsequently dropped, and the winger joined Getafe on loan on deadline day in the summer of 2023.",
      "His permanent transfer to Marseille in 2024 included a substantial sell-on clause in the deal, should Marseille decide to offload him in the future.",
      "Greenwood scored 21 Ligue 1 goals last season, and there were reports that he could be set for a move back to the Premier League. However, a transfer did not materialise, and Greenwood looks set to represent Marseille in the Champions League this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is prepared to admit defeat on his career at Manchester United and pursue the exit door after the signing of Benjamin Sesko pushed him further down the pecking order.",
      "Ruben Amorim has signed a number of new forwards, but it wasn't until Saturday that they confirmed the capture of a No 9. They spent more than £70million to land Sesko and that is set to hamper Hojlund's involvement going forward.",
      "He has previously rejected the potential of a move to RB Leipzig when the Manchester outfit were negotiating over a deal for Sesko. Now though the Dane is being more receptive to the idea of leaving Old Trafford with AC Milan coming to the table, reports TalkSport.",
      "The Italians are in talks with United over a potential move for the £40m-rated Hojlund. The Serie A outfit would ideally want a loan deal with a buy option at the end of the season as the Red Devils look to recoup some of the cash they paid to sign the striker only two years ago.",
      "If he does leave for the aforementioned fee it would still represent a loss of around £30m on the striker, who managed just four goals in the Premier League last term. That lack of potency is what motivated Amorim to go into the market.",
      "Only last week had Hojlund claimed, amid the talk of United pursuing a new striker, that he relished the prospect of competition and was determined to prove himself. “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether Joshua Zirkzee has a future in Manchester with Sesko now due to spearhead an attack that will also feature Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. All in all the Portuguese manager has spent more than £200m in his first summer.",
      "Amorim himself failed to rule out the possibility of Hojlund leaving in this window as he admitted: “The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed.\"",

      "Manchester United have sent a subtle message to Newcastle after beating them to the signing of Benjamin Sesko. United announced the signing of Sesko from RB Leipzig for a fee of £66.4m plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons on Saturday.",
      "He was unveiled at Old Trafford ahead of their final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina after signing a five-year contract. The 22-year-old is the third major addition to Ruben Amorim’s forward line after the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko was previously linked with Arsenal before it became a straight shoot-out between United and Newcastle. The Slovenia international made it clear that he preferred Old Trafford to St James’ Park, despite United’s lack of European football this season, and the move was wrapped up swiftly.",
      "His decision came as yet another blow to Newcastle, who have been continually thwarted in the transfer market this summer. While they have signed Anthony Elanga for £55m from Nottingham Forest, they have missed out on Sesko and Mbeumo to United, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Liam Delap and Joao Pedro to Chelsea, among others.",
      "United appeared keen to rub their noses in it on Saturday with a provocative post on X. “It was only ever United,” they wrote alongside two pictures of Sesko with director of football Jason Wilcox. The comments below were filled with memes poking fun at Newcastle, who could still lose Alexander Isak to Liverpool to round off a miserable summer.",
      "The Magpies will play in the Champions League this season after finishing fifth, yet still couldn’t persuade Sesko to join. He will lead the line for a side that finished 15th last season, yet made it clear why he made that call.",
      "“The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" he said. “When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Amorim told MUTV: “He has the characteristics that we needed. Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working – it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "“He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good at running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.”",

      "Keane's former team United went a goal up in the 82nd minute thanks to Alejandro Garnacho, but conceded just seven minutes later to Bernardo Silva, before going on to lose the first Manchester Derby of the season on penalties.",
      "Prior to the match at Wembley Stadium, Wright and Keane were pitchside preparing for their television roles when YouTube personality Harry Pinero and fellow content creator CultureCams appeared and approached the football legends.",
      "They greeted Ian Wright warmly, hugging the Arsenal legend and laughing as they enjoyed a nice chat. They then met Keane, who shook Pinero's hand initially, and then CultureCam's, in a relatively friendly manner.",
      "But the latter, immediately after introducing himself, attempted to show the Irishman the same affection he had shown Wright. Yet, that was a step too far for the intimidating and notoriously no-nonsense former midfielder.",
      "The ex-Red Devils captain was clearly caught off guard by the personal nature of the greeting. Keane didn't seem too impressed as CultureCams embraced him and awkwardly stood still without putting his own arm around the YouTuber, all while sporting a puzzled facial expression.",
      "His reaction left Wright and Pinero in heaps of laughter as the former England striker said: \"We all love him bro, but you can't come in like that.\" Keane, still stunned at the audacity, then gave a slight smile as the YouTuber corrected his error by offering him a simple handshake.",
      "Later, CultureCams didn't appear to regret his brazen move and seemed well aware that the Irishman was not a fan of hugs, writing on X: \"I did it for all of us.\"",
      "The clash marks Palace’s first appearance in the annual fixture, which has been a staple of the football calendar for nearly 120 years. Arne Slot's side, meanwhile, have lifted the shield 16 times. Both teams will look to begin their respective seasons on the right track ahead of next weekend’s Premier League 2025/26 season openers.",
      "Liverpool have bolstered their squad by spending around £265million on new signings in the summer transfer window, which could shoot up to £400m if they manage to secure Alexander Isak. Meanwhile, Palace have been disappointing in the transfer window while they await their European fate after appealing their demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League.",

      "There was a slightly surreal interaction on North State Street in Chicago during Manchester United's pre-season tour. While walking back from a CVS pharmacy one evening, it soon became apparent I was gaining on a few United players out for an evening stroll.",
      "Harry Maguire was the most conspicuous. Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw were in front of him. Suddenly, there was a whistle and someone left behind jogged past me to catch up with the group: Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Hojlund muttered something and then, awkwardly, Maguire started to slow down. He turned around.",
      "\"All right, mate.\"",
      "\"All right, mate.\"",
      "Possibly the three most oft-used words during interactions between British males. That was the sum of my 'night out' with United players.",
      "Reading between the lines, Hojlund had clocked me and made his teammates aware. Fernandes and Shaw did not even break stride. Maguire was perfectly polite.",
      "Hojlund was bound to recognise me as he once dedicated an Instagram post to me. Piqued by a story that some United players were reluctant to pass the ball to him, two days later he came on and scored the winner against Newcastle United and commemorated the moment on social media.",
      "On the pitch, Hojlund opted for a 'shhh' celebration, pressing his index finger against his lips. He did not silence the doubters last season. Hojlund scraped three goals in his final 35 appearances of 2024-25 and United are now brazenly pushing him out when they were once so protective.",
      "United were angry (on Hojlund's behalf) over the aforementioned story. Another member of their communications department has never celebrated more wildly in a press box than when Hojlund ended his goal drought at Leicester in March.",
      "Hojlund is not short of allies but he is now isolated. He started ball juggling during his warm up in the first half against Fiorentina on Saturday. That was a tell-tale sign he was never going to get on.",
      "In Chicago, Ruben Amorim refused to give assurances that Hojlund, who performed decently on tour, would stay. A few minutes later, Hojlund strolled into the mixed zone and asked if anyone wanted to talk to him. It was not lighthearted.",
      "One club cannot house two £70m-odd strikers. Benjamin Sesko's fee is marginally more than Hojlund's two years ago. Both are overpriced but Sesko's value feels fairer, given his development and reputation. He has been on United's radar for at least three years, too.",
      "Hojlund is an easy fall guy for the Ineos cabal. He was signed by the previous regime, Sir Jim Ratcliffe included him among the players that he had \"inherited\" and Hojlund's record is indefensible: 26 goals in 95 appearances.",
      "Admittedly, he started both seasons recovering from an injury. After he returned from a hamstring tear in September, Hojlund did not sustain another injury. Hojlund started 38 fixtures and his longest run on the bench was two games in 2024-25.",
      "He was never good enough to lead the line for United and was always destined to fail. The final fee of £64m up front rising to £72m contradicted United's brief that they would not break £60m for their new centre forward.",
      "Switching to the same agency that represented the manager heaped more pressure onto Hojlund. Erik ten Hag would have preferred Harry Kane but Ten Hag told confidants Hojlund had a \"proven goalscoring profile\". He didn't.",
      "Then there was the support striker, Anthony Martial. If you literally leant on Martial for support, he would break something. The Frenchman was as durable as a collection of bamboo sticks and did not play once for United in his final five months at the club.",
      "There were glimpses that Hojlund could be a long-term frontman. He unnerved William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes on his debut at Arsenal, plundered five goals in four Champions League starts and was the Premier League Player of the Month in February 2024 with five goals in four games. Hojlund was so pivotal that his muscular injury at the end of that month preceded United's home defeat to Fulham which ended their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "United recorded a minus goal difference in the past two seasons. They had to bring in a new No.9. So Hojlund had to make way.",
      "The noises from the hierarchy were unkind. One high-profile figure questioned Hojlund's work rate. The hesitancy to play the ball to Hojlund was never more public than when Diogo Dalot decided against crossing to him against Real Sociedad.",
      "Marcus Rashford's cousin derided Hojlund's pressing and how often he lost challenges. Another senior teammate shook his head at United's striker options and sighed, \"F*****g hell.\"",
      "The direction of travel has been that Hojlund would end up travelling elsewhere. Yet, if or when he does, United do not have a senior striker to provide back up for Sesko.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, scorer of seven goals in 49 games, is not a No.9 and not an outright No.10. Football's pseudo-intellectuals might dub him a 'nine-and-a-half'. Ie. neither here nor there.",
      "Zirkzee has been injured for practically four months. He has not had a kick in pre-season and was rushed back from a hamstring injury for the Europa League final. That told everyone what Amorim thought of Hojlund.",
      "United have a lighter work load this season and require a lighter squad. Chido Obi decamped to the first team in February but is only 17 and does not have a locker in the new Carrington dressing room yet. Instead, he is in the \"halfway house\" changing area reserved for emerging talent.",
      "Amorim trialled Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo through the middle in United's last two friendlies. He has auxiliary options.",
      "However much longer Hojlund remains at United, he is likely to be left behind.",

      "The new season is upon Manchester United and they have three new forwards to pit against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's arrival eight days before United's opening Premier League fixture is well timed. United head coach Ruben Amorim trialled Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo up front in United's friendly draws with Fiorentina and Everton.",
      "Sesko arrived in Manchester on Thursday and he has already dined at Spinningfields and San Carlo as he settles into his new home. More importantly, he will have had a full week to familiarise himself with his new teammates at Carrington.",
      "Here are some talking points from Sesko's first training session at United:",
      "United uploaded pictures from their post-Fiorentina training session on Monday but they are dated Sunday August 10. So the session took place the day after the 1-1 draw.",
      "The day after a match is a recovery day for starters. Bruno Fernandes was captured by club photographers but he looks more like a ball-boy than a participant.",
      "Every substitute who came on against Fiorentina (Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot) is accounted for. So are unused substitutes Tom Heaton, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson, Toby Collyer, Diego Leon and Dermot Mee.",
      "The only substitute not visible in the imagery is Rasmus Hojlund. That seems somewhat significant amid United's efforts to offload him to AC Milan.",
      "Sesko will have had a full week of training to prepare for the Arsenal match. United players are bullish about the new season partly due to the ample recovery time they will have between matches in the absence of any European football but August is always a sparse month.",
      "The 22-year-old Sesko played 45 minutes for RB Leipzig during their pre-season schedule and that was on July 19, so he is short of minutes. Amorim has ensured the majority of United's core squad members have had sufficient playing time over their five friendlies (Fernandes and Amad were the only two to start all five friendlies) and United looked fitter than they had done in pre-season for several years.",
      "Yet with Hojlund out in the cold, Joshua Zirkzee only just back from injury and no other senior striker, Sesko has to start. A full week at Carrington should stand him in good stead.",
      "Defender Noussair Mazraoui remains an injury concern ahead of United's Premier League opener.",
      "The Morocco international missed United's final four games of pre-season after featuring in the first half of their opening friendly of the summer against Leeds United just over three weeks ago.",
      "Despite travelling to the United States for the club's pre-season tour, he played no part in any of their Premier League Summer Series fixtures and was last pictured training two days before the tour opener against West Ham United in New Jersey.",
      "Since the United squad returned to England early last week, the club has not uploaded any training images or footage of the defender, meaning he could miss out on Sunday.",
      "With plenty of first-team players not taking part in the session, United boosted the numbers by including some academy players. Among those pictured were Jaydan Kamason, Fredricson, Rhys Bennett, Jacob Devaney, Sekou Kone, James Scanlon, Ethan Ennis, Ethan Williams and Bendito Mantato.",
      "Fredricson was the only player from the aforementioned list to be included in the matchday squad against Fiorentina, but he failed to make it off the bench.",
      "Alongside Fredricson, Kone, Williams and Mantato were named in the United squad for their tour of the US.",

      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in the 1-1 draw - the first time he did not appear in any of United's five pre-season matches. Head coach Ruben Amorim elected to start playmaker Mason Mount up front, having played Matheus Cunha there in the 2-2 draw with Everton six days earlier.",
      "The MEN revealed last week sources close to Hojlund felt he would have to leave if Sesko came in. Hojlund is unhappy at United seemingly forcing him out and stressed only 12 days ago that he wanted to remain at the club. Amorim refused to give public assurances that Hojlund would stay.",
      "International players are under more pressure to ensure they have regular playing time this season ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Hojlund has scored one goal in his past 16 appearances for Denmark and was dropped to the bench for their last qualifier against Lithuania.",

      "Sesko completed a £73.62million transfer to United from RB Leipzig on Saturday and could make his debut in their opening Premier League fixture of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "When asked by club media which former United strikers he most admired, Sesko mentioned Ibrahimovic, who spent just under two seasons at the club under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ibrahimovic scored 28 goals in his first campaign with United as they won the League Cup and the Europa League to return to the Champions League, a competition Sesko played in with Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig.",
      "\"Since I've been small I've been watching him, every single YouTube video I can find, because he is amazing for me,\" Sesko told club media. \"We don't have the same, let's say, character but I like to see the way he plays, the way he enjoys football. If you enjoy football then everything works.",
      "\"It's just basically been my dream to one day meet him, that would be great. In general, he's my idol. (I've been) trying to take some stuff from him, especially some similarities with high kicks and power strikes.",
      "\"We are not the same, we have different playing styles but if there is any situation I try to do like he did.\"",
      "Sesko also expressed his admiration for Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, members of the last title-winning squad at United in 2013. Van Persie spent three years at the club while Rooney became United's record goalscorer before ending his 13-year spell in Manchester in 2017.",
      "\"For me, it's Van Persie, Rooney, all those kinds of guys,\" Sesko added of the former United forwards he admires. \"I've been watching them on videos. They've been great. I can admire them a lot and show myself in a good light here and try to help the team, help the club to be as high as possible.\"",
      "Sesko trained with his new teammates for the first time on Monday, having arrived in Manchester on Thursday.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, August 11.",
      "The Reds have played their final pre-season fixture of the summer this weekend, drawing 1-1 with Fiorentina at Old Trafford before winning a penalty shootout. Now, all the attention turns to the new Premier League campaign and the visit of Arsenal a week today.",
      "One man who could be involved is Benjamin Sesko after he was unveiled to the United fans at Old Trafford on Saturday prior to the clash with the Italian giants. His arrival has led to more question marks surrounding Rasmus Hojlund who did not feature against Fiorentina.",
      "Elsewhere, Gianluigi Donnarumma continues to be linked with United while his situation with PSG remains unclear. Meanwhile, Brighton's Carlos Baleba is believed to be an option to add further bite to the midfield.",
      "Amidst all of this, Alejandro Garnacho continues to be focussing on a move to Chelsea and uncertainty remains over the futures of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Take a look at all the latest United transfer news throughout the day, below...",
      "Manchester United know they're a midfielder away from having a hugely competitive starting XI after addressing some key flaws in their squad. The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have given Ruben Amorim a completely new-look starting front three.",
      "They'll need time to bed into their new surroundings at Old Trafford, but the general consensus is they're ready-made signings who can have an instant impact. United will want to avoid a repeat of last season's dismal campaign and the signing of a defensive midfielder could play a major part in that.",
      "Given there'll be no European football for United this season, they can focus on the Premier League and winning some domestic silverware. Recent transfer speculation linking the club with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba are exciting links.",
      "The club is crying out for a holding midfielder who can protect the back three and stop the XI being so vulnerable in transition. However, given Brighton have slapped a reported £100million asking price on the Cameroonian's head, the club know they need to offload a number of fringe players before investing that kind of money.",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Marcus Rashford faces a race against time to be registered for Barcelona's La Liga opener against Mallorca this weekend. The La Liga club are working to register new players for said game, but the Manchester United loanee is a doubt to feature given the club's ongoing financial struggles.",
      "Barca president Joan Laporta told TV3: \"We're working to make it happen. With Marc's decision, we have the option of registering Joan Garcia, and we're working on the rest. This week we'll have news, hopefully good news, to see if we can register them before La Liga starts. And if we can't, we have time.”",
      "Football Insider claims Manchester United are still keeping an eye on Harry Kane's future at Bayern Munich this summer.",
      "Pete O'Rourke said:",
      "Obviously if a player like Harry Kane is willing to come back to the Premier League, there will be clubs very much interested. The big question is which English club will be looking to bring him back to the Premier League?",
      "“Obviously, he’s the second-highest goalscorer in the Premier League behind Alan Shearer, so that might be in his mind to come back and break that record. He’s got a release clause which decreases the closer it gets to the end of his Bayern Munich contract.",
      "“So he could be available from January for around £56million, which would be a bargain for somebody like Harry Kane. The only negative is his age, he’s 32 now and will be 33 next season, will any of the elite clubs be willing to go out and sign him?",
      "“If Harry Kane does become available next summer, there’ll be clubs that will be interested because he is guaranteed goals. Man United have consistently been linked with him, even in the last couple of seasons of his time at Tottenham before he moved to Bayern Munich.",
      "“I’m sure that interest is still there because he has been a long-term target for them. Any move is a way away, there will be more talk about this from January onwards into next summer, but for now his focus is on Bayern Munich.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko hopes to emulate his \"idol\" Zlatan Ibrahimovic and lead Manchester United to success this season.",
      "Sesko completed a £73.62million transfer to United from RB Leipzig on Saturday and could make his debut in their opening Premier League fixture of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "\"Since I've been small I've been watching him, every single YouTube video I can find, because he is amazing for me,\" Sesko told club media. \"We don't have the same, let's say, character but I like to see the way he plays, the way he enjoys football.

      "\"We are not the same, we have different playing styles but if there is any situation I try to do like he did.\"",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Reported Manchester United transfer target Fermin Lopez has made the decision to remain at Barcelona and reject interest elsewhere.",
      "\"Barcelona fans should rest, because I will stay here... I will not leave Barca,\" he told reporters on Sunday, after Barcelona beat Como 5-0.",
      "\"It was a game about building confidence ready for the start of La Liga. The important thing is the team did a very good job.\"",
      "Former Manchester United star Eric Djemba-Djemba has urged Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking to Footy Africa, Djemba-Djemba said: \"Baleba is currently among the top defensive and box-to-box midfielders in the Premier League, and joining Manchester United wouldn’t surprise me at all.",
      "\"It would be a masterstroke of a deal for both the player and Manchester United. He's a massive passer and a shield to the backline, but also great going upfront, which is what Ruben Amorim desires. Baleba would also improve his game working in a project under a whole new rebuild.",
      "\"For me, that would only spell good news for Cameroon to be honest. The only negative about this deal is that Brighton would be losing a massive asset. He's such a beast, yet he also has the ability to pass at range and shoot.\"",
      "Chelsea are set to battle with Manchester United for Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer, according to to RMC Sport.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side are in the market for a new No.1 and have expressed an interest in signing the Italy international before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "While both Chelsea and United have enquired about his situation, they haven't made formal contact with his entourage.",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is open to joining AC Milan.",
      "United are confident a deal can be struck with Milan, who are rebuilding their squad following the return of coach Massimiliano Allegri. Milan finished eighth last season and failed to qualify for Europe.",
      "It remains unclear whether a permanent deal could materialise as United value Hojlund at around £30million and Milan are seeking a loan move for the 22-year-old.",
      "Hojlund is only two years into a five-year deal at United but the club decided early this calendar year to cash in if they recruited a new centre forward.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United will need to make a \"crazy\" offer to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton this summer, according to journalist Fabrizio Romano. The 21-year-old has emerged as Ruben Amorim's top target to strengthen United's midfield.",
      "Romano told GIVEMESPORT: \"It means an important, very important, maybe crazy proposal is needed or Baleba is not available for sale this summer. It's never easy to negotiate with Brighton, especially with 23 days to go. But Manchester United wanted to try. Let's see what happens next.\"",
      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of young goalkeeper Charlie Hardy from Derby County, according to CentreDevils.",
      "The report states that Hardy \"wasn't included in Derby County's scholarship list of 2025, with a move to the Reds getting closer now.\"",
      "The 15-year-old appeared for Derby's Under 18s four times last season and captained the side once against Leeds United.",
      "According to StrettyNews, Manchester United have lined up a new meeting with Gianluigi Donnarumma's agent, Enzo Raiola this week. Confidence is growing at Old Trafford that Donnarumma, 26, is going to become their new first-choice goalkeeper in a summer move from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Talks for Donnarumma are led by Jason Wilcox, who wants to provide Amorim with a trusted pair of hands in goal, as Andre Onana has flattered to deceive since his move from Inter Milan.",
      "Roma are preparing a move for Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho, according to reports in Italy. The 25-year-old informed the Reds of his desire to explore different opportunities earlier this summer and it's claimed that the Serie A club want to bring him to Stadio Olimpico.",
      "Roma head coach Gian Piero Gasperini is said to be a huge fan of Sancho and is hoping to sign him, despite the fact he could take up a considerable amount of their transfer budget.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has accepted that his Manchester United career is all-but over following the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig on Saturday, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Serie A side AC Milan are open to signing Hojlund, who impressed in Italy with Atalanta before his move to United in August 2023. The Dane was said to have rejected a move to RB Leipzig earlier in the summer but his stance has now changed and he has agreed to leave.",
      "United want around £30m for Hojlund but Milan are hoping to secure his signature on an initial loan deal.",
      "According to Marca, Manchester United are expected to submit an offer for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. Ruben Amorim's side are set to shift their attention to strengthening in midfield after signing Benjamin Sesko and Baleba has been identified as a top target.",
      "However, there is a stumbling block that United face. Brighton are an excellent selling club and do not intend to sell a player on the cheap, as seen with Moises Caicedo's £115million move to Chelsea.",
      "According to TBR Football, Manchester United are preparing to loan out Andre Onana and then attempt to sign Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "\"We are told that Man United would consider allowing Onana to leave on a loan deal should they find a new number one between the sticks,\" the source said.",
      "\"Manchester United are open to making changes in their goalkeeping department and Onana is aware. There is a chance to bring in a Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martinez, one of the best keepers in the world, and United are tempted.",
      "\"However, understandably there is a lot of interest in Donnarumma – him being available is something more than just United think is a great opportunity.\"",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin has ditched his representative and will conduct his own transfer talks from now on as he tries to find a new club, according to The Sun.",
      "It's claimed that Calvert-Lewin, who left Everton when his contract expired earlier this summer, is keen to sign for Manchester United. The England international has his sights set on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Sunderland and Aston Villa are among the others that remain interested in Calvert-Lewin, who found the net just three times in the Premier League last season.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer news blog on this fine Monday morning.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest throughout the day from Old Trafford...",
      "The major stumbling block when it comes to Manchester United signing Carlos Baleba appears to be Brighton's financial demands.",
      "Having sold Moises Caicedo for over £100million to Chelsea, it seems like that a similar fee would be demanded for the Cameroon international.",
      "With United having spent big already this summer, some cheaper alternatives will almost certainly be considered. Atalanta star Ederson is one of those with interest from Old Trafford already present in the Brazilian.",
      "Lucien Agoume of Sevilla and Valenci's Javi Guerra are two other cheaper options with the latter linked to United earlier in the window.",
      "Manchester United could complete their summer transfer business with the sensational signing of Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba - but convincing the south coast club won't be easy.",
      "The 21-year-old has emerged as a potential reinforcement for Ruben Amorim's midfield, helping to ease the defensive burden on Bruno Fernandes. Baleba's arrival would also enable Fernandes to get on the ball more and dictate play from the midfield base - an area where the Portugal international is expected to excel.",
      "United have so far welcomed Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to Old Trafford this summer. Could Baleba be the fifth signing?",
      "Click here to read the latest on his future on the south coast....",
      "Though it looks unlikely that Manchester United will sign Gianluigi Donnarumma, his Paris Saint-Germain future is uncertain.",
      "If one of Altay Bayindir or Andre Onana depart, the Italy international could be looked at but the first priority appears to be signing a midfielder.",
      "AC Milan's plans to sign a new striker, amid links to Rasmus Hojlund, may soon be outweighed by a need to strengthen at centre-back.",
      "That is because Malick Thiaw is on his way to Newcastle while Andrei Coubis may no longer be trusted by Massimiliano Allegri having scored an own goal and been sent after just 19 minutes of their pre-season friendly against Chelsea.",
      "FotMob has Rafael Leao playing in a false nine role and with the Portugal international far better off the left, it showcases exactly why the Italian giants want Hojlund.",
      "For United, moving for Fermin Lopez now is, and always has been, considered an unrealistic target.",
      "Everything from the finances, to the player's thoughts and United's summer activity shows that the 22-year-old would not be a likely candidate for the Reds.",
      "But, with Chelsea thought to have been interested in the Barca man, this could prove to be good news in United's attempt to sell Garnacho.",
      "Speaking to football betting site BetVictor, Chelsea favourite Pat Nevin expressed doubt regarding the suitability of Garnacho at Stamford Bridge.",
      "I don't see Alejandro Garnacho as a great fit at Chelsea. Chelsea might do it to make money, but is he going to come and light up Chelsea more than Pedro Neto, whose professional attitude, his work rate he's given for the team has been absolutely fantastic? There's a whole bunch of other players in that position. Jamie Gittens has come in, Chelsea also have Estevao from Brazil with a lot of expectation, how many players do you need there? £40m isn't to be sniffed at, you don't make that much more than that for getting into the Champions League and having a good run. Do you want to spend that on Garnacho who may or may not do okay? Also, if it doesn't work at Chelsea and it kind of worked averagely at best at Manchester United, there's no big profit there. So it would surprise me, but I am often surprised by Chelsea.",
      "According to Sport, both United and Chelsea have shown ambitions to sign Fermin Lopez in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is claimed that both clubs can activate his £60.6m release clause this summer should they wish to.",
      "However, the 22-year-old is thought to hold no desire in leaving Barcelona this summer having scored six goals in 28 La Liga appearances last term.",
      "This season, of course, the attacking midfielder will be playing alongside Rashford who joined the club on loan in the summer.",
      "On the surface, it seems like United probably don't need Calvert-Lewin this summer.",
      "Sesko has just signed and he will lead the line for the Reds this season so why sign Calvert-Lewin?",
      "Well, that all depends on the future of Hojlund.",
      "If he is loaned or sold to AC Milan, United could need a player to play back-up to Sesko and Calvert-Lewin could be a low cost option that Amorim may give the green light to.",
      "According to The Sun, former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is taking matters into his own hands to try and sign for United this summer.",
      "It is believed the 28-year-old has sacked his agent and will be trying to push through a dream move to Old Trafford before the window closes.",
      "Of course, as a free agent, Calvert-Lewin can join United at any time during the season and is not confined to moving solely in the summer transfer window.",
      "Speaking to Rousing the Kop, journalist Graeme Bailey has insisted that Liverpool currently have no plans to pursue Carlos Baleba.",
      "It is believed to be true that they are great admirers of the Cameroonian but that is thought to be the case of every major European club.",
      "While they have also been credited previously with trying to sign Baleba, even before he moved to Brighton, Slot is thought to be happy with Gravenberch in that position and has no plans to replace him.",
      "MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Hojlund would be open to leaving United before the end of the transfer window if he felt that there was no chance of him playing regularly this season.",
      "Now, talkSPORT have corroborated that stance suggesting that Hojlund has reluctantly agreed to leave Old Trafford.",
      "They add that RB Leipzig discussed a separate deal for Hojlund after Sesko left but the Dane was not keen on the move.",
      "Now that United have brought in Sesko, attention turns to United's next priority.",
      "We are one week away from the new Premier League campaign so let us know your thoughts on the transfer window in our poll below.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United have maintained contact with Baleba's agents regarding a potential deal.",
      "United reportedly see Baleba as their perfect midfield signing this summer and are in constant talks about his wages.",
      "However, Brighton insist that Baleba is not for sale and will reportedly make life difficult for United.",
      "The Reds are willing to try and bring him in though."

      "Two of Marcus Rashford's Barcelona teammates have shown their support to the Manchester United loanee after he made his unofficial home debut on Sunday. Playing at the Estadi Johan Cruyff, home of Barca's infamous La Masia academy, Hansi Flick's side thrashed Como 5-0 in their final pre-season fixture.",
      "With Robert Lewandowski still out with a muscle problem, Rashford started through the middle with 18-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal on the right and Raphinha on the other side. It was a front three that caused Cesc Fabregas' Como issues from the get-go, with Rashford's pace a particular threat.",
      "Fermin Lopez bagged a quick-fire brace to put Barca 2-0 ahead, before Rashford turned on the afterburners to set-up his side's third. The United forward ran from inside his first own half and burst past the Como back-line, before showing composure to feed the ball across the box for Raphinha to tap home.",
      "Yamal then put Barcelona 4-0 up before Rashford missed a guilt-edge chance to score a fifth. He went through on goal and took the ball around the goalkeeper but somehow, despite having an open net, put the ball wide in what was described in some quarters on social media as an early 'miss of the season' contender. Yamal added his second for Barca in the second half to complete a five-goal rout.",
      "After the game, Rashford took to Instagram to react to his team's performance. He said: \"Good performance, good win,\" alongside a collision emoji and flexed bicep emoji. \"Ready for what's coming,\" with raised hands emoji.",
      "Former Manchester City forward Ferran Torres and Spain international Lopez were among his Barcelona teammates to react to Rashford's post. Indeed, both players left a supportive message in the comments section.",
      "Torres posted two fire emojis, while Lopez put three clapping hands emojis. Despite Rashford's miss the Barca players seem to be right behind him and are backing him to impress for them this season.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on a season-long loan in July, after he spent the second half of last season at Villa. He netted four times and added six assists in 17 matches for Unai Emery's side.",
      "Barcelona have faced difficulties registering players with La Liga due to their ongoing financial situation. Barca struggled to register Dani Olmo and Pau Victor last season, with the duo given short-term licences which were cancelled during the January transfer window. Following an appeal, the club were granted permission to have their licenses reinstated but it remained a consistent issue throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "Barca president Joan Laporta is confident that Rashford is going to be registered, along with five other stars, for the start of the new campaign. \"It's progressing well,\" Laporta told ESPN.",
      "\"We're doing our job and we're confident that we'll be able to register everyone.\"",
      "When asked about the situation, Rashford added: \"It's something for the club to sort out. I believe they are going to get it sorted. I just focus on training and be ready for the start of the season.\"",

      "The expectation is that any new signing will be in the midfield and United have been heavily linked with a move for Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old is an international teammate of United stars Mbeumo and Andre Onana and has impressed at Premier League level for the Seagulls across the last couple of seasons.",
      "But Brighton are known to be tough negotiators and will not sell unless the price is deemed right for them, even if they have been known to sell some of their top talents to bigger clubs in England.",
      "Albion have sold the likes of Joao Pedro, Ben White, Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister and Marc Cucurella for huge fees in recent seasons and Baleba could be the next name on that list.",

      "However, one of those options can be scratched off that list. Valencia midfielder Javi Guerra had been linked with a move to United but he has ended speculation over his future by signing a new deal with the Spanish side.",
      "The Spain under-21 international has penned a contract until 2029 at the Mestalla and in a statement, Valencia said it underlined their 'firm commitment to his development, as well as the player's desire to continue growing alongside the club'.",
      "However, the 22-year-old's new deal is said to include a release clause of around £87million and while he won't be moving to Old Trafford this summer, United will surely continue to monitor his progress in Spain.",

      "Expected to make his debut for United when they face Arsenal in their Premier League opener on Sunday, Sesko has outlined what sort of qualities he will add to Amorim's team, pinpointing his desire to attack spaces in forward areas.",
      "Sesko told club media: \"I'm kind of the guy that is ready to attack, to be in front, if there is a space to run in.",
      "\"Of course, if there are crosses, it's always going to be nice, I'm always going to be there and I think that's also what is important.\"",
      "The Slovenia international, 22, is expected to be at the centre of United's new-look front-three alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. The trio scored 58 goals for their former clubs across all competitions last season.",
      "Looking forward to working with Amorim, Sesko added: \"Of course, I think this is a really important part in football. [He is a] great guy, a great coach.",
      "\"So when you're going to start, it's important.\"",

      "Manchester United now officially have less than a week to go before their Premier League campaign gets underway.",
      "United host Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday in their first competitive match of the new season. Ruben Amorim and Co. go into the new campaign on the back of an impressive pre-season trip to the United States and a penalty shootout win over Fiorentina at the weekend.",
      "It's also been a busy summer on the transfer front for United, with three new signings being confirmed already. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all joined - as well as Diego Leon after a deal was struck in January - and there is the possibility that more will happen before the deadline.",
      "United have also sanctioned some departures this summer, with Marcus Rashford leaving to join Barcelona on loan. More players could leave Old Trafford before the September 1 deadline, with the potential for some deals to be completed before the clash against Arsenal arrives on Sunday.",
      "In terms of new signings, the one player who is being linked with a move to United the most is Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder has emerged as a target for United this summer, but it remains to be seen if a deal will be agreed with the Seagulls.",
      "There have been reports that Brighton would demand around £100million, or more, to allow Baleba to leave the club this summer. While unlikely, there is still the possibility that a deal could be done over the next week if United wish to do so.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho could also leave United this week amid reported interest from Chelsea. There could also be resolutions to Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia's futures after the trio informed United of their desire to leave the club earlier in the summer.",

      "Manchester United know they're a midfielder away from having a hugely competitive starting XI after addressing some key flaws in their squad. The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have given Ruben Amorim a completely new-look starting front three.",
      "They'll need time to bed into their new surroundings at Old Trafford, but the general consensus is they're ready-made signings who can have an instant impact. United will want to avoid a repeat of last season's dismal campaign and the signing of a defensive midfielder could play a major part in that.",
      "Given there'll be no European football for United this season, they can focus on the Premier League and winning some domestic silverware. Recent transfer speculation linking the club with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba are exciting links.",
      "The club is crying out for a holding midfielder who can protect the back three and stop the XI being so vulnerable in transition. However, given Brighton have slapped a reported £100million asking price on the Cameroonian's head, the club know they need to offload a number of fringe players before investing that kind of money.",
      "United's transfer spend already exceeds £200million and spending that much on one player would be a huge commitment. Which is why Adam Wharton would be a brilliant alternative signing.",
      "Of course, Palace themselves would want a huge transfer fee, previously valued at around £60million. It's fair to say that his value is only going to increase after shining in the FA Cup-winning run last season and more recently in the Community Shield triumph over Liverpool.",
      "CIES Football Observatory, who use a sample of more than 8,000 past transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression - with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable, believe the former Blackburn Rovers player should be valued more in the region of €32million (£27.7m) to €37m (£32m).",
      "Even if United have to pay in excess of £60million, that should be considered a bargain for one of Europe's top midfielders and a rising star in English football.",
      "The current United ownership have stressed the importance of not making similar mistakes in the transfer market, given their torrid fall from grace. And yet, taking inspiration from the Sir Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford could see them restore their place at England's top table.",
      "Under Ferguson, United would have the best of English talents - Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick. Wharton has the potential to be right among that calibre of players.",
      "Also just 21-years-old, his best years are ahead of him and if continues to perform as he has for Palace, it's only a matter of time before a top club comes calling. Manchester United should be at the front of the queue.",

      "Trossard missed both of Arsenal's final two pre-season friendlies after sustaining a groin injury in their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur during their pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong.",
      "After missing the Gunners' 3-2 defeat to Villarreal at the Emirates Stadium last Wednesday, some supporters were hopeful of seeing the Belgian back in action for Saturday's 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "However, he was again absent from the matchday squad, sparking fears he could miss the Premier League curtain-raiser at Old Trafford.",
      "Arteta, though, is confident he will be in contention to make the squad for the clash with United, explaining: \"I think he's going to be [okay] in a few days, yes, a little niggle in the groin. But he should be fine.\"",
      "Trossard featured in all three of Arsenal's tour friendlies, starting the 3-2 win over Newcastle United and coming off the bench against both AC Milan and Tottenham.",
      "The 30-year-old, who joined Arsenal from Brighton & Hove Albion in 2023, was a regular fixture for the Londoners last season, making 56 appearances across all competitions, chipping in with 10 goals and 10 assists.",
      "Trossard scored the winner for Arsenal when they won 1-0 at Old Trafford in the Premier League in May last year.",
      "Elsewhere, the only other injury concern playing on Arteta's mind ahead of the trip to M16 is Gabriel Jesus, who has not played since January and remains a long-term absentee.",

      "Manchester United's new signings demonstrate that the club's legacy continues to make it a dream move for players to arrive at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite facing a season without European football, Ruben Amorim's side has managed to secure three highly-rated forwards this summer. There may have been concerns about United's appeal in the transfer market after they finished 15th in the Premier League and suffered defeat in the Europa League final last season, missing out on a Champions League spot.",
      "However, in their latest transfer swoop, United outmanoeuvred Newcastle to sign striker Benjamin Sesko, Fellow newcomers Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who was also on Newcastle's radar, already understood why Sesko was so keen to make the move.",
      "Upon becoming United's first summer signing, Cunha shared: \"It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player. Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother's house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.\"",
      "Similarly, Mbeumo admitted to being a United fan as a child, highlighting the club's lasting appeal: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up. \"",
      "Despite Sir Alex Ferguson stepping down as United boss in 2013, the club's halcyon days still resonate with players like Sesko. \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" the young striker said. \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.\"",
      "United's success in landing their preferred signings sharply contrasts with Newcastle's troubles in the transfer window. A number of strikers, including Mbeumo and Sesko, have opted for different clubs despite Newcastle's recent trophy win and Champions League qualification.",
      "Meanwhile, United manager Amorim will be looking forward to piecing together his revamped attack. With an urgent need for a centre-forward after Hojlund and Zirkzee's struggles for goals last term, Amorim is confident that Sesko is the right player to spearhead United's frontline.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" Amorim told MUTV. \"Ben is a player - with all the information that we have - that we need to stop the guy from working, not the opposite!",
      "\"So that is also important. He's really young. He's good in the air, he's good at running the channels, good on the ball. I think he has great potential.",
      "\"I think he can improve a lot and, for sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He has the right character to be in this group, so I'm really happy to have him.\"",
      "Yet, United's summer overhaul is far from complete. Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, who commands a valuation of about £100m, has been identified as the next piece in United's puzzle as they aim to strengthen another key area of the squad.",
      "United were also pleased to see club legend David De Gea return to Old Trafford for their last pre-season game on Saturday. Amorim's side played out a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina, with the manager using the match to fine-tune his side ahead of their season opener against Arsenal next Sunday.",

      "Onana has had two error-strewn seasons and missed the entirety of United's pre-season schedule with a hamstring injury. Onana is hopeful of regaining fitness for the Premier League opening fixture against Arsenal next week.",
      "De Gea is under contract at Fiorentina until 2028. La Viola finished sixth last season to qualify for the Europa League and De Gea helped them to reach the Europa Conference League semi-finals in his first season.",
      "\"Sometimes football is like it is,\" De Gea said of his United exit. \"You can't control everything. I've been here 12 years, very, very nice, it's one of the best periods of my life.",
      "\"Playing for this club is just unbelievable, especially when you leave the club, you realise how big is the club, how difficult it was to be 12 years in a club like United. I'm always grateful for this club, for everyone, it's been an amazing journey.",
      "\"Great, sometimes it’s difficult to describe with words how you feel on the pitch, seeing the crowd, the players, everybody there, it was emotional for me. It’s a game that I’ll never forget for sure.\"",
      "United came eighth and 15th in successive seasons without De Gea, their lowest finishes since 1990. The club salvaged the 2023-24 season with an FA Cup triumph but lost to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final last season.",
      "De Gea, who went more than a year without playing until he joined Fiorentina a year ago, is hopeful United will regain form in Ruben Amorim's first full season.",
      "\"Sometimes this is football, you can't win all the time,\" De Gea added. \"I know it's been some years that United struggle a bit but it's one of the best clubs in the world, it's a massive club and hopefully this year with the new signings and the manager starting a new era they can do something big and that's it.",
      "\"Hopefully this year they can win something and be there where they deserve.\"",
      "De Gea joined United at the age of 21 in 2011 from Atletico Madrid for £18.9m and went on to play 545 times for the club. De Gea set new records for most appearances by a United 'keeper and most clean sheets.",
      "The former Spain international met up with Sir Alex Ferguson during Fiorentina's stay in Manchester and reconnected with former teammate and friend Bruno Fernandes, who presented De Gea with a commemorative frame before kick-off at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was great,\" De Gea said of his return. \"It’s been a long time since I came back here so it’s been a special day. Old friends, people that I’ve been with a lot of time, I had a lot of love from them. Very special coming to Old Trafford, onto the pitch, with nearly a full stadium, it was amazing.",
      "\"He (Ferguson)’s the boss, the reason why I came to United. So yeah, he’s very important to me. He’s always talking to me, helping, he’s a legend for the club, everybody loves him. So happy to see him.\"",

      "Former Manchester United winger Mason Greenwood was involved in an on-pitch brawl during Marseille's pre-season victory over Aston Villa.",
      "The incident was sparked after Amadou Onana was caught late by the forward. Onana appeared to take exception to the challenge and the pair appeared to be squaring up to each other when centre-back Tyrone Mings got involved.",
      "The situation soon escalated with Mings grabbing Greenwood by his shirt and tugging him back and forth as both sets of players tried to break up the incident. In the aftermath, Greenwood's shirt was visibly ripped by the defender but neither man was sent off.",
      "Greenwood had scored the opener for Marseille against Villa in a game that they would ultimately win 3-1 thanks to a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang brace in the second half. After the game, Greenwood took to Instagram to share an update as he posted action shots from the win.",
      "He did not reference the fight on social media but did repost a clip of him shrugging off the challenge of Mings before slotting the ball away for the opener. Greenwood left United last summer after being suspended by the club in January 2022 amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour.",
      "All charges were later dropped and the winger would join Getafe on loan on deadline day in the summer of 2023. His permanent move to Marseille in 2024 saw United include a substantial sell-on clause in the deal should Marseille choose to sell him in the future.",
      "The 23-year-old scored 21 Ligue 1 goals last season and there was reports that he could be set for a move back to the Premier League. However, a transfer did not materialise and Greenwood looks set to represent Marseille in the Champions League this season.",

      "Ruben Amorim has warned Manchester United still need to improve and could \"struggle in some moments\".",
      "United concluded their pre-season schedule with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina at Old Trafford. The Italians drew first blood in the 8th minute, but a Robin Gosens own goal brought United level.",
      "With the game locked at 1-1 after 90 minutes, United won a penalty shootout to win the Snapdragon Cup. They will begin their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Speaking to MUTV after the game, Amorim reflected on his side's performance and suggested improvements were needed in \"different areas\" to prevent United from struggling again.",
      "\"Today was a tough match,\" said Amorim. \"It was important for us to take out the feeling of playing at Old Trafford. I think we had some difficulties, especially in the beginning of the first half, and in the beginning of the second half.",
      "\"They have a lot of mobility and we struggle to find the right moment to press. But then we controlled the game and I think we had a lack of fluidity in the game. We can do better.",
      "\"But I think it was a perfect game for preparation to show us we need to improve in different areas that we are going to struggle in some moments. But sometimes we have players who can make a play and elevate the stadium.\"",
      "Amorim has been backed with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon this summer, and Cunha and Mbeumo started against Fiorentina.",
      "\"I think they are maybe 50 or 60 per cent of what they can do,\" Amorim said. \"I think, like any other team, we are going to improve during the season and they are going to be so much better.",
      "\"In some moments, I felt we needed because of the one against ones, we struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we'll see.\"",
      "Amorim also challenged his players to prove they should be in the starting XI against Arsenal with their performances in training next week.",
      "\"That is a good thing, it's supposed to be like that, not like last season when we had to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch,\" he responded when asked about having a selection headache.",
      "\"This is a normal thing, so I have to think and they need to fight during the week so they can change my mind. I have one idea, but they can change my mind during the week.",
      "\"It's going to be tough [training before Arsenal]. We try to arrange a full week of training, so we'll have two really strong sessions with time to work. Then we'll break a little bit.\"",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko arrives at Old Trafford for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, and the striker has signed a five-year contract.",
      "United were confident Sesko preferred a move to Manchester over Newcastle and moved swiftly to wrap up a deal. Newcastle submitted a more lucrative package, but Sesko's preference was decisive.",
      "In a statement, United said: \"Manchester United is pleased to confirm that Benjamin Sesko has joined the club, subject to registration. The Slovenia international has signed a contract until June 2030.",
      "\"Over the past two seasons, Sesko has scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe’s top five leagues. The 22-year-old scored 21 goals and registered six assists for RB Leipzig during the last campaign.",
      "\"He has already been capped 41 times and scored 16 goals for Slovenia since becoming his country's youngest-ever debutant in 2021.\"",
      "After Aston Villa reiterated Ollie Watkins was not for sale, United turned their attention to Sesko. This summer was earmarked for a move away from Leipzig for Sesko, who attracted interest from Arsenal at the beginning of the window.",
      "United were interested in signing Sesko in the summer of 2022 and his agent visited Carrington, but the forward decided to sign for Leipzig from the fellow Red Bull franchise FC Salzburg.",
      "Sesko is regarded as one of Europe's most exciting young centre-forwards. He scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and has netted 16 goals in 41 games for Slovenia's national team.",
      "The 22-year-old travelled to Manchester in a private jet on Thursday evening alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic, to complete his transfer to United.",
      "The confirmation of Sesko's transfer means Ruben Amorim has overhauled his attack in a single window, following a season in which United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League.",
      "United spent an initial combined £127.5m to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively. United have deliberately gone for Premier League-proven players, but staff believe Sesko can develop into one of the world's best strikers.",
      "Sesko's move creates uncertainty for Rasmus Hojlund. United are prepared to make a PSR loss on Hojlund this summer and are understood to be willing to listen to offers in the region of £30m.",
      "United begin the 2025/26 Premier League campaign against Arsenal next Sunday.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United were on the brink of signing French defender Benjamin Pavard two years ago, but the deal was scuppered when Harry Maguire's move to West Ham fell through.",
      "The England centre-back, who joined the Red Devils in a huge £80million deal from Leicester City in July 2019, has experienced a rollercoaster ride at Old Trafford, with his performances drawing criticism from United legend Roy Keane and frustrating sections of supporters.",
      "By the summer of 2023, it seemed Maguire's time at United was coming to an end. Under former manager Erik ten Hag, the then 32-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements and even stripped of the club captaincy, with Maguire later addressing his struggles.",
      "The collapsed transfer had significant repercussions for United. They needed the £30m from Maguire's sale to secure Pavard, who was in the final year of his contract at Bayern Munich and wanted out amid United's interest.",
      "Sky claim a deal was \"ready to go\" for him. But that never materialised as a result, and he has since moved to Inter Milan.",
      "That summer, United had already splashed out nearly £200m on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund. With Financial Fair Play regulations limiting their spending, they couldn't afford Pavard, now 29, without first receiving the funds from Maguire's sale.",
      "Ruben Amorim's arrival in November 2024 appeared to signal yet another potential conclusion to Maguire's United journey. Nevertheless, the Sheffield-born defender battled his way back into contention and proved he could still compete at the highest level, despite United's disappointing 15th-place Premier League finish last term.",
      "Such is Amorim's confidence in the centre-back that reports indicate he's prepared to retain Maguire despite widespread speculation linking him with a move away. The situation is further complicated given the former Leicester City man's contract expires next summer, leaving him free to negotiate with foreign clubs from January.",
      "In a remarkable demonstration of trust from Amorim, the ex-Sporting CP manager has even named Maguire in a six-man leadership collective, alongside Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "According to The Mail, Maguire is eager to sign a new deal that would allow him to see out his playing days at United. The club are reportedly content with such an arrangement, though negotiations have yet to commence.",
      "Maguire's revival at United has been nothing short of extraordinary, with United icon Rio Ferdinand recently describing it as though the player had \"come back from the dead.\"",
      "The former England international also revealed he'd spoken to Maguire about his struggles at Old Trafford. \"We had the tough questions like that, what's it like you having criticism? And someone who risen from the dead almost, shown character,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"He was down and out, but he's come back. So to show that character and resilience, it was nice to just get beneath the skin and talk with him about it.\"",

      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘direct meetings’ for the signing of a Champions League-winning star who’s been told to find a new club.",
      "United have done a good job improving their forward line this summer. Last term, no Red Devil surpassed 10 Premier League goals, and only Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo got to eight.",
      "As a result, three new attackers have been signed: Matheus Cunha, Bryam Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. They scored 17, 20 and 21 goals respectively last term, and should be a huge help to United’s attack.",
      "But other areas of the pitch are in need of a touch-up following a 15th-placed Premier League finish. Andre Onana made three errors leading to goals in the league last season, and United have been on the hunt for a new goalkeeper.",
      "Amid the revelation that Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has been told to find a new club – despite keeping six clean sheets in his club’s triumphant Champions League campaign last season, including one in the final – United have been looking at him.",
      "Now, Centre Devils reports the club have ‘held direct meetings’ for Donnarumma. Ruben Amorim is said to be a ‘big fan’ of the Italian goalkeeper, and is therefore considering him as United’s next No.1.",
      "That builds on reports which detailed why Donnarumma looks likely to be leaving PSG. It is suggested that the French club expect offers from United, Chelsea or Inter Milan, who have all collected information from the goalkeeper’s agent, Enzo Raiola.",
      "It was also said that with one year left on his deal in Paris, Donnarumma wanted to extend his deal, but could not come to an agreement with his club.",
      "Already one of the highest earners at the club, the Italian is said to have wanted a pay rise, and refused to accept the new salary structure of lower wages with big incentives on performances.",
      "Whether United would be able to give the Champions League winner the type of contract he wants, and probably deserves after his performances last season, remains to be seen.",
      "They have spent a lot of money on transfers this summer and thus far have not recouped any of it in sales. Wantaways Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are all yet to be sold, so that could bring in some cash.",
      "But whether that goes towards the signing of Donnarumma remains to be seen.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United and Chelsea have ‘made contact’ over signing Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has revealed two signings he would ‘love’ after Manchester United land Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Man Utd still “really want” to complete a deal to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa but a deal for Gianluigi Donnarumma has been ruled out.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the truth about rumours that Man Utd could sign Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Man Utd are ‘in talks’ with Paris Saint-Germain to complete a stunning summer signing, with the transfer very much ‘ON’.",

      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might if a new-look City make a stumbling start and he decides to sod it all for a game of soldiers.",
      "",
      "15=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "15=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",

      "",
      "14) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "9) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nAnother really interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four points adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we’ve said elsewhere, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "4=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "4=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "1) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "La Liga giants Real Madrid are planning an ‘early offer’ to sign youngster Max Dowman from Premier League side Arsenal, according to reports.",
      "Valencia have reportedly viewed a comment by Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta as a ‘threat’ following the sale of Cristhian Mosquera to the Premier League club.",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "The idea that Mikel Arteta must either win the Premier League title this season or be sacked by Arsenal next summer is flawed for a number of reasons."

      "Tottenham: Pape Sarr as a No. 10\nNot ideal when your final game before a contractually obliged ritual humiliation against PSG ends in a 4-0 defeat to Bayern Munich and where you could fill at least three slots on this feature before even considering any other club.",
      "Dominic Solanke’s injury is apparently minor enough that we can just about look past the fact Richarlison is starting up front for Spurs in big 2025.",
      "Richarlison will be moved on if Spurs get the rest of the window anything other than catastrophically wrong, so expect to see him play 35 Premier League games this season.",
      "We still think the more glaring problem in the starting XI in Munich concerns a player who clearly does have a Spurs future, just not in the position he’s currently being deployed. Pape Sarr is a fine young midfielder with a varied toolbox. We’re keen on him.",
      "But he is not, and we suspect never will be, a creative No. 10. There are worse midfield threes than him, Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha for sure, but there aren’t many less progressive ones.",
      "In the absence of anyone notably prolific within the front three, it’s going to be a long and dreary season watching Spurs bash their head against brick wall after brick wall if they don’t come up with some kind of solution to the long-term absence of both James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski.",
      "Savinho would be a start, for sure, even if he would join the ranks of Spurs attackers who prefer starting from wide rather than operating through the middle.",

      "Liverpool: Waturu Endo as substitute centre-back option\nLet’s all agree that there is very little wrong with Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate as a first-choice central-defensive pairing, but both looked way off it in the Community Shield on Sunday.",
      "And if Arne Slot was minded to do something about that it would be a thought instantly cast from his mind by a glance along a substitutes’ bench that revealed Endo as the closest thing available to another centre-back.",
      "Liverpool have spent giant wads of cash making their title-winning team even better, with the current conspicuous exception of centre-back where Jarell Quansah’s sale is the only significant change.",
      "They appear to be relying on at least one of Konate and Joe Gomez being available at all times, which doesn’t have a vast amount of historical data to support it. And even then it relies on the notion that a 34-year-old Van Dijk can simply be asked to play all of the football all of the time to a consistently excellent standard.",
      "It’s been noted elsewhere, but Marc Guehi having such a fine game against Liverpool’s sparkling array of attacking options in a game where Palace frequently exposed Liverpool’s under-stocked defence might not actually prove to be good news for Palace in the longer term.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Anthony Gordon as centre-forward\nIt has not been a fun summer for Newcastle, with the worst part of a 2-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the coveted Sela Cup not even the fact they had little choice but to start with Anthony Gordon up front, but the sight of him hobbling off in the closing stages.",
      "So now, among everything else they’ve got to contend with, they’ve gone from the frying pan of ‘Anthony Gordon is our starting centre-forward’ to the fire of ‘We must desperately hope Anthony Gordon is fit enough to be our starting centre-forward’.",
      "The Alexander Isak situation is no good at all for Newcastle, very obviously, but it’s far from the only worry. Jamaal Lascelles was captain against Atleti, for instance. With all due respect, Jamaal Lascelles captaining Newcastle in 2025 would have been some way down the list of post-takeover ambitions,",
      "Nevertheless, because we are sickos, we do want to see precisely what happens should Newcastle find themselves having to play an entire season with an attack made up of assorted flavour of tricky winger. Gordon, Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga has the look of an enormously fun, if not particularly effective, attacking trio, one where they’re all either constantly far too far apart or treading on each other’s toes and where Newcastle go from Isak’s elite goalscoring to finishing this season with Joelinton (9) as their top league goalscorer.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Casemiro in central midfield\nManchester United, we need you to be so serious right now. Please tell us your elaborate transfer masterplan, one that started with having to sack all manner of regular Joe Sixpacks while pleading poverty and then spending hundreds of millions of pounds on all manner of new players while recouping almost none of that in sales doesn’t also involve Casemiro as a starter?",
      "We’re reeling so hard from the sight of this a week before the start of the season that we’ve barely even registered a front three of Mbuemo, Mount and Cunha. We do at least know United have taken steps to remedy that with the arrival of the big-jumping and occasional goal-scoring Benjamin Sesko, a man who definitely won’t be the latest not-quite-elite striker to be chewed up and spat out by the sheer ridiculousness of this particular Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Robert Sanchez as goalkeeper\nIt’s now a new thing, it’s not even just a pre-season thing. But however much we may come to rationalise the idea that Chelsea’s insane transfer policy might in fact be perfectly suited to football’s insane world, we will never, ever allow it to become normalised that here lies a football club willing to spend half-a-billion pounds a year putting elite players on eight-year contracts yet continuing to entrust a really very important job indeed to a man who couldn’t keep Jason Steele out of the Brighton team.",
      "Chelsea have loads of goalkeepers, because Chelsea have loads of footballers. It’s what they do. But how are we still in a situation where every single one of those many, many goalkeepers sits somewhere between ‘sh*tbone awful’ and ‘meh’ on the tried-and-tested goalkeeper-quality rating scale?",
      "Of all the things we don’t really understand or even pretend to understand about how Chelsea’s transfer policy works, this is the thing we don’t understand the most. Especially now they have actual strikers."

      "Chelsea could solve a defensive problem for Liverpool while fixing one of their own, and Jack Grealish is finally getting out of Manchester City…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Liverpool\nApparently, the Reds have shown some late interest in Wissa and you have to admire their determination to ruin Newcastle’s summer. But Wissa has come this far down the Toon road and he’s only got eyes for them.",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThis rumour keeps coming and going, but PSG’s signing of Lucas Chevalier certainly opens the door for Donnarumma’s departure, which was unthinkable when he was thwarting Arsenal, Aston Villa and Liverpool in the Champions League. ESPN reckon United, Chelsea and Inter are expected to make an offer. The Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "",
      "18) Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Newcastle\nVilla were interested before they spent £26million on Evann Guessand and we know Porto will sell if the price is right, so this could be a go-er. Assuming Newcastle bank a fee for Isak, Porto will want as close as possible to the £86million release clause in the 21-year-old’s contract. Or at least something like the Toon were willing to pay for Sesko.",

      "",
      "17) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But, knowing what we do about both clubs, we just can’t see it this summer.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Ibrahima Konate – Liverpool to Chelsea\nThere are whispers that Chelsea will offer £43million for Konate in the wake of Levi Colwill’s knee injury. Liverpool would prefer not to sell to a Premier League rival, but it would see them avoid losing the centre-back for nothing next summer. And they could immediately transfer the cash to Palace for Marc Guehi. So it makes a lot of sense, if they can just park the thought of aiding Chelsea.",
      "",
      "15) Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation. Nantes’ Matthis Abline is being eyed as a possible replacement should Newcastle come for Larsen.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Ben Doak – Liverpool to Leeds\nLeeds are one of a few clubs interested in the winger, for whom Liverpool will probably bank around £20million. West Ham are also sniffing, but Daniel Farke turned the screw on his board at the weekend by highlighting how weak his attack currently appears.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a £40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpool’s struggles in defence against Palace in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwill’s injury.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked, and would prefer a loan with an option. Which does United little to no good.",
      "",
      "11) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt is pushing a fortnight sine Liverpool’s first bid for Isak was very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east, and Newcastle have reportedly told their ‘furious’ star that he’s not leaving. But we doubt this is dead yet.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. It seems they need to sell before they really get into it with Palace, who have always been clear that they expect the £68million necessary to buy Eze out of his contract.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is £25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentford’s time with another low-ball bid.",
      "",
      "6) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back £40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United. The Red Devils want at least £40million having watched Noni Madueke move for more and that seems to be the sticking point. Lots of talk of agreements between Chelsea and the player, but United won’t give him away. Yet.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Malick Thiaw – AC Milan to Newcastle\nWe have a Newcastle ‘Here we go’, and a player who ‘only wanted’ them. The end is nigh, folks. Thiaw is in Tyneside for a medical.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\n“I think it will happen,” said Andoni Iraola, who is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nGrealish is having his medical at Everton on Monday with a loan deal between the clubs agreed. We officially approve of this move. And that’s the endorsement everyone craves.",

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st – £53.1m",

      "3rd – £47.7m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",

      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "Manchester United legend Mikael Silvestre has warned the club there are “not a lot” of the type of player they are willing to let go of around, and they should “absolutely not” rush into seeing the back of him.",
      "United have had a successful summer in terms of incomings. They have spent around £200million on attacking talents Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, as well as young left-back Diego Leon.",
      "The outgoings have not been as regular. Marcus Rashford is the only big first-team player to leave, having gone on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Another forward could also be pushed out as a result of the signing of Sesko, as multiple reports have suggested that addition has meant there’s no space for Rasmus Hojlund anymore.",
      "Speaking about the signing of the RB Leipzig striker, United legend Silvestre warned Ruben Amorim and the Red Devils board that should not mean Hojlund is sold.",
      "He said: “Marcus Rashford has gone and there are not a lot of strikers around, Joshua Zirkzee is a different type of striker that doesn’t make those runs in behind the defence.",
      "“He is another type of player for certain games, certain opposition. But no, you need competition, need quality, so I wouldn’t rush into sending Rasmus Hojlund out on loan. Absolutely not.”",
      "There is a chance that it’s not just a loan deal that Hojlund leaves on, as reports have suggested United would actually prefer to sell him, while the Denmark international is now ‘reluctantly ready to leave’.",
      "Transfer insider Ben Jacobs has said: ‘Rasmus Hojlund has now been directly told he’ll need to leave to gain minutes this season and is considering his options. Manchester United prefer to sell, but have not ruled out a loan. Milan prepared to meet #MUFC’s £40m valuation via a loan fee and buy option. Further talks took place yesterday.’",
      "As a result of United telling Hojlund to leave, though some don’t think he should, it is suggested he has accepted that might be best.",
      "Indeed, it’s been stated he is reluctantly ready to leave – despite recently suggesting he is hopeful that he can stay and fight for his place at just 22 years old – and sources are accepting that Sesko’s arrival means the Dane’s days are numbered.",
      "After he scored just four Premier League goals in 32 games last season, it’s not a surprise that United have both signed a new striker, and will prioritise him and Zirkzee, who was signed after Hojlund and still has the faith of the coaches despite a lean first season.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund has now ‘reluctantly’ accepted that he will have to leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund’s Man Utd career appears to be on borrowed time after he was sent a ‘clear message’ from Ruben Amorim, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light.",
      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’."

      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has reportedly ‘verbally asked’ his club to let him join Manchester United, while his agent has agreed to United’s proposal on personal terms.",
      "United’s focus was always reportedly likely to switch to the midfield once they had fixed their striker problems. They had gotten Matheus Cunha early in the window for a wide role, and added Bryan Mbeumo to the other side not long after.",
      "It took them longer to secure a striker, but they did so but signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, beating Premier League rivals Newcastle to the transfer.",
      "While that was still ongoing, interest in Brighton’s Baleba was revealed, and the player himself seems to be angling for a move.",
      "According to insider X account indykaila, not only does the midfielder want out of Brighton, but he has ‘verbally asked’ them to let him move to United.",
      "His agent is also said to have ‘given the thumbs up’ on the offer of personal terms at Old Trafford if the Seagulls allow the midfielder to leave.",
      "It is said that Brighton will not budge from their £100million valuation, so that’s what United have to reach if they’re going to have any chance of signing Baleba.",
      "Whether they’ll be able to do that after spending around £200million on players already is a big question. There are still the potential exits of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia to bring in some money.",
      "Whether they would raise the funds needed to sign Baleba remains to be seen.",
      "But if the midfielder is not sold by Brighton in this window, it seems his value will continue to rise. While reports have placed the midfielder at the £100million mark, insider David Ornstein has suggested United haven’t been told that, but Brighton expect Baleba’s price to climb.",
      "He said: ‘Brighton’s preference is to keep Carlos Baleba until at least summer 2026. Manchester United have made an enquiry via intermediaries and were not quoted a price. The Brighton hierarchy believe Baleba can be worth as much as Moises Caicedo one day, who the club sold to #CFC for £115m.’",
      "The Seagulls have always known when they are able to demand a top price for their stars, with Caicedo the most famous example, alongside others such as Alexis Mac Allister, who with add-ons was said to potentially reach £55million, Marc Cucurella, who cost Chelsea £56million, and Robert Sanchez, who cost the Blues £25million.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have joined Manchester United in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League giants Brighton.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has revealed two signings he would ‘love’ after Manchester United land Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Man Utd will have to look elsewhere this summer after Brighton made it clear that Carlos Baleba is not for sale, according to reports.",
      "Man City have joined rivals Man Utd in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League side Brighton this summer, according to reports.",
      "Brighton want £104m for Manchester United target Carlos Baleba, who ‘is happy to stay at the Amex’ for another season, according to a report.",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down."

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund has now ‘reluctantly’ accepted that he will have to leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m earlier this week to complete a new attacking trident with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also joining earlier this summer.",
      "Man Utd have now addressed their lack of attacking capabilities from last season with only four Premier League sides scoring fewer goals than Ruben Amorim’s side as they finished 15th.",
      "Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee came in for lots of criticism with the duo scoring just seven Premier League goals between them last term.",
      "And now Hojlund looks likely to be the man to leave as Man Utd look to recoup funds after bringing in Sesko for big money with AC Milan reportedly interested.",
      "Before Sesko signed, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano hinted that Hojlund could be the man to leave if the striker signed from RB Leipzig.",
      "READ: Seven ways Manchester United have ‘huge advantage’ in title race revealed with Isak threat to fail",
      "Romano said last week: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "While Hojlund was publicly clear that he wanted to stay, he told reporters last week: “I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22.",
      "“Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",

      "Sesko arrived from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m, while Cunha joined from Wolves for £62.5m and Mbeumo signed from Brentford in a £65m transfer.",
      "The huge investment in the trio is a reaction to a season in which only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd as Ruben Amorim’s side finished 15th.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer, with AC Milan reportedly interested, and now Man Utd could add Calvert-Lewin as back up.",
      "Ben Jacobs revealed interest from Newcastle in Calvert-Lewin last month, he wrote on X: ‘Newcastle retain an interest in Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but are reticent to meet his terms. Nothing is advanced currently, nor has a new offer been presented to Calvert-Lewin so far. #NUFC are still assessing several options after missing out on Joao Pedro, and learning Callum Wilson would not extend.",

      "‘A move will only progress if Calvert-Lewin reduces his terms from 12 months ago when #NUFC made a concrete offer. And even then, Newcastle are somewhat wary of Calvert-Lewin’s injury record.’",
      "Around the same time in early July, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave an update on Man Utd interest in Calvert-Lewin, he said: “What happened with Calvert-Lewin is that the player has been offered to Manchester United.",
      "“It’s not that Man United started negotiations for Calvert-Lewin as new striker. The player has been offered as an opportunity on a free transfer, a cheap opportunity for a player who has experience, knows the league and can be helpful for any club.",
      "“So Man United registered the eventual cost of the deal. It means, obviously, the salary, the commission, the intention of the player, who would be, obviously, very open and excited to join Manchester United eventually in this summer transfer window.",
      "“But at the moment, it’s not yet a concrete negotiation.”",
      "While there were other reports around the same time claiming that Man Utd had pulled out of a deal for the former Everton striker over a ‘major red flag’.",
      "It was understood at the time that ‘any potential deal is off as influential figures stopped short of engaging in prolonged discussions due to identifying his injury record as a major red flag when going in search of fresh firepower’.",
      "But now Caught Offside claim Man Utd are considering the England international ‘as back-up option’ ‘exploring the possibility of adding Calvert-Lewin to Ruben Amorim’s squad as a depth option in attack’.",

      "",
      "So a poster asked where will everyone play.",
      "I think you can sort of tell how we will play and where everyone will play based on two things –",
      "1. Who we bought (more specifically their skillset)",
      "2. The history of the manager",
      "We bought a bunch of players who all have one specific skill in common, and we have sold a bunch of players who don’t have it.\nUnder klopp the aim was to either win it back quick or if in our own half move the ball up top quick, this is why midfield was often workhorses and Trent was leaned on heavily for his passing. It’s also why klopp went for Darwen (a striker who if he timed his runs better would score lots of goals in that system).",
      "We sold Trent, we sold Darwen, we will probably sell Elliot as well. And we brought in kerkez, frimpong, ekitike, wirtz and (maybe?) isak. Anyone see what they have in common?",
      "They are all very good players at carrying the ball through defensive lines, same goes for McAllister and gravenberch. Rather than launching the ball forward as we did under klopp slot will rely more heavily on players keeping the ball at their feet and moving with it or short fast passing.",
      "2. He is a Dutch manager, another thing all these players have in common is they can play dual roles. So the worries about where will wirtz play if we sign isak etc are a bit unfounded. There is likely going to be a lot of swapping and changing similar to what PSG did in the champions League and Cruyff’s Barcelona used to do. The reason is this is a very difficult system to man mark and players like Mac and Salah will benefit as teams can’t double up.",
      "Stop worrying. He won the league in his first year with no signings, I’m sure he has a reason for the things he’s doing.\nLee",
      "",
      "Why Manchester United can shock everyone and win the title\nThere’s a quiet confidence building at Manchester United, and for once it’s not based on nostalgia or blind hope. It’s built on a manager who’s had a full pre-season, three new attackers who each bring something different, and a schedule with no European distractions. Add in rivals with their own uncertainties, and there’s a genuine case to be made: United can go all the way this season.",
      "Rúben Amorim finally gets his clean slate",
      "When Amorim came in last season, he was thrown into the middle of a campaign with someone else’s squad. This summer has been different. He’s had the time to drill his principles, set his standards, and build the side in his image. Amorim has shown he can win trophies in Portugal, but this is the first time he gets to start from zero at Old Trafford.",
      "An attack that looks genuinely dangerous",
      "If there’s been one major weakness in recent seasons, it’s that United’s attack has felt predictable. That’s no longer the case.",
      "Benjamin Šeško: Tall, quick, strong in the air, and able to finish with either foot. A proper focal point.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Direct, tireless, and difficult to mark. His runs inside from the right create space and his delivery from set pieces is a weapon.",
      "Matheus Cunha: The link man. Good close control, clever movement, and the ability to knit attacks together.",
      "This isn’t just adding more goals. It’s adding different types of goals – headers, long-range efforts, first-time finishes, link play – so opponents can’t predict the threat.",
      "No Europe, no problem",
      "One-game weeks are a huge advantage. No Thursday night flights, no rotating half the team for the weekend. It’s more rest, more tactical work, and more energy for the Premier League. Leicester used that to shock the world in 2015/16. Nottingham Forest in 2024/25 spent months in the top four when nobody expected it. A clear calendar can make a massive difference.",
      "The element of surprise",
      "Last season’s United was not Amorim’s United. This is. Opponents don’t yet know how to deal with Šeško, Mbeumo and Cunha together. That unpredictability could fuel a strong start, and in this league, early momentum can carry a team a long way.",
      "The rivals aren’t invincible",
      "Liverpool have brought in new players, but it always takes time for signings to bed in. Manchester City were a little off their usual pace last season and there’s no guarantee they’ll be flawless this time. Arsenal remain strong, but still need to prove they can go the distance under real pressure.",
      "Momentum is everything",
      "Title races often swing on ten-game bursts where a team collects 25 points or more. United have the conditions to produce one of those runs early on – a fresh squad, a manager’s system clicking into place, and new signings bringing belief. Get that run in before Christmas and the title talk becomes serious.",
      "It’s not about being the best on paper",
      "City are still favourites on paper, Arsenal probably look more settled, and Liverpool’s attack remains dangerous. But titles aren’t won on paper. They’re won on the pitch, in the grind, when preparation meets opportunity. Leicester proved it in 2016. Forest showed last season that sustained form over months is possible even for an outsider.",
      "United have the manager, the variety in attack, the focus of a one-game week, and rivals who may not be at full tilt. Keep the key players fit and make the most of the early fixtures, and this could be the season Old Trafford finally gets to celebrate the Premier League trophy again.",
      "Not blind optimism. A real possibility.\nMustafa",
      "",
      "A head of the game\nLast week I was going to write in about how Arsenal needed to adjust their playing style to suit Gyökeres’. That is sit back and give the opposition the ball so we can break away. I know it’s only a couple of freindles but it would appear he’s quite happy to adjust to ours, especially with the class of Zubimendi on the teamsheet!",
      "Apparently Gyōkeres can’t head for toffee….maybe that’s because Sporting didn’t play that sort football. They sit back and play breakaway football and don’t cross the ball in…..we do and Gyōkeres capatilised on them. Xubimendi looks class too.",

      "First, and most importantly, the Serenity prayer states very clearly “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”",
      "I learned many years ago I cannot influence what goes on in the transfer market nor the management of my team and therefore decided not to worry about it. Yes I would like to see Newcastle sign more players, yes I would very much like Isak to stay, yes I would like the team to be strengthened but I have NO CONTROl over any of this so do not worry about it. I acknowledge this will anger the publishers of websites such as yours who depend on so-called fans rushing to agonise over every latest rumor, gossip, piece of misinformation regularly published in search of eyeballs for advertisements, but so be it.",
      "And second, I don’t think Newcastle United’s Inability to attract players is because the club is located somewhere near the Arctic Circle. As much as it pains me to say this, Sunderland appear to have done a really good job this summer bringing in new quality players (seven not including loanees) so I don’t think being located north of The Wall with WhiteWalkers our biggest fans plays much of a role here. I think in Newcstale’s case it has more to do with the breakdown in management since Amanda left. But again, I have no control over this, so do not worry.",

      "Rodri (Manchester City)\nAfter missing most of last season with an ACL injury, Rodri is expected back after the first international break. He’s still the Ballon d’Or holder and one of the best midfielders in the game. It will be interesting to see how he performs post-injury.",
      "",
      "Ruben Dias (Manchester City)\nSlightly past his peak, but still world class. Injuries are becoming more of a problem, and if his availability drops further he could lose that label.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)\nComfortably United’s only world-class player. Bruno carried a shambolic side last season. The arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko should take some of the pressure off him. Whether Sesko is another Rasmus Hojlund or the next Robin van Persie remains to be seen.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – £66.2m/€76.5m (RB Leipzig to Manchester United, August 2025)\nThe hope is that Sesko can be enough of a success in his first permanent spell outside the Red Bull bubble to trigger a further £7.36m in add-ons in this ongoing Manchester United rebuild. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have set the bar high.",
      "",
      "13) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "14) Victor Osimhen – £64.8m/€75m (Napoli to Galatasaray, July 2025)\nA decent haul of 37 goals and eight assists in 41 games on loan inspired Galatasaray to a league and cup double while convincing them Osimhen was entirely worth absolutely obliterating a Turkish transfer record which had previously stood at around €20m.",
      "",
      "15) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "16) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nTwo trophies, 40 goals and 26 assists in 143 appearances might well have activated clauses taking the deal to the full £85m in cost but Liverpool will be thrilled to get half their money back from Al-Hilal in truth.",
      "",
      "17) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "18) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "19) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "20) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",

      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",

      "8) Sunderland – £122.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Atletico Madrid – £133.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "6) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Lucas Chevalier – £34.6m/€40m (Lille to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2025)\nLike Jerzy Dudek in 2005, Gianluigi Donnarumma was granted a few weeks to bathe in the glory of a Champions League winner’s medal his heroics helped deliver before being informed he was surplus to requirements. If you don’t fall in line with PSG’s wage structure, you will be replaced.",
      "",
      "7) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "8) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "9) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "10) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "11) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "12) James Trafford – £27m/€31.2m (Burnley to Manchester City, July 2025)\nBurnley are claiming that they have sold Trafford for a British record fee for a goalkeeper but City sources place the deal at £27m plus add-ons. Newcastle were willing to pay that sum but, not for the first time, their lure was far less than City’s.",
      "",
      "13) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "14) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "15) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "16) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "17) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",

      "Saturday 9 August 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Manchester United beat Fiorentina on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the Snapdragon Cup at Old Trafford that saw Benjamin Sesko introduced to the crowd as their new striker.",
      "Sesko's move from RB Leipzig for a fee rising to £73.7m was confirmed on the morning of the match and he was presented to supporters on the pitch alongside fellow new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who both started for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "With the £50m revamp of their Carrington training ground also unveiled this week, there is a growing sense of renewal at United, although it did not take long for Fiorentina to pierce that when Simon Sohm seized upon sloppy defending to put the visitors ahead at a corner.",
      "United levelled it up midway through the first half when Bruno Fernandes whipped in a cross that Robin Gosens appeared to divert over the line amid a melee of bodies. David de Gea, honoured beforehand by his old club, was among those complaining of a foul.",
      "Sohm almost scored again after the break, striking the United crossbar. Fernandes, Harry Maguire and, in particular, Cunha searched for a winner for the home side in a second half that saw young defender Ayden Heaven depart the field due to an injury.",
      "De Gea received a standing ovation when substituted late on, which prevented him taking part in the penalty shoot-out that United won when Altay Bayindir saved Fabiano Parisi's kick, allowing Kobbie Mainoo to secure the victory for the Red Devils.",
      "0-1 GOAL! Moise Kean scores\n\n1-1 GOAL! Bruno Fernandes scores\n\n1-2 GOAL! Jacopo Fazzini scores\n\n2-2 GOAL! Matheus Cunha scores\n\n2-3 GOAL! Abdelhamid Sabiri scores\n\n3-3 GOAL!

      "\"We had some difficulties, especially in the beginning of the first half and the beginning of the second half. They have a lot of mobility and we struggled to find the right moment to press. But then we controlled the game.",
      "\"We had a lack of fluidity in the game. We can do better. But I think it was a perfect game of preparation to show us that we need to improve in the different areas and that we are going to struggle in some moments. But sometimes we have players that can make a play and to elevate the stadium.\"",
      "Asked about Mbeumo and Cunha's relationship: \"It's going to be special. I think they are maybe 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.",
      "\"Like any other team, we are going to improve during the season and they are going to be so much better.",
      "\"In some moments, I felt that we need, because of the one-against-one in all the pitch, we struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we'll see.\"",
      "\"Manchester United's need for a new striker was clear with Mason Mount playing as the frontman and Rasmus Hojlund left on the bench. Their threat mainly came from set-pieces and the goal likely would have been ruled out if VAR were in use.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim will be comforted by the presence of Sesko to address that issue in the weeks to come, but the midfield will be a cause for concern for the United head coach.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "\"Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes were not able to dominate this game for Manchester United and the play has been disjointed at times.",
      "\"That will surely be an area of the team Amorim hopes to address in the final three weeks or so of this window. There is an interest in Carlos Baleba, who seems ideally suited to the system.",
      "\"However, it seems unlikely at this stage given Brighton would ask for a huge fee and haven't got a replacement in. The current options aren't ideal for Amorim.\"",

      "Saturday 9 August 2025 18:05, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed a £73.7m deal to sign striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) with £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "In his first interview as a Man Utd player, Sesko said: \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\"",
      "Sesko was formally presented to Man Utd supporters on Saturday, ahead of the club's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "Newcastle had been working on a deal for Sesko, and on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.",
      "United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.",
      "The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd was not lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting Sesko's deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves had been in Leipzig finalising the deal.",
      "Talking about the new signing, Wilcox said: \"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "\"Working under the guidance of Ruben Amorim and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.",
      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Manchester United have been aware of Sesko ever since he moved to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16. They've scouted him for many years and this isn't actually the first time they have tried to sign him. In the summer of 2022 - three years ago now - there was some concrete interest from Man Utd.",
      "Sesko reached an agreement to join Leipzig a year later instead. That was because he didn't feel ready to make that jump to a club in the Premier League. He has now made that big move.",
      "What makes Sesko so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Read Nick Wright's feature here.",
      "Sesko's signing will raise further questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford. It is understood the club would consider offers of around £40m for the player, and AC Milan are interested.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are also interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "Manchester United's deal for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.",
      "Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement. However, with Sesko now heading to Manchester, it puts any possible move for Isak into doubt.",
      "Liverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected by the Magpies.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 23:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "\"I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.\"",
      "The words of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he cut the ribbon to re-open their men's training facilities.",
      "It marks the conclusion of a year's worth of work at Carrington, which has been disruptive to say the least.",
      "The knock-on effect on the men's and women's teams was far from ideal, but the important news for United is that the redevelopment has now finished and importantly, on time and within budget ahead of the new season.",
      "United partnered with Foster + Partners to lead the redesign of Carrington - the same company who are in charge of designing their ambitious 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS first arrived at United 18 months ago, one of their first major decisions was to revamp and invest in Carrington, in their image, as the beating heart of the club.",
      "Although Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating facilities in 2022, perhaps in hindsight, his actions, rightly or wrongly, had an everlasting impact that led to Carrington's improvement.",
      "\"It sends a message that you're playing for the biggest club in the world.\"",
      "United believe that after finishing this huge renovation that their facilities are back to being among the best in class when compared to their rivals - a familiar feeling to when Carrington first opened in 2000.",
      "Dalot was pretty happy with the players' revamped facilities but what are they really like?",
      "United goalkeeper Tom Heaton described the improved facilities as much of a 'flow' for the players. I did not know quite what he meant until I had a look myself, and actually, it made a lot of sense.",
      "From the ground floor, you immediately step into the players' gym - this was one of the only aspects of the building relatively untouched.",
      "However, as you meander through to the active recovery rooms, this is where you start seeing major changes that will benefit United players for years to come.",
      "A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.",
      "Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.",
      "The \"flow\" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.",
      "As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.",
      "However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.",
      "Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.",
      "One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.",
      "One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.",
      "The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.",
      "United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.",
      "The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.",
      "With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.",
      "We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.",
      "On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!",
      "Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.",
      "As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.",
      "My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.",
      "Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford."

      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Man Utd's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",

      "Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",

      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best, so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\"",

      "Chelsea are in talks to sign Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig and Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho; Simons has two years left on his RB Leipzig contract; Garnacho is free to leave Man Utd; Chelsea have spent more than £250m this summer but are also offloading players",
      "By Kaveh Solhekol & Dharmesh Sheth",
      "Monday 4 August 2025 16:25, UK",
      "Chelsea are aiming to sign both Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho before the transfer window closes.",
      "Chelsea are in talks to sign the two forwards, and discussions have been ongoing for some time, with good relations between all the clubs.",
      "Simons was not in RB Leipzig's squad for their friendly on Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, Garnacho is one of several players that Manchester United are looking to move on this summer.",
      "United, who are expecting formal offers for Garnacho later in the window, are aware of Chelsea's interest in the forward, whose future is likely to be away from Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim said over the weekend to journalists in the USA that \"it's clear Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership\".",
      "Amorim believes Garnacho is still a talented player but says things have not worked out for the 21-year-old academy graduate at Old Trafford.",
      "\"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Amorim also revealed that sales this summer are important because he wants a smaller squad this season, given United are not in Europe and will only fight on three fronts.",
      "\"I'm really happy with the team,\" said Amorim. \"Without European competitions, I want a small squad so everyone feels really important.",
      "\"If you have a lot of players, you have one week to prepare and a lot of players are going to be out, and then in training they will be frustrated and then the quality of the training will drop.\"",
      "Chelsea have agreed to a restriction on registering new players for UEFA competitions in the 2025/26 season, unless the value of new signings added to their squad is recouped in sales, after being fined - along with Aston Villa - by UEFA for breaches of its financial rules.",
      "Chelsea have spent more than £250m this summer on eight new signings, with Ajax defender Jorrel Hato their latest addition, and there will be more incomings as players are sold and loaned out.",
      "Nine players have left the club permanently, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Armando Broja, Carney Chukwuemeka, Marc Guiu and Lesley Ugochukwu also expected to leave Stamford Bridge.",
      "Christopher Nkunku, Ben Chilwell and Raheem Sterling are also likely to leave, and question marks remain over the future of Nicolas Jackson.",
      "Chelsea returned for pre-season training on Monday after having three weeks off since winning the Club World Cup.",
