      "Manchester United have matched Newcastle's £73.8million bid for Benjamin Sesko, leaving the RB Leipzig star with the final decision. Sesko, 22, is both clubs' top target, as they each push to sign a striker in the final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "Newcastle were first to lodge a formal bid, going in at £69.5m. Following talks with the Bundesliga club, Eddie Howe's side submitted an improved offer of £69.5m plus £4.3m in add-ons on Monday.",
      "United have now matched that amount, with a proposal worth £65.2m plus £8.6m in add-ons. It's understood that Sesko is training away from Leipzig's first-team squad amid the race to sign him.",
      "Newcastle's decision to pursue the Slovenia international comes after Alexander Isak told club chiefs that he wants to leave amid concrete interest from Liverpool. The Magpies rejected Liverpool's opening bid last week but they're braced for a second offer.",
      "United, on the other hand, want to upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who's available for just £30m after two difficult seasons at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have already signed two forwards this summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After Sesko was left out of Leipzig's pre-season friendly with Atalanta last week, managing director Marcel Schafer confirmed that approaches had been made.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that, but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches,\" Schafer was quoted as saying. \"It's obvious what has happened.\"",
      "Howe has been tight-lipped on Newcastle's interest in Sesko. When asked about the ex-Red Bull Salzburg wonderkid, the Magpies boss told Chronicle Live: \"I am sorry to sound like a broken record, I am aware of what is happening, but I am not dealing with it.",
      "Who should Benjamin Sesko chose - Newcastle or Manchester United? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "\"I woke up today and had two training sessions then came straight here. I am finding out what is happening after it has happened, so we will try to bring the best to the football club - I will make that clear - but I can't talk about individual targets.\"",
      "United's interest in Sesko dates back to when he was 16 at Slovenian club Domzale. The Red Devils' director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, also knows plenty about the 22-year-old. Vivell signed Sesko for both Salzburg and Leipzig during his spells with the two Red Bull-run clubs.",

      "The Magpies have made an improved offer worth £70million for Sesko, while United are yet to officially bid for the 22-year-old. Sesko netted 21 goals in 45 appearances across all competitions last season.",
      "According to a new report from the Athletic, United are also considering potential alternatives to Sesko if Newcastle win the race with Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson on their radar. Chelsea are said to be open to selling Jackson this summer after signing Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, but only if they receive an 'acceptable proposal'.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe, meanwhile, are reporting that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani is another option United are considering. Juventus were the frontrunners for Muani, but it is claimed that deal has now stalled.",
      "As a result, United could now make a move for the 26-year-old, although Tottenham are also said to be interested in Muani.",
      "The news comes after United captain Bruno Fernandes urged the club to make more signings before the new season starts. \"It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,\" Fernandes said after a 2-2 draw with Everton in pre-season.",

      "\"We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand believes Arsenal's teenage sensation Max Dowman is the most exciting English talent since Wayne Rooney. Dowman, despite not even being old enough to sit his GCSEs, has left Gunners talent drooling with his talent during pre-season.",
      "In a summer featuring the arrivals of stars like Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and others, the player Arsenal fans haven't been able to stop watching is the 15-year-old, a product of the club's fabled academy system. Dowman, who has been playing above his age group for a number of years and spent much of last term training with the first team, was included on the north Londoners' pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "And while he may have presumed he was only there for the experience, boss Mikel Arteta had other ideas, desploying him in their friendlies against AC Milan, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, where he immediately made an impression. Dowman, who was born in 2009, has already impressed Declan Rice and the Gunners boss with his mature displays.",
      "Ferdinand, who won his fourth Premier League title the year Dowman was born, has been so captivated by the teen, he thinks he is just as exciting as a young Rooney was. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, the ex-England captain said: \"Dowman excites me on another level. This kid is different.\"",
      "When co-host Joel Beya told Ferdinand, who already sang Dowman's praises last month, that some people are calling the teenager the best talent England has produced since Rooney, he instantly replied: \"Yes. I am saying the same thing.”",
      "After Beya suggested Ferdinand should take it easy with such a comparison, he hit back: \"What? Have you seen him? They’re different. This kid is not Rooney.",
      "\"Just let me put it out there, he is not Rooney. He is not built. He hasn’t got a hairy chest. He hasn’t got a beard at the age of 16. Rooney was a man. A man-child.”",
      "Rooney was responsible for perhaps the most spectacular breakthrough in Premier League history when he made his Everton debut at the age of 16. He came off the bench against Arsenal and crashed home a strike from 30 yards, which smashed off the underside of the crossbar on its way into the net in 2003.",
      "He went on to become United and England's highest-ever goalscorer, until Harry Kane broke the latter record in an away clash against Italy in 2023. While Ferdinand has compared the breakouts of Rooney and Dowman, he did insist they are different types of players.",
      "He added: \"The thing with Wayne Rooney is that he had guile, but he came on with brute force. He was like, 'You’re going to know about me because I’m going to force it down your throat.’",
      "\"This kid is more subtle, more technical. All he is going to do is have people on ice skates, slipping and sliding everywhere. Very rarely do you see a player actually get near him and touch him.",
      "\"He is that elusive. He’s a player who will excite you, get you off your seat. You’ll be going, 'Have you seen that?’ He’s making defenders into memes.”",
      "Dowman is yet to make his full, competitive senior debut for the Gunners, but he appears to have a great chance this season. Arteta has a record of promoting youngsters, having made Ethan Nwaneri the youngest player in Premier League history when he brought him on during a 3-0 victory at Brentford in 2022, aged just 15 years and 181 days old.",

      "Harry Maguire admits that Manchester United's lack of European football this season gives them 'no excuses' in the Premier League. Maguire, 32, has said that the extra time to prepare for league matches should be an advantage for his team-mates and boss Ruben Amorim, who'll have more hours to work with them on the training ground.",
      "United manager Amorim often bemoaned the Red Devils' busy schedule after he was appointed in November. Due to having a fixture either in Europe or domestically every three to four days for the vast majority of the campaign, the Portuguese found it even more difficult to implement his system.",
      "But that's been flipped on its head this term. After finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final last time out, Amorim's side won't be in Europe whatsoever.",
      "It's only the second time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 that the Red Devils will go into a season without European football. For Maguire, he sees it as an opportunity to make sure that they're in tip-top condition to enjoy a much better Premier League campaign.",
      "\"I just want to be part of a successful team this season,\" the defender told MUTV. \"I think last season was a tough season for everyone individually, but also as a team, as a squad, as a club.",
      "\"This season, there are no excuses. We're going to have a lot of time to prepare for the Premier League games, and we've got to make sure we're ready. So, for myself, it's making sure I'm available, I'm fit, I'm ready to go, and give everything I can to this team and this club.\"",
      "Maguire added that he and his team-mates know Amorim's system 'a lot better' following their pre-season tour of the USA, where they largely worked on tactics in training. \"It's something that he reiterated, that we didn't have enough time on the training pitch,\" the England international continued.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"This pre-season, it's been tough on the legs, but the majority of it has been tactical. So, it's nice to do the drills that are tactical rather than running around poles and running around the pitch.",
      "\"It's been an enjoyable pre-season, but a pre-season that we've all learnt from. We know the system a lot better, and we've just got to take that into the games now.\"",

      "Amorim has been overseeing a huge rebuild of his squad this summer as he bids to erase the heartache of last season, when the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League after 18 losses. Marcus Rashford has already departed while four other players have been told to find new clubs.",
      "United have been working on refining their tactics and fitness under Amorim during their pre-season tour in the United States, where they won the Premier League Summer Series, with new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo bedding into the squad.",
      "But while the team have been unbeaten in pre-season so far and look a much improved side, Amorim still isn't satisfied having previously complained that his midfield has \"a lack of pace\".",
      "Collyer was a squad player under Amorim last season as he was given a chance off the bench in ten games and also earned three starts in cup competitions, but the United boss wants more top-level experience to help the team control games.",
      "There have also been concerns over Manuel Ugarte after he struggled in the 2-2 friendly draw with Everton, failing to deal with their physicality and aggressive press.",
      "Casemiro is also not a player Amorim appears to look at with optimism after he showed signs that he was struggling to keep up with the pace of elite football last season.",
      "This season he will be a squad player after he was not mentioned in Amorim's six-man leadership group for the season, despite being included in it under the reign of Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim will be looking to starlet Kobbie Mainoo for the future but for now he will need a suitable option who could play alongside him - or Ugarte.",
      "The club have been linked with moves for Atalanta midfielder Ederson, while Valencia star Javi Guerra is also understood to be a target. Further forward in midfield, United have also been credited with a big-money move for Barcelona's Fermin Lopez.",
      "The biggest priority for Amorim in the transfer market, however, is a new centre forward. The club are in talks to sign Red Bull Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, but face stiff competition from Newcastle, who can offer Champions League football.",

      "The Magpies have identified the Slovenian as their top target in attack with Sesko likely being the replacement for Alexander Isak, who is pushing for a move to Liverpool. Newcastle know that Manchester United too are keen on the Leipzig frontman, but are yet to bid.",
      "It puts Eddie Howe's side in pole position currently to land the striker, who has reportedly told his team-mates in Germany that he will be moving on this summer. Whilst United are interested it is thought that currently they would not pay as much as Newcastle - it comes as United have been slammed for missing out on an Arsenal star after Bruno Fernandes let rip at his team-mates.",
      "Positive talks have been held between Newcastle co-owner Jamie Reuben, Leipzig and the 22-year-old striker, as first reported by the Athletic. Sesko is understood to be open to both projects but Leipzig are adamant that they will not sell until their valuation is met.",
      "The Slovenian is among the brightest young forwards in Europe and the Bundesliga outfit want to ensure they get a fee that reflects that. Leipzig are without Champions League football this term but will not sell their top players on the cheap with some of their other leading lights attracting attention.",
      "Newcastle recently turned down an opening offer of £110m from Liverpool for Isak, who did not feature on the club's recent pre-season tour, citing an injury issue. He was later seen training at former club Real Sociedad.",
      "Isak has now been at St James' Park for three years and has continued to blossom since making a club-record move. He is now among Europe's top strikers but is haggling for a move elsewhere. It is the first time in the Saudi-era at Newcastle that a major name has expressed a desire to push for the exit door, leaving the club with a decision to make.",
      "They value Isak at £150m and are likely to hold out for close to that figure. The Swede has years to run on his contract, meaning Newcastle are not under pressure to sell. They also want to know that they've got a top quality replacement through the door before they consider selling.",
      "Sesko's contract with Leipzig runs through to 2029, but his deal is thought to include a gentleman’s agreement allowing him to leave. He has recorded 39 goals and eight assists in 87 appearances for the German club since moving from RB Salzburg in 2023.",

Former Celtic and Arsenal forward Charlie Nicolas has been left aghast that the team have not tried to work smarter in the transfer window and reckons they should have been in the race for Arsenal signing Christian Norgaard.",

      "RB Leipzig's hierarchy met with Benjamin Sesko and his agent Elvis Basanovic on Sunday night to discuss the striker's possible sale to one of two Premier League clubs.",
      "But the Bundesliga club have firmly rejected Newcastle's initial offer of €75 million plus a €5 million bonus, demanding a guaranteed €80 million up front, while Manchester United remain hopeful of usurping the Toon by bringing the Slovenia star to Old Trafford instead.",
      "Sesko was not in Leipzig's matchday squad for their friendly against Serie A side Atalanta on Saturday afternoon with the much coveted striker kept out amid the tug of war between the Premier League giants.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, are in a separate dispute with their current top marksman Alexander Isak looking to pursue a new challenge. Liverpool remain the frontrunner to sign the Sweden international but his asking price remains an issue.",
      "It is unclear how interlinked Isak's future is with their move for Sesko with manager Eddie Howe previously stating his desire to have two high-class options for every position.",
      "United made their first approach for the Slovenian star last week, through intermediaries, who opened up dialogue over a potential deal. Those talks have progressed and will be stepped up this week, once United have returned home from their three-game tour of the US.",
      "Although United are looking to offload several players before the summer transfer window closes, they have scope to sign a striker without selling. Marcus Rashford's season-long loan move to Barcelona cleared £12m off their annual wage bill, with the La Liga club covering his entire salary.",
      "United also raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses including Anthony Elanga’s switch to Newcastle, moves for Alvaro Fernandez and Maxi Oyedele, and the £5m paid by Chelsea to pull out of their deal to sign Jadon Sancho.",
      "In addition, United's failure to qualify for Europe this season – for only the second time in 35 years - means they are not bound by UEFA'S limit of spending no more than 70 per cent of annual income on transfers and wages.",
      "The structure of the deals for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who cost a combined £133.5m, with payments spread over instalments, has given United greater freedom to spend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Newcastle United have provided a 48-hour deadline regarding their interest in Benjamin Sesko. Eddie Howe’s side have identified the RB Leipzig striker as a target as the club look to add reinforcements in attack.",
      "The Magpies, who are preparing for a Champions League campaign, currently have limited options up front. First-choice striker Alexander Isak has been the subject of a rejected bid worth up to £120million from Liverpool, while the expiry of Callum Wilson’s contract leaves prospect William Osula as the club’s only other recognised centre-forward.",
      "Newcastle have also been linked with a move for Brentford star Yoane Wissa, who scored 19 league goals last term. However, the club are determined not to allow their pursuit of Leipzig forward Sesko to emulate Manchester United’s earlier transfer strategy.",
      "talkSPORT have reported that Newcastle have informed Leipzig of their desire for clarity in terms of Sesko's next steps by Wednesday. It is said that the club are confident of reaching an agreement with the German side.",
      "Leipzig are thought to value the 22-year-old striker at around £70million. Sesko is also a target for Man United and had been on Arsenal's radar prior to the Gunners signing Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "However, the report also claimed that Newcastle feel they must have a clear idea of Sesko’s intentions before the latter half of the week. It is said that Leipzig have yet to receive any formal offers for Sesko, despite recent reports.",
      "Newcastle’s unwillingness to find themselves in a transfer saga is contrary to Man United’s approach to signing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Despite the club’s public interest in Mbeumo, Man United had several offers turned down before the striker finally arrived at Old Trafford in a deal worth up to £71m. Newcastle wish to avoid replicating a similar scenario with Sesko.",
      "The Isak situation provides Newcastle with extra motivation to accelerate negotiations for Sesko and any other transfer targets. Aside from potentially losing a star player, Howe will want to ensure any new recruits have time to settle before the start of an important season for the club.",
      "When asked if he thought Isak would report back to the club as the squad prepared to return from their pre-season tour of Asia, Newcastle boss Howe said: \"Of course I'd like him to be (there), but whether he will I don’t know at this moment in time. We have been here with the time difference, preparing for training and for games. Other people have been dealing with that situation back at home.\"",
      "Isak scored 27 goals across all competitions as Newcastle finally ended their long wait for silverware by winning the Carabao Cup and secured a Champions League spot by finishing fifth in the Premier League. He was brought by Newcastle in for around £63m in August 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko scored 21 goals in 45 games for Leipzig, including four goals in the Champions League. The centre-forward is one of the most sought-after strikers in European football, having thrived during his spells in Austria and Germany.",
      "Newcastle have welcomed winger Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for £55m and secured a loan move for goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale so far this summer. In terms of outgoings, the club have recouped some money through the sales of Lloyd Kelly and Sean Longstaff to Juventus and Leeds United, respectively.",

      "Defender Yoro knows United's rivals want to see them fail again, but said Ruben Amorim's players are determined to prove they are way better than last season's woeful showing.",

      "“But I understand, because we didn’t do really well, but this season will be different, I hope, for us. We don't need to listen to this and just be focused on ourselves. All of the players in the dressing-room have a lot of quality. I think we need to mix it together and try to do our best.”",

But the mindset of the team is to be ready for the first game, ready for the season. I think we are working and training for this, even in the game.”",
      "Yoro, 19, reckons United have the right blend of youth and experience and said players like him can benefit from the wisdom of older members like skipper Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Marcus Rashford has scored his first goal for Barcelona after finding the back of the net in their 5-0 win over Daegu in pre-season. Rashford joined Barcelona on loan last month, having been frozen out at Manchester United by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Barcelona do have a £26million option to buy the forward, with the deal finalised in time for Rashford to fly out for their pre-season tour of Asia. Rashford made his debut for the club in a 3-1 win over Vissel Kobe, where he suffered what is widely considered to be the biggest humiliation in football.",
      "The 27-year-old came off the bench at half-time and featured for 30 minutes before he was substituted himself. When asked about his decision to take Rashford off, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick explained: \"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury.\"",
      "Rashford also featured off the bench in a 6-3 win over FC Seoul on Thursday before netting his first goal for Barcelona against Daegu on Monday. Rashford once again came off the bench, replacing Robert Lewandowski at half-time, and he found the back of the net after latching on to a cross from Eric Garcia.",
      "Speaking ahead of the game, Rashford shared his ambitions for the new season, stating: \"It's been a good preseason and we're ready for the start of the season. I've integrated quite well and I'm adapting to the team and the coach.",
      "\"There are a lot of great players here, but I knew that before I came. The quality is very high and the intensity too, and that’s what we need to maintain throughout the season.\"",
      "When asked if he has a goal-scoring target, Rashford replied: \"As many as I can. I know it will be different for me to play in another country and in a different style of football, but I accept the challenge and will try to score as many goals as possible.\"",
      "Rashford is yet to be registered to play in La Liga this season due to Barcelona's financial woes, but the England international has insisted he is not concerned about the situation. \"I'm not worried about my registration,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it's something the club needs to resolve, and I'm confident it will happen. I'm focused on training and being ready for the start of the season.\"",
      "Rashford was part of a five-man 'bomb squad' at Old Trafford before his move to Barcelona and he is the only one of those five players who has left so far. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have also been frozen out and are expected to leave this summer.",

      "Manchester United are hoping for a clean slate this season after their disastrous 2024-25 campaign and it's been a case of so far, so good as far as this pre-season is concerned.",
      "Ruben Amorim has taken his players for a tour of the United States and they are yet to lose a game in pre-season, though the coach will primarily be focusing on the squad's fitness levels and how they are adapting to his tactics.",
      "United have wrapped up the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for big money fees and both players started against Everton on Sunday, though after a 2-2 draw it showed Amorim still has work to do on the best way to accommodate his new stars.",
      "The performance was probably United's worst of pre-season so far but Amorim's side certainly have shown signs of improvement since last season and they still have another friendly to come against Fiorentina before their huge Premier League opener against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "What United need from their captain is to be blunt and tell it like it is and that's exactly what they've got from Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal star was at risk of leaving after an approach from Saudi club Al-Hilal and fans will be grateful he decided to stay put - because he is exactly the kind of figure this team needs to get back to the level they desire.",
      "Even after a friendly game, Fernandes showed he wasn't happy with the performance and accused his team-mates of being \"lazy\" during the game - even though United ended up winning the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United twice relinquished the lead after Fernandes himself scored from the penalty spot before Mason Mount put the team back ahead in the second half - with Iliman Ndiaye and an Ayden Heaven goal pegging them back.",
      "\"It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,” Fernandes said. “It’s a game of football, there’s always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it’s normal, it is part of the game.",
      "\"It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players. We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that.\"",
      "Fernandes' bold and brutal comments will stand United in good stead for the season to come as it shows he won't stand for any more sloppiness for the team - something they cannot afford if they want to push on as a club.",
      "United only have two new signings so far and most supporters will tell you they needed arrivals from across the board given their woeful season. Despite being unbeaten in pre-season, it's been obvious this summer that United are crying out for more depth.",
      "Starting from the back of the team, it's clear United are lacking a new goalkeeper given Andre Onana's injury and question marks over his back-up Altay Bayindir, who is thought to want more regular game time.",
      "Onana has also come under fire for some high profile errors and United could really do with more competition in between the sticks, while the team could also do with more depth in defence and midfield - not to mention up front after the clear struggles in attack last season.",
      "Fernandes spoke about the need for more signings in his rant after the Everton game and said the team were crying out for more competition to help the players up their game.",
      "\"I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about,\" he said. \"I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko is just one of the players United are interested in and they have already opened talks with Red Bull Leipzig over his signature - but face stiff competition from Newcastle, who can offer him Champions League football.",
      "United lined up with Mbeumo and Cunha in attack against Everton as Amorim took a tactical gamble by playing a 3-4-1-2 formation, but neither player is an out-and-out centre-forward and prefer being out wide.",
      "The team will be deadly if they can get Mbeumo and Cunha either side of a clinical finisher like Sesko, who fired in 21 goals in all competitions last season and 18 in the season before. He is currently rated at £70m.",
      "United still have Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee at their disposal, but the later is currently injured and the former still has a long way to go in showing he is dependable.",
      "Hojlund did score in the 4-1 friendly win over Bournemouth and the fact he has been included in United's travelling group in the United States - and not left behind with \"the bomb squad\" of unwanted players - shows Amorim still has faith in him.",
      "Recent reports have claimed that Amorim believes the arrival of a top class striker like Sesko will bring out the best in Hojlund and force him to take his game to the next level.",
      "Having the two players in the team - alongside Mbeumo and Cunha and existing talent like Amad - can give United a new layer of firepower this season and that might be the difference to push the team up the table.",
      "Amorim has shown that once he falls out with a player, it is difficult to find a way back and it appears the ship has sailed with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho wasn't happy with his manager after he dropped him for the Europa League final and immediately suggested he wanted out of United - with the player subsequently left out of the club's pre-season tour.",
      "He has been strongly linked with a move to Aston Villa or Chelsea in this window and with a move yet to come to fruition, Amorim suggested that any United player who was currently frozen out had a chance of being reintegrated if they didn't find a new club.",
      "But his recent comments on Garnacho suggests there is no going back in their relationship after he claimed their relationship simply didn't work - and he could not put his finger on why.",
      "\"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said. \"And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Just like Fernandes, you want your manager to be a no-nonsense coach that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners.",
      "Amorim has raised eyebrows at Old Trafford with his candid statements on the team and brutal assessments about where they are at this moment in time. That's all fine, but those words have to be followed up with action on the pitch.",
      "He's already admitted this is the 'worst Manchester United team in history\" and recently said he knew his team would struggle in games last season, but luckily he is making moves to overhaul the squad to combat their woes.",
      "Amorim has isolated the players who he feels don't gel in his squad and aren't part of his plans - Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - while Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have left on free transfers.",
      "He's brought in two new signings and is plotting more - and revealed he was happy with the improvement he's seen from the team this summer so far.",
      "But his lengthy recent interview also set out his ambition and long-term plans for United after claiming he wanted to stay at Old Trafford for 20 years and follow in Sir Alex Ferguson's footsteps. It remains to be seen whether he can bring success to the club in the long term, but his attitude and bold steps he's taken certainly gives the team of chance of reaching that.",
      "\"I want to stay, I want to stay 20 [years],\" Amorim said. \"That is my goal and I truly believe in that. Something will happen. It always does. In some moments I will be lucky.",
      "\"I had a lot of luck during my career as a manager and my idea is to stay for many years. But again we know that the results will dictate that. I know that last season I used all the credits but I'm ready to start fresh.\"",

      "A move for a striker seems on the cards with Benjamin Sesko, also a target for the Magpies, being priority No. 1 for the Red Devils. Yet Nicholas, who played over 175 times for Arsenal, has lambasted the club for what he believes to be a sub-par recruitment round, questioning why the likes of Ramsdale were not looked at.",
      "\"There are a lot of players out there, a whole list who I think would be better than what Manchester United currently have,\" Nicholas exclaimed to Sky Bet. \"I just don't know where they see themselves going.\"",
      "Nicholas went on to raise questions about two players who have made moves this summer for fees that wouldn't break the bank: Norgaard, who arrived at the Emirates in July for £12m, and Ramsdale, who joined Newcastle on loan from Southampton last week.",
      "\"If I was Manchester United, why didn't they go in for Christian Norgaard? It looks as if they've waited for two high-profile players,\" continued Nicholas.",
      "\"But I look at them and I think, why are not adding more players like Norgaard, or players who have played well at Bournemouth and Newcastle, you could disrupt things and see who's interested.",
      "\"There are so many pillars I just can't understand, the whole lack of authority defensively and what is the current situation with the goalkeeper?",
      "\"Why don't they go and get Aaron Ramsdale? He's qualified, he knows the circuit, he's English, experienced, and competitive. I know Ramsdale hasn't won too much, but it's not far off what United have won.",
      "\"I just don't see how they see what an upgrade means. I don't see Manchester United fans showing one bit of excitement as it stands right now, and it's getting close for them to get aggressive towards the club again.\"",
      "Securing the services of a new star between the sticks is supposedly on the Old Trafford agenda this summer after Andre Onana suffered a substandard campaign last time out.",
      "Aston Villa No. 1 Emi Martinez looks destined to wave goodbye to Villa Park, but a United loan proposal for the Argentine was reportedly rejected last month. Head coach Amorim was asked about the prospect of signing a new goalkeeper before the window closes, and didn't rule the proposition out.",
      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim responded when asked if he hoped to bring in a new keeper or striker. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.\"",

      "United will be determined to bounce back from their woeful 15th-place finish last term and are eager to secure more signings before the transfer window shuts. However, Shearer has insisted that the club needs to bring in new players in two specific areas.",
      "\"Two good signings...they need at least another three, I would say,\" Shearer said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"They need a top-class centre-forward and goalkeeper.\"",
      "While Shearer commended United's recent acquisitions, Gary Lineker delivered a succinct five-word message to the recruitment team: \"They need a lot more. A lot more.\"",
      "It appears United may agree with Lineker and Shearer's assessments. The club are eyeing a move for RB Leipzig's sought-after striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old is also on Newcastle United's radar, with Leipzig reportedly demanding around £70m for the talented young forward.",
      "United are on the hunt for a new number nine to bolster their attacking options, despite Rasmus Hojlund's determination to keep his spot at Old Trafford. Sesko impressed last season with 21 goals and six assists in 45 appearances across all competitions, though Shearer has admitted that a move for striker would be a gamble.",
      "Shearer also suggested that United need to strengthen their goalkeeping options and it is an area of the team that has been the subject of speculation. The Sun have reported that United are searching for a new deputy to Andre Onana, with Antwerp's Senne Lammens emerging as a potential candidate.",
      "The implications of signing Lammens or another backup would likely impact Altay Bayindir's future at United. The 27-year-old joined the club from Fenerbahce, where he was captain, in 2023, but has since made only 11 appearances.",
      "On the field, United had reason to celebrate after clinching the Premier League Summer Series title following a 2-2 draw with Everton, adding to their victories over West Ham and Bournemouth. Post-match, captain Bruno Fernandes criticised the team for being \"a little bit lazy\", but Amorim had no qualms in supporting his captain's call for higher standards.",
      "\"It's saying that they understand the situation. So it's a good feeling. So tomorrow we are going to travel, one day off and we return to Carrington to work,\" Amorim said when asked about Fernandes' comments.",
      "\"Understanding that in this club everything is ups and downs. We understand that, but I prefer that feeling than the other side.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford is better than Nico Williams according to former Barcelona president, Joan Gaspart. The England international arrived at the Camp Nou on a season-long loan from Manchester United with a £26million option to buy earlier this summer, with his long-term future at Old Trafford far from certain.",
      "At 27 and in the prime of his playing career, Rashford will go down as one of the most impressive Manchester United academy graduates of all time, but that hasn't prevented him from falling out of favour with new boss, Ruben Amorim. Rashford was dropped by the Portuguese head coach midway through last season and subsequently went on loan to Aston Villa in February.",
      "With his future in the north west still up in the air, he has since joined Barcelona for the upcoming season. Rashford's journey to Catalonia was far from smooth sailing, however, with Barcelona seemingly favouring other top talents this summer before opting for the England international.",
      "Not only did Barcelona register an interest in Liverpool's Luis Diaz, only to be told that the Colombian wasn't for sale, but they also neared the completion of a deal for Athletic Club's Williams, which reportedly fell through at the eleventh hour due to a dispute with regards to a release clause and La Liga registration.",
      "Williams instead returned to Bilbao, before signing a 10-year extension which will see him at the Estadio de Sans Mames until 2035, while Barcelona landed Rashford on a temporary basis. And while many fans of the La Liga giants will be disappointed that they didn't sign Spain international Williams, Gaspart believes that Rashford is more talented than the 23-year-old left winger.",
      "Speaking to El 10 de Barca, Gaspart said: \"First of all, for me, Marcus Rashford is better than Nico. From here on, I don’t care what Inaki [Williams, Nico's brother] might say. The player has used us in a good way – he’s gotten a good contract, and I’m happy for him.",
      "\"I don’t understand Athletic’s anger. I’ve signed many players from Bilbao, and always got along with their president. This is in the past. We have to focus on the season and trust the squad and the exceptional coach we have.\"",
      "It comes as Inaki lambasted Barcelona for their handling of Williams' potential transfer, claiming that they orchestrated a \"media campaign\" to lure his younger brother away from Bilbao. He alleged: \"They launched a media campaign they thought would work. Many of the things said were lies. People weren’t fair to my brother this summer.\"",
      "He added: \"The external noise ruined a lot. At Athletic, we go about things quietly. We don’t leak false stories to pressure players,\" as well as: \"My brother had options everywhere. But he stayed. He’ll play with his family, friends, and girlfriend close by. That means more than money or trophies.\"",
      "Rashford made his unofficial debut for Barcelona in a pre-season friendly against Vissel Kobe last month. The Englishman entered the fray as a half-time substitute for Raphinha, but only graced the pitch for 30 minutes before he was substituted off.",
      "While the incident may have looked a little disrespectful from the outside looking in, manager Hansi Flick was quick to clear the air, explaining that it was a tactical decision to monitor the forward's fitness. He said after the 3-1 win: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball.",
      "\"He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has made clear his frustrations with Manchester United during their pre-season tour but not everyone has borne the brunt of the captain's criticism. Fernandes scored in a pre-season meeting with Everton, but United's issues were laid bare as David Moyes' side earned a 2-2 draw.",
      "United's skipped argued United were \"lazy\" during the draw in the United States, as an Ayden Heaven own goal ensured the spoils were shared. Fernandes' fellow scorer Mason Mount is still in his team-mate's good books, though, with the captain sharing a photo of the pair on Instagram with the simple caption: \"my guy\".",
      "“It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,” Fernandes said after the game against Everton. “It’s a game of football, there’s always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it’s normal, it is part of the game.",
      "“It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players. We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that,\" he added, suggesting a couple more new signings are still needed.",
      "“I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about. I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.\"",
      "The praise for Mount comes ahead of what could be a pivotal season for the England international. Since joining from Chelsea in 2023, he has struggled with a number of injury setbacks but showed towards the end of last season why United were willing to pay big money for him.",
      "In two seasons as a United player, Mount has played less than 2,000 competitive minutes. He's till just 26, though, and has time to turn his Old Trafford career around.",
      "Speaking during United's pre-season tour, Mount outlined the ways in which United are aiming to put last season's struggles behind them. Amorim's side ended last term in 15th place, missing out on Europe for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "“From day one of pre-season, it's about standards and details within training, on and off the pitch, and really focusing on what we need to do to be better and to perform better,\" the midfielder said. \"We haven't done loads of analysis of last season. We looked at a few areas that we can improve on, but this is a new season, it's like wiping the slate clean.",
      "\"Coming into this season with a different kind of attitude and a feeling about it and we're ready to go. The vibe around the group is very energetic. In training, it's been a few kicks here and there, because we want to win in games. That's what you want as a group. You kick your mate, but after training, it's all good.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are considering two potential solutions to a land battle that is threatening to delay their plans to build a new £2billion stadium. United unveiled their plans for a new ground back in March, with the club planning to demolish Old Trafford and build a brand new 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe hopes the project, which he has dubbed the 'Wembley of the North', will be completed by 2030 but they are struggling to buy a critical site beside the ground that is currently owned by freight company Freightliner.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, United believe the land is worth around £40million and they believe Freightliner are 'attempting to cash in with a significantly higher valuation'. As a result, United are looking into potential solutions to break the impasse.",
      "It is claimed a compulsory purchase order could be used to acquire the land, with United planning to regenerate the area surrounding the new stadium as well. The report also states that United could buy a portion of land so they can build the stadium and then acquire the rest.",
      "It is estimated the new stadium project will create up to 92,000 new jobs and more than 17,000 new homes, while it is hoped an additional 1.8 million visitors can be attracted.",
      "\"Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford,\" Ratcliffe said of the project.",
      "\"Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.",

      "Former Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson added: \" Manchester United should always strive for the best in everything it does, on and off the pitch, and that includes the stadium we play in.

      "This summer has already been a busy one when it comes to big-money transfers. As has often been the case, the Premier League has led the way, but English clubs might not be done just yet.",
      "Since the transfer window opened, teams in England's top-flight have spent big. We've already seen one move which could end up breaking the Premier League transfer record - Florian Wirtz's move from Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool - and that's just one of countless £50m+ deals across the country.",
      "Among those other deals are Liverpool's swoop for Hugo Ekitike, Arsenal's deal for Viktor Gyokeres and Manchester United's moves for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. We've also seen some notable overseas moves, with Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford among those to leave the Premier League.",
      "Liverpool have already broken the British transfer record once and they could be about to do it again. Isak is unlikely to be available for much less than £150million, but that figure could yet come down in the coming weeks - especially if Newcastle can find a replacement.",
      "Slovenia striker Sesko is one of Newcastle's options but they're not the only ones in the mix. Manchester United also remain keen on the frontman after seeing Viktor Gyokeres opt for Arsenal, and Sesko won't come cheap.",
      "Arsenal have already been busy, adding the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi and Noni Madueke. A move for Eze would wrap up a statement-making summer, while probably paving the way for Leandro Trossard to leave.",
      "Former Premier League star Lookman has thrived at Atalanta but feels his treatment in Bergamo has left plenty to be desired. The 27-year-old is expected to leave if a 'fair' offer arrives, having handed in a transfer request.",
      "In an emotional statement, Son confirmed he plans to leave Tottenham after a decade in North London. He appears to be Major League Soccer-bound, with LAFC ready to part with a club record £20m fee.",
      "Liverpool's summer of spending is also one with a fair few exits. Nunez looks likely to be next, with Al Hilal ready to swoop amid a lack of concrete interest from Europe.",
      "Chelsea paid Manchester United to get out of their obligation to sign Sancho after a loan, and the winger's parent club are braced for a financial hit. Juventus are ready to take a chance, though they may well need to trim their squad first.",
      "Brazil midfielder Douglas Luiz looks the most likely to leave Turin this summer. A return to the Premier League could solidify his hopes of playing at the 2026 World Cup, with Everton and Forest keen on the former Aston Villa man.",
      "England Under-21 star Elliott has long hoped to establish himself at Liverpool but now may need to move. West Ham had been linked, but Spurs could offer Champions League football and may need to recruit amid an injury concern over James Maddison.",

      "Rivaldo has warned Marcus Rashford he will not take Raphinha's starting spot in the Barcelona line-up this season. After yearning for a move to the La Liga giants all summer, Rashford finally got his dream switch last month, albeit on a season-long loan with a £26million option to buy.",
      "While Rashford will be remembered as one of United's great academy graduates, his tenure at Old Trafford looks all but finished while Ruben Amorim is at the helm. The 27-year-old fell out of favour under the Portuguese tactician midway through last season, subsequently being sent out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "With it clear that he was still no part of Amorim's plans upon his return earlier this summer, Rashford then began pushing for another move away from the club, with Barcelona ultimately securing his services after missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "While Rashford will be eager to hit the ground running in Spain, Rivaldo has warned that he will not start ahead of superstar Raphinha. Speaking to Betfair, the 53-year-old, who played for Barcelona between 1997 and 2002, said: \"I think that’s highly unlikely that Rashford will take Raphinha’s spot, especially after the season Raphinha had last year.",
      "\"In my view, Raphinha is currently among the top five players in the world. Right now, he’s an undisputed starter at Barca and already a club icon. Everyone, the players, the coaching staff, the whole club rates him very highly.",
      "\"What he did last season was outstanding, so without a doubt, that position is his. Of course, it’s always good to have top-quality players around you.",
      "\"So yes, there will be competition, but I don’t think Rashford is going to take Raphinha’s place. Other opportunities will arise, and with training, the manager will likely find a way to fit them both into the team. But for me, Raphinha is a nailed-on starter. I don’t see any chance of him being dropped from Barca’s starting line-up.\"",
      "Rivaldo also explained Rashford may have to be patient for his opportunity, and he may find himself starting off the bench as the season gets underway. He added: \"When a player leaves a club in a tough situation, like he did, and joins a team like Barcelona, it’s only natural that the coach will use training sessions and the first few matches to get a better look at him.",
      "\"Barcelona had a great season last year, so it’s normal for him to start off on the bench. I believe that little by little, he’ll find his rhythm, start to understand how the manager wants the team to play, get used to the training routines, and gradually settle in.",
      "\"Over time, he’ll earn his spot. He’s a hugely talented player – he’s already proven that in one of the toughest leagues in the world. He’s also an international. So, I fully expect him to earn a place in Barca’s starting eleven and re-establish himself as a regular in the England squad too.\"",
      "With 34 goals and 25 assists to his name across all competitions last season, Raphinha was instrumental to Barcelona clinching the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de España. And under contract until 2028, it is thought that the 28-year-old Brazilian will retain his place in Hansi Flick's starting XI in the fresh campaign.",
      "Rashford made his unofficial Barcelona debut in a pre-season friendly against Vissel Kobe last month, coming on as a substitute for Raphinha at half time. However, he lasted just 30 minutes before he was replaced by Pedro Fernandez Sarmiento.",
      "While the incident came across as somewhat embarrassing for Rashford, Flick was quick to explain that the move was to manage his fitness. After the match, he said: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball. He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford returned to the fray on Thursday for Barcelona's 7-3 drubbing of FC Seoul, once again coming on for the second half as a replacement for Raphinha. However, on that occasion, he lasted the full 45 minutes, even assisting Ferran Torres' 88th-minute strike to cap off the victory.",

      "Three games, two wins, one draw, eight goals and one trophy marked a positive pre-season tour for Manchester United as they won the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.",
      "Beyond the results and performances, United have looked fitter than at this stage in recent years, the manager is secure and no clouds are hovering over the squad.",
      "United's schedule was more streamlined and Chicago was a perfect base. The Endeavor Health Performance Center they trained at only opened this year and the players could socialise in a superb city with next-to-no hassle.",
      "The past fortnight has provided a promising platform for a successful season. With the transfer window open for four more weeks, United are certain to be active with incomings and outgoings and there are unaddressed issues that were apparent before they took off for Chicago.",
      "Here are five talking points from their tour:",
      "Bruno Fernandes, typically, was one of three players to start all three tour games and scored three goals. Fernandes ended the match against Everton in midfield, where he started against Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "Fernandes will flitter between the No.10 and the No.8 over the course of the season as United have a surfeit of options to play behind the striker. Even when Matheus Cunha operated as the false nine against Everton, Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Mason Mount had stints as one of the 10s.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another option as Amorim ponders how to enhance a midfield arguably as in urgent need of an upgrade as up front. Whenever Fernandes eventually departs United, they are not going to require a playmaker for a while.",
      "United's intention to loan out Toby Collyer all but confirms a midfield recruit is lined up. Amorim criticised the \"lack of pace\" in the area after the goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and he hooked Mainoo before the hour mark against Everton.",
      "The bigger issue in the 2-2 draw was Manuel Ugarte, who was stuck against the Toffees. Everton preyed on Ugarte's limitations and he wilted against an aggressive press. Ugarte sought protection from the referee and when he attempted to match Everton's physicality he committed an obvious foul.",
      "Casemiro is undeniably a squad player and not even in the new six-man leadership group, having been a part of it under Erik ten Hag. Collyer's three career starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One. Amorim has belief in Mainoo but seems caught between two stools as to his role.",
      "Amorim suggested he was \"happy\" that United underperformed against Everton, easily the least accomplished of their performances, as the players would not be lulled into a false sense of security back at Carrington. This has been a buoyant United tour but the midfield has to be improved.",
      "United's second-best player last season was another playmaker and Amad started behind Rasmus Hojlund in Chicago. In the other two games, he was on the right wing and that appears to be the role Amorim has settled on for him.",
      "Amorim had Geovany Quenda to service Viktor Gyokeres in his final months at Sporting and Amad is a similar profile: a young left-footed winger expected to assume defensive responsibilities whilst offering attacking intent down the right-hand side.",
      "With £133.5million worth of new forwards and the totemic Fernandes in the attacking trident against Everton, United had dexterous playmakers to drop deep and spring through Amad, playing on the shoulder of the last defender. It led to a chance for Cunha and the penalty that Fernandes converted.",
      "Amad played on the wing in Amorim's first United match in charge at Ipswich. Four other wingers are in the bomb squad, either unwilling or incapable of meeting Amorim's demands.",
      "Another 'hidden' attacking asset is Leny Yoro, who is literally stepping up and playing more on the front foot.",
      "One of the last kicks from Rasmus Hojlund in the States was his boot against the post. He was appalled that Patrick Dorgu had shot at goal rather than gone across goal.",
      "Dorgu was well within his rights to shoot. Hojlund may have strayed offside, too. We have become accustomed to that reaction from Hojlund and he vented at Diogo Dalot in Stockholm a little over two weeks ago.",
      "It cannot be easy for Hojlund to continue as United's No.9 when they are enquiring about almost any attainable striker. He is in an identical position to Erik ten Hag last year when United asked every Tom, Dick and Harry if they would take over as manager. Ten Hag remained in situ after the head-hunting but was eventually summoned to the guillotine.",
      "Hojlund is digging his heels in amid United's efforts to flog him but it is unsustainable and could jeopardise the squad harmony. Hojlund was socialising with Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as recently as United's penultimate night in Chicago. United need to be transparent with the Dane.",
      "This has been the most upbeat United pre-season since 2017. The quirk of that is United entered that summer having just won the Europa League final.",
      "Denying the 'bomb squad' members a seat on the plane to Chicago has indubitably helped. The players have publicly backed Amorim's handling of players who have caused him and the club problems. United are not treading on eggshells with Marcus Rashford any more after he was whisked away to Barcelona.",
      "Ten Hag had Jadon Sancho foisted onto him for pre-season last year and his working relationship with Rashford was practically irreparable. Senior figures at United want to provide unequivocal backing for Amorim and his authority is yet to be challenged over his handling of a player.",

      "Andre Onana is expected to be match-fit for the Arsenal fixture but if he isn't then a 39-year-old deserves to be between the sticks for United.",
      "This tour was additional evidence that Altay Bayindir is the third-best of United's senior 'keepers. In a summer where United are exploring the possibility of recruiting a new goalie, it is peculiar that they are not actively looking to shift Bayindir, whose reputation hinges on a couple of penalty saves in a cup tie.",
      "Bayindir was utterly unconvincing again in the draw with Everton whereas Tom Heaton kept competently against Bournemouth. Onana has to demonstrate clear evidence that he has honed his technique when he does return and the first-choice goalkeeper position can be parked for a year.",

      "Old Trafford or St James' Park? That is the question facing Benjamin Sesko right now.",
      "With just under four weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, the RB Leipzig striker finds himself at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "Both clubs are determined to strengthen their respective forward lines ahead of the September 1 deadline and Sesko has emerged as a leading target for the pair of them.",
      "After finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer.",
      "They have brought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively, but they are still missing the most importance piece of the jigsaw in the form of a recognised centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who United are open to selling for £30million, regressed last season, scoring just ten goals in all competitions. Fellow attacker Joshua Zirkzee, who arrived from Bologna last summer, scored seven goals and is not a centre-forward.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap in early-June, United have since been chasing shadows in their striker search. However, it was never unrealistic to suggest sourcing their most important signing could take the most amount of time.",
      "Right now, Sesko occupies top spot on United's wish list. However, unlike Newcastle, they are yet to table a formal offer for the Slovenian international, who scored 21 goals for Leipzig last season.",
      "United do not want to get drawn into a bidding war for the striker, and understandably so, and it is believed they want assurances from Sesko that he wants to move to Old Trafford before potentially making an opening offer.",
      "Despite already spending more than £130m this summer, United are confident of financing a deal for Sesko before overseeing sales. United expect to save £14m this season on Marcus Rashford's wages, they have banked £5m from Chelsea's decision not to sign Jadon Sancho permanently and have raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses inserted in previous sales.",
      "In a better financial position than what was originally anticipated at the start of the window, United have resources available to them to sign Sesko. But is he worth the fee Leipzig are demanding?",
      "As with any transfer pursuit, United's interest in Sesko has split opinion. Many recognise his high ceiling and potential, and also acknowledge his respectable goalscoring record in Germany and Austria, but can United afford to take such a big risk at this moment in time?",
      "On one hand, supporters are within their rights to say yes, acknowledging the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, of which 35 were scored in the Premier League. On the flip side, others believe United should go for somebody who is more established and proven, no doubt mindful of the gamble United took on Hojlund two years ago.",
      "Last week, it was confirmed Ollie Watkins had also made his way onto United's list of options, but Aston Villa are currently refusing to sell him. He has three years left on his contract and scored 16 Premier League goals last season.",
      "However, if United are capable of throwing big-money at Leipzig in an attempt to sign Sesko, they will almost certainly have the funds available to try and change Villa's stance.",
      "Watkins is seven years Sesko's senior, meaning his ceiling is not as high, but what he does boast is a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Despite never scoring 20 goals or more in a Premier League campaign, the England international has reached double figures in each of the last five seasons since joining Villa in 2020, scoring 75 league goals. He has plundered 87 goals in all competitions for Villa.",
      "At 29, Watkins is not necessarily as attractive a signing as what Sesko would be, but there is a stronger likelihood of him coming in and hitting the ground running. He has scored 35 Premier League goals in the last two seasons, assisting 21.",
      "Having already swooped for two of the Premier League's best players in Mbeumo and Cunha this summer, Watkins would be a fitting addition to come in and spearhead United's attack.",
      "Sesko currently sits at the top of the wish list, but it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to Watkins and his record.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United defender Leny Yoro has been one of the biggest 'winners' of pre-season this summer.",
      "Yoro has impressed in each of his appearances in Stockholm, New Jersey, Chicago and Atlanta, and supporters are excited about what he could achieve with a clean bill of health this season.",
      "The Frenchman's first 12 months in Manchester were disrupted by injuries - and he still made a strong impression. There were clear signs of Yoro's potential in the midst of a hugely challenging season for United and this summer's evidence suggests he is ready to take further steps forward in 2025/2026.",
      "Yoro, 19, is learning on the job and already has the qualities of a top player, which helps to explain why Real Madrid were interested in signing him before his transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Attracting interest from Real Madrid speaks volumes and they were in the race to sign Yoro. However, United submitted a financial package - €62million (£51.8m), with an additional €8m (£6.6m) in add-ons - that Madrid were not prepared to match, as Yoro was in the final year of his Lille contract.",
      "Some suggested United were foolish for paying a significant fee when Yoro's deal was approaching its expiry, but sitting on their hands would have opened the door for Real Madrid to sign him on a free transfer this summer.",
      "United considered Yoro worth the investment and he could make the £51.8m outlay look like value in the coming years. Yoro has the skillset to become world-class and world-class players command much higher fees.",
      "One of the most promising aspects of Yoro's pre-season performances has been his willingness to play out from the back because his passing range is hugely beneficial to build-up play.",
      "It's something Ruben Amorim wants from Yoro, too. \"The coach asked me to do, so I need to do it. I enjoy doing it, being in front, and If I can bring the ball forward then I will do it,\" he said after the Everton draw.",
      "When Yoro made his United debut against Rangers at Murrayfield in Scotland in pre-season last summer, he executed a few sublime passes, leading to jokes that he was a future Ballon d'Or winner.",
      "Those types of passes aren't easy to execute and they were briefly missing from Yoro's locker when he returned from a metatarsal injury in December, but he gradually grew in confidence.",
      "Yoro now looks completely relaxed as a United player and it's exciting to see him pick out long passes again - defenders who can play such passes are a manager's dream to deal with.",
      "Before picking up an ankle injury against West Ham in May, which almost ended Yoro's hopes of playing in the Europa League final, he was outstanding in the left-sided centre-back role.",
      "Most suspected Yoro would be nailed to start in that position in the back-three at the start of the new season, but Amorim has deployed him on the opposite side this summer.",
      "Yoro played on the right side of the defence against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the States, and his performances on that side were just as good as those previously produced on the left.",
      "With that in mind, Yoro deserves praise for delivering strong displays on both sides of the back-three. Possessing the skill to be versatile is another string to his bow as he develops.",
      "Real Madrid would have loved to sign Yoro, but they weren't willing to cough up a decent transfer fee for a player in the final year of his contract. And that caution forced them to miss out on a supremely talented young defender.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "And while it is a trophy that pales into scant insignificance to the many major honours United have won in their rich history, Ruben Amorim may look back on this last fortnight as a major milestone in his reign.",
      "It has been far from plain sailing for the Portuguese since he inherited the Old Trafford hotseat in November last year and he has had to endure some turbulence in his opening months as manager.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last term and only managed two Premier League wins in 2025 against teams who weren't relegated to the Championship.",
      "They also missed out on European football this season when they were beaten 1-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao back in May.",
      "United's board have stuck by Amorim, though, and have backed him in the transfer market with the signings of forwards Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "A new centre-forward is on the wishlist, too, as well as a new midfielder. The belief is that the short term pain United have endured will benefit them in the long run - particularly with a full pre-season working under the former Sporting manager.",
      "And the early evidence has been positive. While there was some negativity around the draw with Everton, wins against Bournemouth and West Ham - two teams who turned over United so easily last season - felt significant.",
      "United's players have repeatedly spoken about how they feel they are getting to grips more with Amorim's methods. If that is the case, and United are able to beat the teams they should be beating - something they struggled to do last season - there could be reason to be positive about their prospects this term.",

      "Man United have been in talks with Leipzig over a potential move and the fee they would be prepared to pay. Newcastle, meanwhile, are also in negotiations over the structure of the deal.",
      "Sesko, who scored 21 goals in 45 appearances last season, is open to a move to both projects but it's reported that he is leaning towards Man United if they can agree a deal.",
      "Manchester United's pursuit of a new striker in the transfer market remains their number one priority this summer.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana hopes to return for the start of the new Premier League season after missing all pre-season games to date. Onana sustained a hamstring injury in the first week of training last month.",
      "This setback led head coach Ruben Amorim to use both Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton in goal during their three-match tour of the USA, which wrapped up on Sunday. Despite not being at their sharpest, United managed a 2-2 draw with Everton in Atlanta, Georgia, securing the Premier League Summer Series title.",
      "However, as United gear up for their season opener against Arsenal on Sunday, August 17, Onana may still be absent, although he reports feeling 'great' ahead of their last pre-season match against Fiorentina on Saturday.",

      "Who needs to win the Europa League when you can win the Premier League Summer Series?",
      "Manchester United lifted a trophy at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday evening after beating West Ham and Bournemouth, and drawing against Everton, during the United States tour.",
      "The 'celebrations' were obviously muted, but the vibes around United at the end of the pre-season tour are undeniably better compared to the mood in the days building up to the trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for an initial £65million, announced a day before the flight to the USA, was the catalyst for a more optimistic outlook. It was important to sign Mbeumo in time to travel to the States, and there have been green shoots elsewhere in the friendlies.",
      "United have looked fitter, well-organised and capable of hurting their opponent in the final third. The players were handed individual fitness regimes during their holiday this summer and it seems to have paid off.",
      "Ruben Amorim's decision to exile players who had fallen below expectations has also seemed to pay off, with the players on the USA tour discussing the improved culture and morale in the dressing room.",
      "Amorim has banished the bad eggs. There is a feeling of harmony within the group and the players have seemed notably upbeat during sessions at the Endeavor Health Performance Centre.",
      "The performances themselves have been better. United cruised to victories against West Ham and Bournemouth, although the draw against Everton in the final game was a reminder that there is further work to do.",
      "For all the positivity on tour, some of the old problems remain, particularly in midfield, which is an area that Amorim needs to strengthen before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "United struggled with Everton's physicality in midfield and will struggle throughout the campaign if a fresh face is not added. Amorim also needs to sign a striker, potentially Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Speaking during half-time against Everton, Berrada spoke about transfers and promised that club officials are working long hours to ensure Amorim's squad receives additional reinforcements.",
      "“We have to do a lot of multitasking,\" he said. \"We have a team back home led by Jason, the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it.”",
      "Berrada continued: “The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We have very high standards, Ruben is very clear about that and so is Jason [Wilcox]. It is something we want to see with the players, with the staff, with everyone, because what we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",
      "“Of course, adding players helps. We have seen the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. They have adapted really well.",
      "\"We are going to see Bryan play for the first time, Matheus has already shown his quality and Diego has shown that he is adapting very quickly, having just come from Paraguay, so all of the signs are positive and we are cautiously optimistic. We hope we are going to have a great season.”",
      "Berrada also said the right things during another brief interview to MUTV on the money-spinning post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong in May.",
      "Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha should prove to be tremendous signings, but more high-quality additions are required to get United into a position to challenge for European football.",
      "Amorim said United \"need to return to Europe\" during his captivating chat with journalists on tour. United need to sign a midfielder and a striker to have a chance of achieving that goal this season.",
      "The mood has improved at Old Trafford, but there is still work to do before deadline day.",

      "Manchester United could finally be about to find a solution to Ruben Amorim's long-winded search for a new striker this summer. United have missed out on two of their targets this window with Liam Delap joining Chelsea and Viktor Gyokeres moving to Arsenal.",
      "The Reds' poor end to last season has left Amorim's options short with no European football to offer. After signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo earlier in the window, United are now prioritising a new centre-forward.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is at the top of their list after the 22-year-old was snubbed by Arsenal. However, United aren't alone with Newcastle pushing hard to strike an agreement with RB Leipzig to sign the striker.",
      "A club-record deal worth at least £70million has been put on the table by Eddie Howe's men but it remains unknown what Sesko's official preference is. It's been widely reported that the Magpies are keen to get the deal concluded before the Premier League starts next weekend.",
      "United are believed to be keen on signing the Slovenia international but as of right now, they are yet to submit a formal bid. Should Sesko move to Newcastle and Amorim miss out on a striker for the third time, the club will be forced to look at Plan D or even Plan E.",
      "Ollie Watkins is, on paper, the next best option with the Aston Villa centre-forward boasting an impressive goalscoring record. The England international is understood to be available for transfer this summer with Unai Emery said to be willing to sell him.",
      "The Mirror have claimed that Watkins could be sold in order for Villa to sign Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea. That has been followed by The Athletic, who have reported that Chelsea would be open to letting him depart if the right deal emerges.",
      "It may not be the circumstance that United want to be in but it largely comes down to their poor performance last season. It remains to be seen whether they can afford Sesko, but if Newcastle win the race, United could benefit from the Jackson and Watkins domino effect.",
      "If Villa are willing to sell Watkins to bring in Jackson, the England international surely has to be bought. United know they can't go into the new season without another striker and the longer the window goes, the more every club will become desperate.",
      "Should Jackson be available for Villa and Emery push for it, the green light is there for Watkins. Signing the 29-year-old is less of a risk for United than Sesko due to his Premier League experience and it is highly likely to be a cheaper package to construct.",

      "\"It was a tough time in my career, but they’re the moments that either make you or break you,\" was Marcus Rashford's admission regarding his time playing under former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho.",
      "While he admitted that his style of coaching was not conducive to good performances from the winger, Rashford felt that he learnt different qualities of perseverence under the Portuguese head coach. The next time that the United academy graduate was managed by someone from that part of Europe, his career at the club came to an end.",
      "While Ruben Amorim and Mourinho's nationalities are merely coincidental, the two men do share similarities when it comes to their man-management. Rashford's association with United may not have ended altogether yet but his loan move to Barcelona is the beginning of the end.",
      "In Catalonia, it appears they have a tailored plan in mind for Rashford which Mourinho is unlikely to agree with. Speaking on Monday after Rashford scored his first goal for Barca in a 5-0 victory over Daegu FC, his new head coach Hansi Flick explained his thoughts on where the United man shall be utilised.",
      "\"Rashford can play as a No. 9 [like Robert Lewandowski], and as a No.11 [like Raphinha],\" Flick explained. \"We put him [Rashford] in the centre today because Ferran Torres was injured.\"",
      "\"I always thought it was better for him to come from the side, especially the left side.\" This move to Barcelona is clearly a big final chance for Rashford who will know that if he does not perform, not only is his place at the World Cup next summer in doubt, but so is a permanent move to the La Liga giants.",
      "It seems if he is going to impress Thomas Tuchel and Flick, he will need to prove Mourinho wrong in the process.",

      "Newcastle United may have made the first move in the race to sign 22-year-old striker Benjamin Sesko, but Manchester United could reportedly use the selling club's desire for Rasmus Hojlund as a makeweight in a potential deal.",
      "United's summer transfer window has been all about improving their attack, after a miserable season in front of goal. Rising star Sesko from RB Leipzig fits the bill, but the Magpies have stolen a march on Ruben Amorim's side, submitting a bid of around £78 million.",
      "The Reds are yet to follow up their interest with a bid, with journalist Fabrizio Romano saying that they will advance their plans if they can get a firm answer from Sesko that he would like to join the club. It has been reported that Leipzig are interested in taking on Hojlund on loan if there is a deal to be done at Old Trafford, which could grease the wheels if United commit to the transfer.",
      "Hojlund himself is set on staying at Manchester United however, and he has repeatedly said that he is ready to fight for his place in the squad, whatever happens next. Improvements to the attack in the 10 positions, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joining the club, could benefit him over the course of the upcoming season.",
      "Commenter Cromwellswart says: \"By selling Hojlund and buying Sesko or whoever it maybe, we're simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. We can't just have Chido playing second fiddle to Sesko. It's clear we need Hojlund and a new striker, or we buy two new strikers. And I'm starting to get the feeling that I'd rather we kept Hojlund and looked elsewhere, than sell him to buy Sesko. Hojlund deserves another shot in this team.\"",
      "Realperson writes: \"We could do with Sesko and Hojlund competing for the striker role. Last season Hojlund was poor and lacking in confidence for most of it. He’s shown in his first season and in this preseason that he can play. Sesko would be new to the Premier League. I wouldn’t trust either to play every game well. Obi is young and developing. Zirkzee is a support striker and should be competing with Cunha and Mbuemo.\"",
      "A_grace says: \"A forward, a good defensive midfielder with pace and a new goalkeeper to replace Altay are definitely needed and every player must lift their game if Utd want to qualify for Europe this season. Hojlund should be kept to support the new striker.\"",
      "Others say that Hojlund does not have a future with the club if Sesko joins. Tt84 says: \"It seems like the players do not trust Hojlund, which I think means he has to go. I thought he did alright over the pre-season but that's only from what I read.\"",
      "LesJohnson writes: \"Amorim does not trust Hojlund, that is obvious, and is waiting for Zirkzee to get fit and play that vital link role up front.\"",
      "Bluecheetahs says: \"As much as I'd like him to stay and fight for his place, I truly believe a loan move to Leipzig (with Sesko coming to us) would be the best for this lad's career. I'd prefer Zirkzee as cover for Sesko... and dont forget Cunha and Mbeumo can both play as a striker.\"",

The group has been assembled by Amorim to deal with issues that directly impact the players.",

      "United suffered their worst season in 51 years last term and failed to qualify for Europe for only the second time in the past 35 years.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is targeting European qualification, at the very minimum, and United have enjoyed a propitious pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "United won two and drew one of their three Premier League Summer Series matches to win the competition and the 19-year-old Yoro is feeling bullish about their prospects for the new campaign.",
      "\"There are a lot of people that want us to fail and we know that,\" Yoro said. \"But there are also a lot of people that want us to do it, to do great things.",
      "\"We just focus on the fans, you know. We don't care about what they say outside, about the media. Everyone said bulls**t about us last year. But I understand because we didn’t do really well.",
      "\"But this season will be different, I hope for us. We don't need to listen to this and just be focused on ourselves. When you play for Manchester United, you need to have the mindset of being the best version of yourself.",
      "\"I think what they did last season was a mistake for us. When you're Manchester United, you cannot be at this position. The fans know it, everyone knows it. I think we understand this.",
      "\"This season will be different for us. It will be like a revenge from last season. We need to do better.\"",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes described aspects of United's performance in the 2-2 draw with Everton as \"lazy\". Everton came from behind twice to deny United three straight victories in Atlanta on Sunday night.",
      "Amorim suggested the issues with the performance could benefit the players as they will not be lulled into a false sense of security when they return to their Carrington training complex.",
      "\"I would not say disappointed because we did a good tour,\" Yoro added of the result. \"We arrived first. This is good. We didn't lose. We know we can do better. But still the pre-season, there are still some things to improve. I think we can be happy with what we did during this tour.",
      "\"Of course, this last game can be different. But it's still good for us to have this type of game to improve.\"",

      "Manchester United winger Antony has sent a message to Diogo Dalot after the full-back's time in the USA for the Reds' pre-season tour came to an end.",
      "United's trip in the States came to an end overnight following the 2-2 draw with Everton in Atlanta, Georgia. Despite being pegged back twice by the Toffees, the Reds finished their stint in the US having remained unbeaten and lifted the Premier League Summer Series trophy in the process.",
      "Following the fixture, United have flown back to the UK to readjust ahead of Saturday's final pre-season clash against Fiorentina at Old Trafford. Bidding farewell to America, Dalot took to Instagram to share highlights from the tour.",
      "In the comments, Brazilian forward Antony replied with a couple of clapping emojis and a red love heart. The gesture towards his current teammate comes after the winger was not included in Ruben Amorim's squad for the trip overseas.",
      "At the beginning of pre-season, Antony was one of five players who told the club that they wished to leave to explore other options. The winger, along with Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia, were given extended breaks from the first-team as per their wishes to pursue moves elsewhere.",
      "Only Rashford has managed to find himself a new club having joined Barcelona on loan for the season. The quartet, including Antony, have yet to find moves and Amorim has already claimed that a time will come when they will have to be reintegrated into the first-team squad.",
      "In Antony's case, he has been heavily linked with a move to Real Betis, who he spent the second half of last season on loan with. The winger is believed to be keen to reunite with the Seville club but the Reds want to sell him permanently and that is not something that Betis' finances will allow.",
      "While the Reds have been away, Antony has remained in Manchester and it remains to be seen if or when he is reintegrated into the United team.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is reportedly considering several \"very important\" factors as he takes his time deciding between Manchester United and Newcastle United this summer.",
      "But complicating matters is the presence of Newcastle, who similarly hold a desperate desire to add firepower to their squad before the season begins.",
      "The Magpies have reportedly taken their interest further than United to date with a €75million (£65.5million) up-front bid plus a further €5million (£4.3million) in add-ons rejected by Leipzig.",
      "There's been no hint as to which of the two clubs Sesko prefers and, according to the latest report from Fabrizio Romano, that decision has not actually been reached yet.",
      "The 22-year-old - who has scored 39 goals in two seasons in Germany - is dwelling over five key elements of the transfer before naming Old Trafford or St. James' Park as his preference.",
      "First, Sesko is said to be taking a broader assessment of the Premier League switch, considering which would be better for his career and life as a whole.",
      "The striker knows what it means to move away from family having left Slovenia for RB Salzburg, as a 16-year-old, but in this latest move must think about what is best for himself and those closest to him.",
      "Following on are different footballing aspects of a potential move.",
      "One is the offer of European football, which United can't give in the 2025/26 campaign as they did not do enough to qualify. The last time the club was in the Champions League was 2023/24, and it will be their ambition to return and then stay there.",
      "Newcastle have qualified for the Champions League in two of the three most recent campaigns.",
      "Bleeding into this are the projects each club are undertaking to establish themselves high in the ranks of English and European competition - as well as the coaches at either club. Ruben Amorim and Eddie Howe have different mentalities that will require thinking about.",
      "And, lastly, it's explained Sesko will consider the money United and Newcastle are willing to offer him.",

      "Manchester United target Morten Hjulmund has already has made his feelings clear on Ruben Amorim, having worked with him at Sporting CP. The Denmark international has been linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer, as the Reds attempt to strengthen in midfield.",
      "Hjulmand, 26, signed for Sporting from Lecce for £15.8million in August 2023 and has impressed since his move to Lisbon. The ex-Admira Wacker man helped Amorim's side win the Primeira Liga in his first season in Portugal and he followed that up with another league title triumph in the last campaign.",
      "His performances have caught the eye of several clubs across Europe, including Juventus, Manchester City and Tottenham. However, United are determined to win the race for his signature. Indeed, the Reds sent a £34m bid to Sporting for Hjulmand last Monday, according to Calciomercato.",
      "Amorim, who left Sporting to replace Erik ten Hag as United's new permanent head coach in November, is said to be keen on reuniting with Hjulmand at Old Trafford. The midfielder has a £68m release clause in his Sporting contract but his valuation is expected to be much less than that figure.",
      "Should Hjulmand make the move to United, he would work alongside Amorim again and that is something that the Sporting man wouldn't appear to be against. Speaking after Amorim decided to join United, Hjulmand heaped praise on the Portuguese and admitted he was \"sad\" at the decision.",
      "\"It was also difficult for me to hear,\" Hjulmand admitted at the time. \"I was sad that Ruben is leaving me and leaving Sporting. It is a great opportunity. I hope that Ruben is proud of himself for getting an offer like this.\"",
      "\"Of course, Ruben was one of the reasons why I came to Sporting,\" Hjulmand added. \"When you work with Ruben you see a clear picture. That was important when I joined Sporting – first to understand how he plays.",
      "\"The way that he manages the team inside the pitch and outside the pitch as well is not like I anything I have seen in my short career. I think Manchester [United] are in good hands with Ruben.\"",
      "It's clear that Hjulmand would be open to reuniting with Amorim at United and he would be an astute addition. Clearly knows the system inside out and wouldn't take him long to bed into his approach.",

      "Man Utd will ‘end up’ signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko this summer despite Newcastle’s latest bid, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are desperate to sign a new striker this summer after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed just seven Premier League goals between them last campaign.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term and now INEOS have made Sesko their priority centre-forward target.",
      "However, Man Utd face top competition from Newcastle, in fact the Geordies are the only side currently negotiating a fee with RB Leipzig.",
      "It was revealed on Monday evening that Newcastle had made a new offer worth €90m in order to try and satisfy the Bundesliga club’s demands for Sesko.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano wrote on X: ‘Newcastle have sent official bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Šeško worth €90m package. €80m plus €10m add-ons on the table from #NUFC. No decision yet from the player.",
      "READ: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "‘Manchester United confirmed again to RB Leipzig that they will bid if Šeško picks them.’",
      "Another journalist, Sacha Tavolieri, has revealed that Leipzig are ‘expected to accept’ the new offer from Newcastle with Man Utd still yet to make their first bid.",
      "Tavolieri also added on X: ‘EXCL – RB Leipzig now expected to accept €90M deal for Šeško !",
      "‘Newcastle expected to reach a full agreement with RB Leipzig soon. #NUFC now waiting for RBL final approval.",
      "‘As revealed on 2/08 at midnight, Benjamin Šeško decision is to join the Magpies.’",
      "But football finance expert Stefan Borson has predicted that Man Utd will end up signing Sesko and hoping they can offload Hojlund before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “Newcastle now are going to be in a position where because they’ve missed out on so many players, are they going to be pressured into overpaying or overpromising for a player like Sesko?",
      "“It’s going to be interesting to see. It’s almost impossible to know whether it’s a good price or not. If he works, you’ve got a striker for 10 years, and if he fails, then it’s just another £65million down the tube.",
      "“What could United get for Hojlund? Maybe half the money back, and that’s the nature of these transfers. I don’t think the fee itself is going to put anybody off.",
      "“I think it’s more United will just be looking at it and going can we sell before we buy ideally and, if not, then are we prepared to invest another £65million, with maybe £30million down, and the wages are obviously going to be significant for this player.",
      "“So, it becomes a financial decision.",
      "“I would think United probably end up with him and kind of just cave in timing-wise, just taking the decision to buy him and hoping that they can sell towards the end of the window.”",
      "Man Utd are looking to recoup around £30m for Hojlund this summer with Caught Offside revealing on Monday that former Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag is ‘pushing hard’ to take the Dane to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Speaking on his future after a recent pre-season win over Bournemouth, Hojlund told reporters: “I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused, and then obviously we’ll see what happens.",
      "“I think my plan is very clear, and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.”",
      "Hojlund added: “I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Now it’s just about for me to sharpen myself, and I’ve done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",
      "Man Utd have put their ‘first offer’ on the table for Benjamin Sesko as they battle Newcastle for the RB Leipzig striker, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is now ‘leaning towards’ one club as Man Utd and Newcastle fight it out over the RB Leipzig striker, according to reports.",
      "Newcastle United are now reportedly ready to sell Alexander Isak to Liverpool this summer with the Swede’s agent having given an update on his future.",
      "Man Utd have been ‘offered’ two alternatives to Benjamin Sesko with RB Leipzig set to accept Newcastle’s latest offer for the striker, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United are ‘expected’ to reach a ‘full agreement’ with RB Leipzig over Benjamin Sesko amid interest from Man Utd.",
      "An August striker domino effect across Europe will begin when Benjamin Sesko joins Newcastle, with Alexander Isak and Ollie Watkins also involved."

      "Former Sheffield United striker Jan Aage Fjortoft, who now works in the media in for Viaplay and ESPN, has claimed that ‘two things must happen’ for Man Utd to get a deal over the line.",
      "Fjortoft wrote on X: ‘Re: Sesko I fully respect Manchester United’s stance in saying, “We only want players who genuinely want to play for us.” That principle is admirable and important for building the right culture.",
      "‘However, the current situation with RB Leipzig highlights the challenge of that strategy in the real market. Newcastle have made a strong bid, reportedly €80m plus €10m in add-ons, putting pressure on any competing club.",
      "‘As the selling club, RB Leipzig’s objective is straightforward: to secure the best possible deal. For Manchester United, this means two things must happen: a) Convince the player that United is the right move, not just emotionally, but also in terms of sporting project and ambition. b) Convince RB Leipzig that United can at least match Newcastle’s offer, whether through direct financial terms (a bid) or other guarantees. Without both, this becomes very difficult.’",
      "Fjortoft later added: ‘Subject: Re: Sesko Fresh updates from Leipzig this morning: the club still expects Manchester United to submit a bid. The key questions now are: Is this just a tactic to buy more time? Or are they trying to pressure Newcastle into raising their offer even further? Don’t forget- Newcastle’s deadline expires today.’",

      "After taking well over a month to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United are continuing their one-iron-in-the-transfer-fire approach by putting all of their efforts into signing a new No.9 this summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the man they want and we can safely assume a first formal bid – if and when it arrives – will fall short of the mark, like the second formal bid, and maybe even a third, before Sir Jim Ratcliffe holds his hands up and pays the piper.",
      "Either that or Sesko chooses Newcastle, which will be absolutely fine by Ruben Amorim, who has become perhaps the greatest-ever purveyor of the This Is Manchester United call to arms, despite being – or perhaps because he is – the worst Manchester United manager in the Premier League era.",
      "After a harrowing first season and with so-called ‘bad eggs’ either moving to Barcelona or currently training away from the rest of the squad while seeking an exit, Amorim has set his sights on footballers with a genuine love for Manchester United.",
      "By all accounts he’s found that deep-seated adoration in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, to whom he offered telling, on-brand advice before they decided to make their dream moves.",
      "“In the meetings with Bryan, with Cunha, we said that. Don’t go to a club because of the manager. Go because of the idea of the club. And they are here because of the idea of the club.”",
      "It’s a non-negotiable he’s stayed true to throughout the transfer window having made the vow before the end of last season when asked about a possible approach for Viktor Gyokeres: “We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "It’s a requirement of any aspiring United player which nearly cost Amorim the signing of Mbeumo, and may well have resulted in the club paying over the odds for the 25-year-old, with Brentford not at all happy that they approached him before them.",
      "But with innumerable post-Sir Alex Ferguson signings seeing a move to Old Trafford as a means to a hefty pay cheque and as their final destination in the worst possible ‘f*** it, I’ve made it’ sort of way, bringing about a whole club malaise that’s seen them plumb extraordinarily low depths, Amorim has quite rightly identified hunger as the key trait in new signings beyond them being excellent at football. If only it didn’t then take so bleeding long to sign them.",
      "We’re aware that a football club that “would have been bust by Christmas” had it not been for the lunch-denying, ticket price-increasing, redundancy king isn’t flush enough to be making offers for multiple players in multiple positions at the same time, but this linear approach to a transfer window has already cost Amorim the chance of a pre-season with a new striker, and threatens to leave him without another much-needed addition when the season starts in less than two weeks.",
      "They clearly have and have had the funds to sign all of Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Sesko, so why not look to sign them at the same time rather than waiting for one to be confirmed before moving onto the next? It’s like a toddler eating a meal from highest-value item to lowest. Don’t forget the central midfield broccoli, guys.",
      "Omar Berrada promised in June to “do our best to do more signings quickly”, adding that “when you’re not quick it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money”.",
      "So far they’ve met Cunha’s £62.5m release clause, took 44 days between first contact with Mbeumo and paying Brentford £17m over his market value to sign him, and are currently waiting to either pay the €80m Leipzig want on the terms they set for Sesko or walking away from a deal for a player who’s certainly now the club’s top target if not necessarily Amorim’s – he’s keen on Ollie Watkins – before presumably making a late-window dash to sign a central midfielder.",
      "Because let’s be absolutely clear – Amorim really needs a new central midfielder. He’s walking into a season knowing that none of his current possible pairings will work. Fabrizio Romano has revealed they dropped their not-so-secret interest in Joao Palhinha as Amorim decided he wanted a “less holding defensive midfielder – still defensive but with more intensity in their vision”.",
      "They don’t have that guy, and although they’ve been linked with Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand and Valencia’s Javi Guerra while ignoring the midfielder Romano is essentially describing there in Douglas Luiz, judging by the strategy of the transfer window thus far, United won’t even have made contact with a preferred option, let alone asked for the requisite pictures of them in a Cristiano Ronaldo shirt as a ten-year-old before initiating club-to-club talks.",
      "Amorim is to blame for the Sesko hold-up in so much as United are waiting for the striker to ‘commit’ to them over Newcastle before making a bid. But that in no way stops his bosses from multi-tasking. A lack of funds may do, but amid claims throughout the window that United must sell before they buy, they’ve sold precisely no-one and yet are prepared to take their spending to well over £200m if they get the green light from Sesko.",
      "The transfer window will be a success if United sign a striker and midfielder thanks to Amorim’s hard-and-fast rule on those new signings, but the start to his second season has been hamstrung by the club’s apparent inability to negotiate two signings at the same time.",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed what was said to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in transfer talks to help Manchester United beat Newcastle to signing them.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is reportedly excited at the prospect of Benjamin Sesko joining with the Red Devils ‘very optimistic’ a deal will get done.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s ‘spending is to continue’ after landing Benjamin Sesko as they will turn their attention to a new top target.",
      "Man Utd fans may have to settle for another year of Rasmus Hojlund up top after Ruben Amorim suggested he was happy with the Dane leading the line.",
      "The Manchester United push to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle is not being ‘driven’ by Ruben Amorim, who ‘prefers’ an alternative.",
      "Man Utd’s ‘next three signings’ have been ‘revealed’ as Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive” the remaining four members of the bomb squad."

      "Man Utd still “really want” to complete a deal to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa but a deal for Gianluigi Donnarumma has been ruled out, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been supported in the transfer market with the signings of Mathues Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon so far this summer – but many fans want lots more this summer.",
      "Man Utd seem to be in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig as their main striker target, while reports have claimed they also want to sign a new goalkeeper and defensive midfielder this summer.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with numerous goalkeepers as potential replacements for Andre Onana – who had a poor season at Old Trafford – and Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor is one of the latest names that Man Utd have been credited with interest in.",
      "Aston Villa and Argentina stopper Martinez has been heavily linked too with Man Utd reportedly having a loan bid rejected earlier in the summer.",
      "But now former Red Devils chief scout Mick Brown – who is still well-connected at Old Trafford – insists that Man Utd interest in Martinez “hasn’t gone away”.",
      "READ: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "Brown told Football Insider: “Man United still want to sign a goalkeeper. Ruben Amorim wants to strengthen in that position and has been looking to do so.",
      "“At the moment, they’re going to have to start the season without their first-choice goalkeeper because he’s picked up an injury in pre-season.",
      "“I expected them to do more to sign Emiliano Martinez, but I am told that interest hasn’t gone away. Whether it’s him or somebody else, they want a new goalkeeper before the window closes.",
      "“Aston Villa might have to sell somebody so United want to take advantage of that. I think Martinez is a very, very good goalkeeper who would be a major improvement on what they’ve got, and it seems the club agree with my view of things.",
      "“Obviously, they haven’t been able to sell Onana, but I’m not sure how much of an issue that will be. They wanted to do that before signing Martinez, but the interest just hasn’t been there and it looks like he’s going to be staying.",
      "“I think if they really want Martinez, they’ll try to get him even with Onana there and then hopefully they can move him on in January or next year.",
      "“That’s the decision the club will have to make, whether they want to balance having both of them.”",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Donnarumma is another player who has been mooted as a potential replacement for Onana but football finance expert Stefan Borson insists he would be “absolutely amazed” if the Italy international signed for Man Utd.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I would be absolutely amazed at that deal because remember, Donnarumma signed for PSG on a free transfer. The chances are he’s on £500,000 a week. Definitely €500,000 (£435,000).",
      "“If you look at the way PSG pay and you look at their total wage bill, there’s no possibility that they signed him on a free transfer for anything less than €500,000 a week.",
      "“He’s going to want the same again. I just can’t see it. I think he’d be a very good signing for them if he were prepared to go.",

      "A new report from The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed why Jackson is currently his ‘one to watch’, with the striker to become an ‘alternative recruit’ for clubs once the Alexander Isak and Benjamin Sesko sagas have finalised, as ‘there is not a huge array of candidates on the market’.",
      "Jackson is said to be ‘high’ among the options for clubs in the Premier League and Europe due to his ‘suitability and availability’, while he is ‘at risk of not being the primary forward and will want to be the main man somewhere’.",

      "Every summer, the likes of Fabrizio Romano, Florian Plettenberg and Gianluca Di Marzio declare that one transfer could trigger a ‘domino effect’. It never does. And yet, we delude ourselves into thinking it might.",
      "But…this summer, it just might.",
      "The potential domino effect doesn’t simply surround signing replacements, but also raising the funds to go out and sign a top target. That’s a strong factor this summer, anyway.",
      "With everything taken into account, we’ve predicted what will happen in the striker market before the 2025 summer transfer window closes. Here are ten different dominos set to fall this month.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko to Newcastle United\nThere’s only one deal that can truly get the ball rolling, and that’s Sesko to Newcastle United.",
      "The RB Leipzig and Slovenia striker was under consideration at Arsenal before they swerved toward the Viktor Gyokeres lane, going all in on signing him after deeming Leipzig’s demands for Sesko too steep.",
      "It’s reported that the Bundesliga club want a guaranteed £65million, some add-ons, and a percentage of a future sale.",
      "Newcastle thought they’d have an opening bid worth £65m + £4m in add-ons accepted, but David Ornstein says it has been deemed ‘insufficient’ over in Germany. The add-ons weren’t enough, or maybe it was the lack of a future fee guarantee – we’re not entirely sure.",
      "Either way, the Magpies need to return with another offer, or Manchester United could swoop in. They have no intention of selling Alexander Isak before having a replacement sorted, so unless Liverpool cough up £150m over the next few days, we can’t see that transfer being the one that triggers the domino.",
      "The Red Devils are still in the picture but haven’t made a bid for Sesko…yet. If they get an indication that the 22-year-old prefers them to Newcastle, they’ll probably sign him. They need to sell but could get Sesko and work that out later, with Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all available for transfer.",
      "In an ideal world for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, they’ll bring in around £100m and significantly reduce the wage bill in the process.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak to Liverpool\nAssuming Sesko to Newcastle is the first domino to fall, the door will be firmly open for Isak to complete a dream move to Anfield.",
      "The Premier League champions remain in a strong financial position despite already spending £263m. They’ve been sensible enough in the transfer market over the years to enable such an expensive outlay, and recently sold Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich for £65m and Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.",
      "Newcastle signing Sesko doesn’t completely force their hand when it comes to selling Isak either; they’ve always wanted to sign another striker this summer and are still working on a deal to sign Brentford’s Yoane Wissa.",
      "Isak didn’t travel to Asia for the Magpies’ pre-season tour and has burned some bridges with the club’s fanbase through his attempts to force a move to Liverpool. Many don’t want to see him don the black and white stripes again, while others accept the situation and would do anything for their elite centre-forward to stay ahead of a Champions League campaign.",
      "That’s extremely unlikely, and Isak’s move to Liverpool feels like a case of when, not if.",
      "MORE ON ISAK TO LIVERPOOL\n👉 Liverpool ‘have played a blinder’ over Isak to ‘gazump’ Newcastle ‘no matter what’\n👉 £150m Alexander Isak would *actually* be the ninth most expensive Premier League player ever\n👉 Liverpool swap for Isak worth a ‘bash’ thanks to Eddie Howe and Newcastle failsafe",
      "",
      "8) Darwin Nunez to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool want to sell Nunez no matter what. Clubs in Italy have been strongly linked throughout the summer, but it looks like Captain Chaos is off to the Middle East.",
      "You can put this transfer second or third on this ranking. If he’s sold before Isak is signed, then the Reds are even more equipped to pay a British record fee. If Isak is signed first, the Reds’ stance on Nunez doesn’t change: he’s still set for the exit door.",
      "We’ll miss Nunez and his unpredictable nature, but a summer transfer is the right thing for everyone. It remains to be seen if he’s fully on board with a switch to Saudi, but he knows there’s no place for him in Arne Slot’s squad anymore – especially if Isak joins.",
      "",
      "7) Ollie Watkins to Manchester United\nUnited have narrowed down their striker shortlist to two completely different players: Watkins and Sesko. The former loves getting in behind and does most of his business in and around the 18-yard box, while Sesko drops deep and takes long-range shots.",
      "Is that what United need? Not really. Is that what United have prioritised over the experienced Watkins? Of course it is.",
      "If Sesko joins Newcastle, United – assuming Ruben Amorim has any say in striker recruitment – will surely turn their attention to Watkins. And at 29, there are reservations over Watkins’ resale value. United really shouldn’t care about that. When was the last time they sold someone for a profit? Not counting academy players, it was Alvaro Carreras, and they still managed to mess that up spectacularly.",
      "Just forget about that and get an outstanding centre-forward through the bloody door.",
      "Missing out on Sesko will surely reignite United’s interest in the Aston Villa star, and despite being reluctant to lose him, Unai Emery’s side should sanction a sale for £40-50m. And if he joins the Red Devils, they’ll be even more desperate to offload their unwanted players.",
      "",
      "6) Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea\nOne of those unwanted players is Garnacho, who Chelsea want to sign because Chelsea want to sign all of the players.",
      "Does paying £50m for the 21-year-old make sense when Tyrique George is Right There? And £50m has already been spent on Jamie Gittens this summer? Oh, and Mykhaylo Mudryk exists even without a shirt number. He’s suspended but is still there and could return tomorrow, in two months, or four years. Nobody knows.",
      "Simply put, Chelsea don’t need Garnacho.",
      "The overriding point is that Chelsea will always be Chelsea, and their unrelenting desire to sign players means they’re convinced Garnacho can become one of the best wingers in the world. Just as they were with Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Estevao and Angelo. They are deluded, but integral to the transfer domino, with interest in Garnacho completely separate from their Xavi Simons pursuit.",
      "",
      "5) Christopher Nkunku to Manchester United\nThe Blues’ transfer addiction means players who don’t do very, very well are on the chopping block. It’s a revolving door at Stamford Bridge. Their next signing will be their 50th over the last four years. Manchester United, who are chronically addicted to trying to make things right in the transfer window, bought Ander Herrera 49 signings ago.",
      "Nkunku has been expected to leave Chelsea for a while, but he’s still at the club and still played in this summer’s Club World Cup, scoring once. Efforts to offload the Frenchman will ramp up when Simons or Garnacho are signed, and we can see him following Watkins to Old Trafford.",
      "Swap deals almost never happen, and PSR means they’re a bad idea, so the Garnacho and Nkunku deals will be separate. And the latter’s move to United will open the door for another Old Trafford exit…",
      "",
      "4) Rasmus Hojlund to Juventus\n“I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay at Manchester United. I want to fight for my spot whatever happens,” said Hojlund last week. But the transfer domino effect has spoken.",
      "Leipzig are interested in making Hojlund part of the Sesko deal, and the Dane is also an option for AC Milan, while Juventus have been linked and want a striker as well.",
      "Having done well for Atalanta in Serie A, Hojlund could open the door for a return, and it doesn’t come much bigger than Juve in Italy.",
      "",
      "3) Dusan Vlahovic to AC Milan\nAnd if Juventus sign Hojlund, there’s no doubt that Vlahovic will move on. The Old Lady are reportedly keen to offload the former Arsenal target and are also working on a deal for Randal Kolo Muani, who is tangentially involved in the domino.",
      "But Hojlund’s move, coupled with Nunez going to Al-Hilal, means Milan’s striker shortlist will be down to Stade Rennais’ Arnaud Kalimuendo and Vlahovic. For pure convenience, we’re saying the Juve man makes the move to San Siro.",
      "",
      "2) Arnaud Kalimuendo to Brentford\nIt’s awfully convenient, as it opens the door for Brentford to sign Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "The Bees have been linked with the Frenchman and Arsenal’s Leandro Trossard, but the former is a natural centre-forward and exactly what they need as Wissa does everything in his power to leave.",
      "Wissa is refusing to train and will leave Brentford under acrimonious circumstances, having been promised a £26m transfer this summer after pledging his future to the club last year. After losing Man United signing Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford’s stance changed, and Wissa is very, very upset.",
      "Clearly having some level of understanding and sympathy for a player who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, Brentford aren’t sitting still and have identified Kalimuendo as a potential signing. He won’t come cheap, but Keith Andrews needs some real quality in his team after selling Mbeumo and Christian Nørgaard.",
      "",
      "1) Yoane Wissa to Newcastle\nThe transfer domino starts and finishes at St James’ Park, as Wissa finally finds his way to the northeast after Brentford sign Milan target Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "Poor Aston Villa are left in the dust without a Watkins replacement because ten is the magic number. An honourable mention for Kolo Muani here will suffice.",
      "As mentioned before, the plan has always been for Eddie Howe to receive a new striker to play with Isak, and that could happen with Wissa or Sesko joining and their star player staying, or with Wissa playing alongside Sesko in 2025/26.",
      "Despite all the aggro surrounding Wissa’s situation, we think he’ll get his Magpies move. Whether it comes after these nine deals remains to be seen, but the timeline is absolutely spot on. Bring it on, we say.",
      "READ NEXT: Yoane Wissa deserves our sympathy…but not as much as poor Brentford fans",

      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has utilised an interesting play for his next transfer as he has reportedly told two interested sides, Manchester United and Newcastle, that he ‘only wants to join them’.",
      "Sesko has been on the radar of a number of Premier League clubs this summer. It looked like he could have landed at last season’s second-placed side Arsenal, before they instead opted for Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Sesko has since been pursued by Newcastle and Man Utd. The former club might need a new striker amid uncertainty over the future of Alexander Isak, while United’s starting striker options severely underwhelmed last season.",
      "It seems neither side truly knows where Sesko’s head is at, though, as he has made an interesting play, according to Bild.",

      "Newcastle are said to want clarity ‘quickly’ and have set a ‘short deadline’ for the potential transfer. Though he is said to have told them he wants to join, Sesko is apparently ‘slightly favouring’ United.",
      "After a total package worth £69.6million was rejected by Leipzig from Newcastle – the right total but wanted in one go, without add-ons – it’s been reported United are willing match it.",
      "That is supported by the Bild report, but it states they are ‘expected’ to make the offer only when Sesko rejects Newcastle and ‘commits’ to the Red Devils.",
      "But Sesko needs United to guarantee that they can financially support the deal, which is not guaranteed, because they still need to sell players in order to do so.",
      "Leipzig, meanwhile, want things settled soon so they can sign a replacement if they need to do so, with Romulo Cardoso and Fabio Silva named as potential successors.",
      "Reports have shrouded United’s move for Sesko in further doubt, with the finances surely not available if they can confirm the deal they want.",
      "It’s been reported that United want to make a ‘monumental offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr, which would see them allocate ‘their entire summer budget’ to the signing of the superstar winger.",
      "However, that seems fanciful, as it’s suggested they’re preparing a €200million (£174m) offer. United almost certainly do not have that to spend, given it’s know they’ll have to sell to buy any more players, so that move seems very unlikely.",

      "20) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to RB Leipzig\nThere have been murmurs of a swap deal involving Hojlund and Sesko, but the former really doesn’t want to leave United. The Premier League club signing Sesko seems contingent on player sales, whether it’s before they bid or after, so sending Hojlund to Germany works well for them. It’s all too good to be true, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Jeremy Jacquet – Rennes to Arsenal\nAnother defender, Mikel? That’s insane. Arsenal’s interest in Jacquet will only be accelarated should Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior leave. The latter is attracting interest from all over Europe, but Arteta wants to keep him. Arsenal even rejected an offer from Portugal earlier this summer for the Pole, who’s destined for a place on this rumour ranking very, very soon.",

      "18) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in the agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",

      "",
      "15) 🆕 John Victor – Botafogo to West Ham\nThe Hammers have made an opening bid for the Manchester United-linked goalkeeper, who starred for Botafogo at this summer’s Club World Cup. If you were given the choice to be second-choice at Old Trafford or *potentially* first-choice at the London Stadium, what would you choose?",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Let’s see who blinks first…",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £50m and expected to move due to his lack of desire to sign an extension. Guehi has also been linked with Liverpool, who could continue their assault on the Magpies by hijacking the deal…",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThere are no negotiations between United and Chelsea but Romano says the winger is giving his ‘full priority’ to the Club World Cup winners. The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave. This club, man…",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t. United are now behind their league rivals in the race for Sesko.",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin recently in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "7) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal is dropping down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",

      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nNewcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters but a Magpies bid is in. Let’s see whether or not Leipzig reject it and if the Red Devils react…",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool rejected an offer of around £70m from Al-Hilal for Nunez in January and will not delude themselves into thinking a summer sale could generate nearly as much. But another piece in their Isak puzzle could fall into place thanks to the Magpies’ owners. PIF want to give the Saudi Pro League runners-up a shiny new centre-forward and Nunez has been earmarked as that man, with the Uruguayan described as ‘receptive’ to that interest ahead of bidding.",

      "",
      "2) 🆕 Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – Chelsea to Everton\nWell, that was an underwhelming year for Dewsbury-Hall…on a personal level, anyway. He barely played for Chelsea in the Premier League and is now set for a switch to the Hill Dickinson. This is a top move for the player and both clubs.",

      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer thinks Man Utd and the Magpies would be taking “a gamble” by signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The Geordies have made a €80m bid for Sesko, reaching the German side’s valuation, but it was turned down by Leipzig over the structure of a deal.",
      "Reports claim that Man Utd are set to ‘match’ Newcastle‘s offer for the Slovenia international with the Red Devils waiting on the green light from the player.",
      "Both the Red Devils and the Magpies have missed out on other targets so far this summer and it will be a tough blow to take for whichever club loses out on Sesko.",
      "But former Newcastle striker Shearer insists that a transfer for Sesko is “a gamble” for Man Utd or Newcastle as he is young and unproven in the Premier League.",
      "Shearer said on The Rest Is Football podcast: “With Sesko, I know he’s young, but that would be a gamble because you’re going to have to pay a decent sized fee.",
      "“I saw him two or three times in the Champions League last season and there’s definitely room for improvement.",
      "“Yes, there’s certainly a talent there but there’s a lot improvement that can be made as well. You’re bringing someone who’s unknown into the Premier League and that’s always a bit of a risk.”",
      "On Newcastle’s transfer window so far, Shearer added: “Up to now it’s been a disastrous window for Newcastle. It was meant to be the time we kicked on with heavy investment and hopefully go to another level. It’s been anything but that to be honest.",
      "“They’ve missed out on several first-choice targets, so up to now it’s been really poor. Their transfer window has been a mess.",
      "READ: Seven banished players who have been stripped of their shirt number this summer – including three No. 10s",
      "“I thought Isak might have stayed for another season and then this would have happened next summer. But it is what it is.",
      "“If he can’t be persuaded to stay then you take the money and you just say, “thanks for the great memories, off you go.”",
      "German football expert Rune Gjerulff has identified the areas of Sesko’s game that he will need to improve to adapt to the Premier League.",
      "Gjerulff told Bulinews: “It was quite a tough season for Leipzig, which forced them to change coach after a disappointing Champions League campaign. They’ve been struggling, which reflects on his output, but he was still one of their best and most consistent players.",
      "“Sesko’s strengths are certainly his physicality and speed – he’s great at making dangerous runs in behind defences, but he’s also a very clinical and instinctive finisher, especially when the ball drops to him in the area. His work rate is good and he’s a willing runner off the ball as well.",
      "“His hold-up play is quite strong, but I think his link-up play is a side of his game that he can still improve. It’s not that he’s bad at that side of the game, but compared to someone like Kai Havertz, he’s not at that level. In particular, his passing will need to get a lot better.",
      "“But during his young career, he’s shown he can take those steps forward. His mentality is definitely a strength – he’s a player who wants to learn and wants to improve so in that sense he will be a quick learner.”",
      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer has slammed the Magpies for a “ridiculous” lie which kicked off the Alexander Isak saga, as the striker wants to leave the club.",
      "Chelsea have already signed a number of players this summer meaning some outgoings are expected.",

      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Newcastle's new offer is £69.7m as a fixed fee plus add-ons;  Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 13:39, UK",
      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "It is understood Newcastle are now offering £69.7m (€80m) as a fixed fee plus add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "They have since been negotiating with Leipzig and have now raised their offer.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko.",
      "United have not made an official bid and are aware of Newcastle's latest offer, but they intend to remain disciplined and will not get drawn into a bidding war",
      "Sesko is believed to be open to both projects, although one source has claimed he has been leaning towards United, if they can agree a deal with Leipzig.",
      "It is thought United would want a clear indication Sesko only wants to join them before making a formal bid.",
      "While United's focus has been on Sesko, he is not the only striker United are looking at.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for several strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Man Utd's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit by Isak's desire to leave but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, although the Brentford striker wants to join the Magpies.",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their alternative to Alexander Isak at No 9.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best, so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\"",

      "Match report as Man Utd wrap up a Premier League Summer Series win with a 2-2 draw against Everton; Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty and Mason Mount was also on target; Iliman Ndiaye scored for Everton before an Ayden Heaven own goal",
      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.",
      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",
      "\"It's improving,\" he said. \"But it's not the place it needs to be.",

      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
