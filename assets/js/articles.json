      "A controversial transfer plan involving Manchester United and Real Madrid has been labelled 'pure invention' by the agent of Benfica star Alvaro Carreras. The left-back, 22, joined Benfica from United last year and has caught the eye of clubs across Europe thanks to his impressive performances.",
      "When they agreed to sell Carreras for around £5million, United negotiated a buyback clause which is worth £17m. Benfica themselves moved to put a £51m release clause in the Spaniard's contract.",
      "Real are reluctant to pay such a high price in the summer transfer window, so have reportedly come up with a workaround. The Spanish giants, who Carreras spent three years with at youth level, are said to want United to activate their buyback clause and then immediately sell him to them for £29m.",
      "That'd net United a cool £12m in profit which would improve their well-documented financial situation, with Ruben Amorim's summer recruitment plans hinging on big-money sales. But Carreras' agent, Gines Carvajal, has poured cold water on suggestiosn that Real and United could form the controversial agreement.",
      "\"I don't know where this news comes from,\" Carvajal is quoted as saying by Sport. \"Everything being said is pure invention and doesn't deserve any comment from me.\"",
      "The agent went on to confirm that Carreras won't be going anywhere this summer, adding: \"Carreras is doing very well at Benfica and will continue there.\"",
      "In January, the 22-year-old affirmed that he was 'happy' playing for the Portuguese giants, who are battling city rivals Sporting Lisbon for both the league and cup with just a few games to go.",
      "\"I have a contract for many years here at Benfica, I'm happy,\" Carreras declared via Record. \"They gave me the opportunity to grow, and I owe everything to them.\"",
      "Having left Madrid in 2020, Carreras never made a first-team appearance for United. He was loaned out to Preston North End, Granada and then Benfica, who signed him permanently in January 2024.",
      "United are well-stocked at left-back as things stand. The Red Devils signed Patrick Dorgu for £25m in January and have Luke Shaw back from injury.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is also due back from his loan spell with PSV Eindhoven unless the Dutch heavyweights sign him permanently. And finally, academy product Harry Amass made his Premier League debut in March and appears to be highly rated by United boss Amorim.",

      "Right now, one of the few dispiriting things about professional football is the tendency of modern players and managers to apologise to fans. It seems there are a lot of people who expect those players and managers to beat themselves up when things are not going so well.",
      "Perform terribly, say sorry to your followers, maybe even refund their travel expenses. It is faintly pathetic.",
      "James Maddison clearly thinks so. When asked if he thought the Spurs team “owed them (supporters) one in this competition (the Europa League), given what they have been going through”, Maddison did not exactly toe what has become the party line.",
      "“They or we? We’ve been going through it.” And when it was then suggested “you’ve been putting them through it with the results in the league”, Maddison responded: “On purpose?”",
      "Good on him. At the moment, there is a lot of talk about fans. Real fans, tourist fans, etc etc. The game has probably always had both.",
      "But here’s the truth. If you support a club, you support the players through thick and thin. Or thin and thin, in some cases.",
      "That’s the contract. You don’t ask them to say sorry or to pay for your ticket and bus fare if they happen to play badly.",
      "There is only one thing players and managers should apologise for … not trying. And it is very rare that players and managers do not try.",
      "That is Maddison’s point. The Spurs players have not deliberately been rubbish. So what do they owe to anyone? And the same goes for Manchester United. I’ve seen United a lot this season and, mostly, they have been pretty hopeless. But they have always tried.",
      "And so, when something actually does come off, they should be allowed to enjoy it, and should be suitably lauded for it. Instead, Ruben Amorim feels compelled to spend half his time self-flagellating, saying that this Europa League run is nice but winning the whole thing will still NOT save United’s season.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Harry Maguire were the latest in a long line of players to say likewise. It’s rubbish. Lads, it WILL save your season. You probably know that so don’t be afraid of saying it.",
      "It is a major trophy and, rightly or wrongly, it will mean you participate in next season’s Champions League. You have already given your supporters the odd memorable occasion in this tournament and there might well be another in Bilbao in a couple of weeks time.",
      "You might yet win more than Manchester City win this season. You might yet win more than Arsenal win this season. It goes without saying that your domestic form has been lousy this season so there really is no need to say it.",
      "But you were 31 points in arrears of last season’s Premier League champions and you were never really going to win it this season. Yes, there has been a very significant under-performance in the Premier League but United have excelled in Europe, albeit in the second-tier competition.",
      "Would Amorim and Maguire prefer to be battling it out in a Premier League title race right now rather than be in the lower reaches of the table but with a Europa League final almost certainly to look forward to?Probably the former.",
      "But if they safely negotiate the second leg of the semi-finals and then win in Bilbao on May 21, their season WILL be saved. And anyone saying otherwise is just playing to the gallery."

      "If United triumph in the Europa League final in Bilbao on May 21, this would mean an astonishing £100,000-a-week boost for Casemiro, pushing his weekly earnings to a whopping £500,000. That's the same figure Cristiano Ronaldo was pocketing during his second stint at Old Trafford.",

      "Long-serving receptionist Kath Phipps had been with United for 55 years before her death in 2024, and is understood to be the only staff member to have spent longer at Old Trafford than Marron. United paid tribute to \"one-woman institution\" Phipps when she died aged 85, with former players also sharing messages.",
      "According to The Mail, Marron - who joined United in 1978 - is expected to leave at the end of the season. The publication claims as many as 200 staff members are in danger of being axed in the latest round of cuts under part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, and she is believed to be among those at risk - though no final decision has been made.",
      "The same publication describes Marron as a liaison point between United and a number of major footballing bodies, including the FA, FIFA and UEFA. Her role has included significant involvement in key moments for the club, including the 1999 Champions League final in Barcelona.",
      "Marron is understood to have been back in Spain this week for United's Europa League match away to Athletic Bilbao. United won that game by a 3-0 scoreline, leaving them well-placed to return to San Mames for the final on May 21.",

United are 3-0 up after the first leg of their semi-final with Athletic Bilbao and could face Premier League rivals Tottenham in the showpiece game in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Littler, the 18-year-old who became the youngest-ever world champion in January, would love to see his favourite team in a Euro final. But a Premier League darts date in Sheffield is already booked for the following evening - and Luke the Nuke isn't prepared to spend any of his estimated £1.5million fortune on a private jet to get him to Spain.",
      "Littler said: \"I have been looking at flights - but I'll go only if I’m allowed. Even if I don’t go, I’ll obviously watch it. I don’t think a PJ [private jet] is worth it.\"",
      "Warrington-based Littler, speaking to SportsBoom.co.uk, made Premier League history on Thursday night when he beat Dutchman Michael van Gerwen 6-4 in Birmingham to become the player to win five nightly events in a single season since the format of the tournament changed in 2022.",
      "He had earlier beaten Stephen Bunting and Nathan Aspinall to seal Night 13 and collect a £10,000 bonus. United were hammering the highly-fancied Spaniards at the same time and Littler was spotted checking the score in Bilbao between matches and even managed to watch some of the action on TV.",

      "He said: \"Obviously I am happy, I'm into the final of the UK Open at my third attempt. But in the second break I heard about the Manchester United loss so it spurred me on a bit, won the next five.",

      "His performances have been key to Oliver Glasner's side reaching the FA Cup final this season. But it appears that they could bid farewell to Eze sooner rather than later.",
      "According to The Sun, Glasner has given his blessing to the forward departing the club this summer. Premier League rivals Spurs and Man United have been linked with a move for him in the past and with a £60m release clause written into his contract, they could be tempted to move over the coming months.",
      "Eze, 26, has scored nine goals and notched 11 assists for Crystal Palace in all competitions this season. Speaking about his displays after an FA Cup win against Fulham earlier this season, Glasner said: “I think Ebere has had a strange season, he hasn’t had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going, he’s also struggled with strange injuries.",
      "“The goal against Latvia and his first for England means a lot for him him. He always has the confidence, we know he’s an amazing finisher to cut inside on his right foot with an amazing finish. We need this quality, he helped us today massively.”",
      "Should Eze move on this summer, it would be the second consecutive post-season window that a star player moved on. Michael Olise completed a move away to German giants Bayern Munich last summer, with chairman Steve Parish left shocked that there wasn’t the same amount of interest in Eze.",
      "\"I was astounded. Genuinely astounded. I mean, the guy's just an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.\"",

      "Hojlund has registered just 14 Premier League goals since arriving at Old Trafford in a £72million deal from Atalanta in the summer of 2023. Zirkzee scored just seven times in all competitions following his move from Bologna ahead of the current campaign.",
      "That poor return has convinced superstar fan Usain Bolt that United need recruits up-front. The nine-time Olympic gold medallist has picked out Palmer, Lookman and Gyokeres as prime targets.",
      "Bolt told B/R Football : \"The left winger from Atalanta. He's called Lookman, I've watched him throughout. He's pretty good. And I think Cole Palmer. He's really showed his class. And the striker is, is Viktor from Sporting. Those are the three signing I would definitely get for this summer.\"",
      "Palmer enjoyed a breakthrough season in his debut year at Stamford Bridge, scoring 27 goals and registering 15 assists in all competitions. This campaign has been more difficult for the England international though.",
      "He has hit the back of the net only 14 times in all competitions and is currently on an 18-game drought, dating back to January. Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca last week claimed that Palmer's struggles are a mental issue.",
      "\"For sure it's a mental thing, it's not tactical or technical,\" Maresca said. \"Cole is still the player who scored 14 goals in 20 games. The style is the same, the manager is the same, the club is the same.",
      "\"Nothing has changed around Cole. It's just mentally in this moment. You can see he's a little bit worried because he wants to help the team. You can see he's struggling a bit on that. But he showed how happy he was after Fulham.",
      "\"It's just a matter (of whether) we can win games. For sure he's going to score goals. If you go back game by game, he had at least every game one or two chances, so it's not about how the team is playing.\"",
      "Palmer will be hoping to break his drought on Sunday afternoon when Chelsea host champions Liverpool. It would be extremely difficult for United to buy Palmer, with the Englishman contracted to Chelsea until 2033.",

Harry Maguire, Alejandro Garnacho, Casemiro and Noussair Mazraoui come into the same category, while keeper Andre Onana and striker Rasmus Hojlund are also likely to be safeguarded because Amorim’s alternatives are so limited.",

      "Mastantuono, who turns 18 years old in August, has been highly praised by a host of footballing stars, including current Blues midfielder Enzo Fernandez and ex-River Plate star Matias Almeyda.",
      "While many have pointed to Lamine Yamal as the number one replacement for Messi's talent, Almeyda believes that the young Argentinian is emerging as Lionel's successor.",
      "Speaking to DSports Radio, the current AEK Athens manager said: \"Another Maradona or another Messi will unlikely emerge, but another player will come.",
      "\"After Maradona, people said that there would never be another like him, and then Messi appeared, and I think that after Messi, another one will appear, and his name is Franco Mastantuono.\"",
      "Almeyda also claimed that there will be more shining stars coming out of Argentina, adding: \"There are many kids who won't be equal to those two, but they will be at another level. We're a breeding ground for very good players.\"",
      "Mastantuono has also received some high praise from World Cup winner and Chelsea star Fernandez, who claimed the teenager is ready for the big move to Europe. When asked about the River Plate star, the 24-year-old told ESPN F12: \"He’s showing that he has a European future.",
      "\"You can see it. He’s an incredible player. He’s doing very well and has shown great talent. In my opinion, he’s a star. I wish him the best and hope he can achieve all his goals. Hopefully he can also help us in the national team.\"",
      "Current River Plate manager Marcelo Gallardo has also waxed lyrical about the young midfielder, but tempered his expectations for the star given his young age.",
      "Gallardo said: \"What we have to do is support him; he's a kid who has his feet on the ground, but it's not a bad idea to support him and make him feel like he has to keep growing.\"",
      "Mastantuono may well not decide to move in the summer, given that River Plate president Jorge Brito collected a £46million profit in last season's financial results - meaning they are under no pressure to sell.",
      "However, the 17-year-old has a release clause of just £38m - which is the highest-ever in the Argentinian club's history - but is relatively modest in terms of the Premier League's pricing in recent years.",
      "Mastantuono's contract also only runs until next season - 2026 - so it is likely that he could be tempted towards a future in one of the top leagues in Europe.",

      "Ralf Rangnick has claimed Manchester United are now “significantly worse” despite spending MILLIONS since his spell at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have struggled in the Premier League this term as they sit 14th with just four matches of the season left to play.",
      "And while Man United’s Premier League woes aren’t exactly new - they have not qualified for the Champions League since 2021 - former boss Rangnick has claimed that things have got even worse since his interim spell at the club at the back-end of the 2021/22 campaign.",
      "Speaking to Canal+ Austria, he said: “In the end. That a few basic things need to be changed and since then 700 or if not £750m has been spent on new players. And in the table they are even significantly worse than back then.",
      "“They could actually, with a win in the Europa League, still save this season. Because then they will be in the Champions League. Everything else would be a disappointment, and it will be interesting to see what will happen.”",
      "And while Rangnick has slammed the club’s transfer acumen over the past few years, he has also taken aim at the decision to appoint Ruben Amorim - a coach that he believes is not suited to the players at his disposal. He added: “They have signed a coach in the middle of the season who plays with a three or a five-back, and the squad was built based on a four-back system.",
      "“This is what you see when you see them play, especially in Premier League games against the opponents against which Manchester United normally has to win.",
      "\"Sure, in the Europa League, they have - usually with the result against Lyon, you are eliminated - they have turned it around. And of course, the stadium had a huge effect.”",
      "Rangnick has never been afraid to share his true opinion of the Red Devils. Even during his time at the club, he admitted that the club needed ‘open heart surgery’ to get them back in on track.",
      "In the end, Rangnick led United to sixth place in his spell with the club and he was eventually replaced by Erik ten Hag. And despite the Dutchman winning the FA Cup and League Cup, he was sacked midway through the current campaign after a woeful start to the season.",
      "Things have not improved under Amorim from a league point of view but they could still return to the Champions League with silverware should they win the Europa League.",

      "I can still clearly recall the phone call almost 39 years later. “He’s from Chingford, his name is David Beckham.” said the voice on the other end of the line.",
      "It was December 1986 and in the football world, not that many people would have heard of the player who has become arguably the most famous ever from these shores. Except, in my corner of the globe, as sports editor of the Waltham Forest Guardian in North East London, we certainly had.",
      "As a claim to fame (and please shout if anyone else is out there!), I was the first person ever in the media to write the words David Beckham. Happy 50th birthday. I remember you at 11.",
      "Beckham's name would appear in the pages of our weekly newspaper because of his exploits playing for local club Ridgeway Rovers who were based not far away in Chingford. Yes, the same Ridgeway Rovers who another future England captain, Harry Kane, would play for in years to come.",
      "That Monday morning in December the call was to invite me to spend the weekend in Manchester for the final of the TSB Bobby Charlton Soccer Skills competition. The TSB representative told me that the bank was taking local paper journalists from some of the regional winners of their competition to Old Trafford to watch the national final. Our local winner was “David Beckham”.",
      "And so to Manchester I go. With the Beckham family, where the finale to the event would be on the Old Trafford pitch on the Sunday afternoon before a First Division match (Premier League, what was that?) between Manchester United and Tottenham. The day began at United’s training ground, with ball juggling, target shooting and short passing, with points for each discipline. Every player gained bonus points for each time they controlled the ball with part of their body and not their feet.",
      "Beckham was in a different class as I stood watching with his parents, Sandra and Ted. Amazingly, he kept the ball in the air for a minute, the maximum time, and the bonuses kept rolling in.",
      "Then it was to Old Trafford where Beckham’s skills came to the fore again, including directly hitting a cone. He ended with 1,110 points – 100 more than he had achieved in the week’s course which had seen him qualify for the final.",
      "When it was all over, we assembled in one of the lounges at Old Trafford and Sir Bobby Charlton said of Beckham: “He really is a special lad. When the youngsters were warming up before the start of the competition he stood out among them all. He has great vision, he has great skill, his dedication reminds me of myself and he can go a long way.”",
      "United kept a close eye on Beckham after this and on May 2 1989, the day of his 14th birthday, Alex Ferguson signed him on a schoolboy contract. “Dynamic David joins United” read our back page headline that week in the Waltham Forest Guardian.",

      "Jurgen Klopp and Steven Gerrard both think Manchester United would be signing a top-quality player if they could pull off a mega swap deal for Ollie Watkins. United are claimed to be considering a stunning swap deal for Watkins, which would see Marcus Rashford’s move to Aston Villa become permanent.",
      "Rashford has been on loan at Villa Park since January, notching four assists and two goals in 14 games after being frozen out by Ruben Amorim at his parent club, United. The Red Devils previously valued Rashford at £40million but the 27-year-old could now be used to bring in his England team-mate, according to the Daily Star.",
      "Amorim is in desperate need of a quality No. 9 and could use Watkins’ current situation to his advantage. Watkins has become frustrated with his lack of game time since January, with Unai Emery preferring Rashford up top.",
      "The 29-year-old has found himself out of the starting line-up for much of April. But Watkins, who has 16 goals and 13 assists in 50 games this season, is still highly rated by various rival clubs, as well as some big names in English football.",
      "Liverpool icons - former manager Klopp and legendary Gerrard - have spoken glowingly about him in the past, indirectly giving United the green light to sign him. Gerrard worked with Watkins during his year-long stint in charge of Villa and paid him the ultimate sign of respect by comparing him to one of the best Liverpool strikers this century.",
      "\"I picture Ollie Watkins at his best when he's really front-footed, aggressive with that bit between his teeth,\" said Gerrard.",
      "\"He is a lovely player on the eye with the goals he scores and his technical ability. He reminds me in a lot of ways, in terms of his profile and how he goes about it, of a player I played with – Fernando Torres.\"",
      "Klopp was just as effusive when commenting on Watkins back in 2021, just months after the forward netted a perfect hat-trick in Villa’s 7-2 win over the Reds.",
      "The German said: “Ollie is a really, really talented striker. Obviously the manager knew him from before and it was a really good signing. The whole Brentford attacking line was exceptional in the Championship season before.",
      "\"So that suits really well, he's physically strong so he can keep the ball, he can jump high, he is very fast – that's a good package.",
      "\"Nobody has to remind me how good he is but how we always try to defend strikers, we try to avoid passes into their area. With him, that's not different than it is to others.\"",
      "But instead of Liverpool approaching Villa to buy Watkins, he was strongly linked with another top Premier League club, Arsenal, in January. Gerrard’s fellow Liverpool hero Jamie Carragher recently claimed that Villa offered the Englishman to Arsenal, but the Gunners only bid around £50m for him, which wasn’t deemed sufficient to allow him to leave.",
      "United are keen to offload Rashford permanently in the summer, but there's a chance Villa won't take him - or entertain any swap deal proposals involving the player - despite his upturn in form in 2025. Watkins, meanwhile, admitted he was angry with boss Unai Emery after playing a crucial role in Villa's win over Newcastle.",
      "He said: “I’m not going to lie – I was fuming I wasn’t playing. I let him know that. He's the manager at the end of the day. I respect his decision. But I'm not one of the players happy to sit on the bench.",
      "\"It's something I haven't experienced before, missing out on the biggest stage. You always want to play, especially in the Champions League. Me and a few others are disappointed we didn't start the game, but like I said, it's the manager's decision.",
      "“I wanted to be starting in the important games because I've played a big part to get to where we are today. Rather than let it hinder you, you have to use that anger and let it spur you on to prove the manager different.\"",
      "One thing that could go against United should they continue to pursue Watkins is the fact that Villa remain in the hunt for a Champions League spot next season and look guaranteed to secure European football of some flavour.",
      "United, on the other hand, will have to win the Europa League to secure a spot in Europe next season, which could determine whether or not they land some of their priority targets in the summer.",

      "“It's been a difficult season, it's been a disappointing season, but football is about memories, it's about creating memories, it's about winning trophies and we have a great opportunity to win a trophy. For our fans, for what they deserve, so that's the most important thing.”",
      "Manchester United would enjoy significantly more rest than Tottenham Hotspur if the two teams end up meeting in the Europa League final. Spurs won 3-1 at home to Bodo/Glimt in their first leg, with Brennan Johnson, James Maddison and Dominik Solanke all on target before Ulrik Saltnes pulled one back late on.",
      "United's last league game before the final is a Friday night kick-off against Chelsea, with the game brought forward thanks to the respective clubs' womens' sides meeting in the Women's FA Cup final two days later. Spurs aren't in action until the Sunday during that round of matches, when they face Aston Villa more than 42 hours after their potential final opponents take to the field.",
      "Spurs attempted to bring the Villa game forward to the Thursday night to help their European chances. However, their opponents - battling for European qualification themselves - said no.",
      "Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen has talked up the quality of fellow frontman Matheus Cunha amid continued Manchester United links. Cunha, who has a £62.5million release clause - is a target for a number of Premier League clubs going into the summer transfer window after delivering 15 goals and six assists in the league.",
      "\"Amazing player,\" Strand Larsen told talkSPORT. \"Hopefully we can keep him for a long time, but you know how it works. A player like him, scoring goals, giving assists, having great games, it's difficult to keep, obviously.",
      "\"But he's such an amazing guy off the pitch and then on the pitch. You can all see it. I don't need to tell you anything. He gives passes you can't really see. My goal last weekend [against Leicester], it wouldn't happen if his pass wasn't really, really top.\"",

      "Everton do have a decision to make on one of their strikers at the club with Dominic Calvert-Lewin out of contract this summer. Calvert-Lewin, 28, has not featured since January owing to a hamstring injury and has just returned to training. But the England international did an interview with the BBC this week in which he said he would be interested in staying at the club.",
      "Moyes admits it is a tough decision on his contract owing to his fitness issues. He added: “I think when we came in we've had 10 injuries, which has really worried me. We can't be bringing in players who are not going to reliable and not going to be available so it's hugely important to the decision-making.",

      "Calvert-Lewin is back in training but is unlikely to be fit to face Ipswich. With little to play for other than positions in the table, Moyes can use the remaining four games to look at players. But he admits assessing Calvert-Lewin in this period may be unfair.",

      "Ratcliffe's attention has also been turned to Manchester United since he bought a minority stake in the Premier League side last year. Having endured a dreadful campaign, United have taken up more and more of Ratcliffe's time.",
      "With a new stadium also in the planning, Ratcliffe is now looking to sell Nice. The billionaire is looking to bring in around £213m in exchange for the club, with New York-based investment bank Lazard tasked with finding a buyer.",
      "It should come as little surprise that Ratcliffe is looking to move on from the Allianz Riviera. Just two months ago, the 72-year-old made it clear he had little interest in overseeing matters in the south of France.",
      "\"With Nice, in the French league, you can buy a club for £100million. It’s much cheaper access. But I don’t particularly enjoy going to watch Nice because there are some good players but the level of football is not high enough for me to get excited,\" he told The Times.",
      "“The best season that Nice has had is this one where we’ve not been allowed to get involved because of multi-club ownership rules. They’ve been so much better without our interference! Maybe there’s a lesson there as well, you know.\"",
      "A 'blind trust' have been operating Nice this season, with neither Ineos nor Ratcliffe having 'control or decisive influence' at the club. That was due to UEFA rules around multi-club operations as both United and Nice qualified for the Europa League.",
      "Any sale is complicated by the major uncertainty around the Ligue 1 broadcasting rights. The league's deal with DAZN has collapsed, with the streaming platform ending their contract three years early.",
      "That means that French football does not have a domestic TV deal for next season. Ligue 1 teams have even been told by the French football’s financial regulator to not include media revenue in their budget projections.",

      "Roy Keane had podcast co-hosts Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher laughing as he recounted a side-splitting tale about Ruud Gullit.",
      "The Dutch football legend - known for his illustrious career with AC Milan, PSV, Feyenoord, and Chelsea - appeared on the latest episode of the Stick to Football podcast. During the show, Keane didn't hesitate to relive a memorable encounter between the two at the 2022 World Cup.",
      "\"All the TV companies stay in the same hotel, and I bumped into Ruud at breakfast,\" the Irishman explained. \"I obviously didn't know him.",
      "\"I remember being dead polite, and he spoke to me about injuries. He asked me what was the worst injury I had. I thought strange question, but he seemed really interested. So I told him, 'Oh, my cruciate - and I had a hip operation, that set me back a bit.'",
      "\"Then I said, 'What about you?', and he went, 'I used to always get side strains,'\" recalled Keane, pointing to the side of his ribcage. \"I went, 'Side strains?', and he went, 'Yeah, you know when you're lifting trophies.'\"",
      "The studio erupted in laughter. \"You got me,\" Keane conceded, while Gullit chuckled knowingly.",
      "Now 62, Gullit is celebrated as one of the all-time greats in Dutch and continental football. Famed for his adaptability, he excelled in numerous roles on the pitch and left a lasting mark wherever he played.",
      "He earned the Ballon d'Or in 1987, the same year he made a record-setting £6million switch from PSV to AC Milan. There, he enjoyed a trophy-laden run with three Serie A wins and two European Cups, forming a legendary trio with Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard - a partnership that also propelled the Netherlands to Euro 1988 glory.",
      "Gullit later joined Chelsea in 1995, paving the way for a wave of international stars like Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli, and Marcel Desailly. Taking over as player-manager in 1996, he led the club to FA Cup glory in 1997 - the Blues' first major trophy in over a quarter of a century.",
      "Among Chelsea supporters, Gullit is still seen as a transformative figure from the pre-Roman Abramovich years, lauded for his finesse and vision both as a player and manager. That's why it came as a surprise when club owner Todd Boehly failed to recognise him.",
      "\"I think football clubs these days are run for business rather than from the heart,\" Gullit said. \"I met Todd Boehly, it was a meeting for all the clubs organised by [PSG chairman] Nasser [Al-Khelaifi].",
      "\"So I thought I'd introduce myself [to Boehly]. He asked me, 'What do you do?' I said, 'I played football, also for Chelsea.'",
      "\"He said, 'What did you do then for Chelsea? When were you there?' He didn't know! This is what it is. They don't know what the club is all about.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim admits cash-strapped Manchester United cannot afford to throw away Premier League points – because every place in the table is worth millions. United, 14th in the table, travel to Brentford on Sunday in a game they must successfully navigate ahead of Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at home to Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Although the Europa League remains their priority, with United leading 3-0 from the first leg, Amorim said they cannot afford to give up in the Premier League – with each place worth around £3million in prize money. Lifting the Europa League trophy will be worth around £100m to United, with the winners also going straight into next season's Champions League.",
      "But Amorim said he and his players cannot forget their domestic responsibilities. The United boss said: \"It's hard to separate, but we know that we always have a responsibility.",
      "\"We have always a responsibility to perform. We always have the responsibility of the results. We have to show the importance of every game at Manchester United. Then, every position we have in the Premier League, you win more money, so that's important. Then it's about fighting for your pride.",
      "\"Of course we don't have anything to fight for [in the league]. We have the second leg, which is really important for us. We know that, but we need to be competitive in every game.\"",
      "Amorim hinted at changes to United's starting XI, having heavily rotated his line-up between the two quarter-final legs against Lyon last month. \"Of course, we are in the advantage, we have our fans, but again this could change,\" he said in Bilbao.",
      "\"Anything can happen in one game. Of course, we are confident but we need to be really careful with our players against Brentford, because you can feel it. Nous Mazraoui is dead [tired], Patrick [Dorgu] is tired, so we have to manage the players.\"",
      "Amorim was able to welcome back injured duo Amad and Matthijs de Ligt as second-half substitutes on Thursday. Luke Shaw also came on after starting last Sunday's draw away to Bournemouth.",
      "\"When you see Luke Shaw playing, he's a top player and everything he does is with class and quality,\" Amorim hailed. \"He needs to push himself really hard because we need guys like Luke Shaw and then Amad is really important one against one.",
      "\"You can feel it, he doesn't yet have that explosion to go one against one but the opponent is always looking for that. Matta is really important for us. He's really fast, really strong and good in the build-up so I'm really pleased [to have him back].\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes was left asking a Spanish reporter if they knew the rules as the Manchester United skipper debated the penalty and red card decision that defined the game. Athletic Bilbao were reduced to ten men during their Europa League semi-final - which greatly angered the locals.",
      "United won their first-leg at San Mames 3-0 with Fernandes grabbing brace. The first of those came from the penalty spot as Daniel Vivian was given his marching orders for pulling down Rasmus Hojlund. Bilbao were fuming by the decision, which came after a VAR check.",
      "Fernandes was later quizzed by the Spanish press on whether he felt the red card was justified. That led to a frosty exchange with the Portuguese playmaker questioning whether they knew the rules as he explained that the grab on Hojlund left the referee with an easy decision.",
      "Fernandes began by asking the reporter if they thought it was a penalty, to which they replied: \"I think it could've been a penalty, but no it wasn't a red card.\"",
      "The United skipper then responded: \"Why wasn't it a red card? Do you know the rules? If he tries to tackle with his feet, it's a yellow card. If he pushes him or does it with his hand, it has to be a red card.\"",
      "Fernandes refused to be drawn on a potential handball from Alejandro Garnacho in the build-up, but also claimed that the Argentine himself should've had a penalty later in the game. The Portuguese star confessed that talk of the referee is a big deal in Spain and his homeland.",
      "However, after spending five years in England, the United man has changed his approach. He said: \"I'm in England and my mind has changed a long time ago and I'm not going to do it. The referees are like us, they make mistakes, but I don't think he made a mistake today.\"",
      "Fernandes produced a beautifully composed finish to score the third for the English side. He's now approaching 40 goal contributions this term having scored 19 goals and provided 18 assists and wants to put the pressure on himself to contribute in the final third.",
      "He said: \"I want to score, I want to assist. It’s a big part of my game, I need to take that responsibility because I know since I came to the club, and even before, the club bought me because I scored 32 goals in one season. They knew I could create, I could score, and I just need to keep delivering, because if you want to be at the highest level, you have to keep delivering.\"",

      "Asked if winning the Europa League would save United's season, Maguire said: “It wouldn't save the season, because I think it's been disappointing. There's been too many games that we've lost and we've been far too inconsistent.",
      "“It's been a bit of a mess in the middle of the season. The transition period, we didn't handle it well enough as players. We didn't take the responsibility well enough, from moving manager to manager and we took too long in embedding into new ideas.",
      "“It's been a difficult season, it's been a disappointing season, but football is about memories, it's about creating memories, it's about winning trophies and we have a great opportunity to win a trophy. For our fans, for what they deserve, so that's the most important thing.”",
      "“I think we've put ourselves in a great position,” said Maguire. “There's no doubt about it, coming here and winning 3-0. It's a great position and now everyone expects us to be in the final.",
      "“So we've just got to prepare well. We've got to prepare like it's still 0-0 and go into the game being aggressive and play on the front foot. We'll be going into that game trying to win and that's the mentality we must have because we're at Old Trafford and playing at Old Trafford demands winning football matches.",
      "“We know they could score first, but we've got to remain calm. We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments - Casemiro, Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Maguire has enjoyed a remarkable renaissance at United after hitting rock bottom, with a series of high-profile mistakes costing him the captaincy and casting doubt on his Old Trafford career.",
      "But the England defender has emerged as one of United's best players in an otherwise wretched season, although he does not count this as his best campaign since joining from Leicester for £80million in 2019.",
      "“No, I wouldn't say it's my best season at the club, if I'm being honest,” said Maguire. “The first two seasons, coming into a team that finished seventh the year before, I think we kept the most clean sheets in Europe and finished third the second season.",
      "“Then we finished second, so I think those were my two best seasons at the club, form-wise, although, I must say the big moments this year for sure have been a lot better than in previous seasons.”",

      "The Brazilian winger has often been described as one-footed, much preferring to play with his left during his disastrous two-and-a-half years at United. But Antony gave his critics food for thought after his powerful strike.",

      "Although he signed a new contract in February, that deal contains a £62.5million release clause and United are pushing ahead with a move for Cunha as Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim looks to revamp his squad.",
      "\"Amazing player,\" Strand Larsen told talkSPORT when asked about Cunha. \"Hopefully we can keep him for a long time, but you know how it works. A player like him, scoring goals, giving assists, having great games, it's difficult to keep, obviously.",
      "\"But he's such an amazing guy off the pitch and then on the pitch. You can all see it. I don't need to tell you anything. He gives passes you can't really see. My goal last weekend [against Leicester ], it wouldn't happen if his pass wasn't really, really top.",
      "\"So yeah, amazing player and hopefully we can enjoy more of him. But I can imagine there will be a lot of interest, yeah.\" Strand Larsen's comments come after fellow Wolves star Matt Doherty claimed Cunha deserves to be \"playing at the highest level imaginable\".",
      "\"That's not the case but I'm pretty sure he's going to be playing at the highest level imaginable – Champions League, stuff like that – pretty soon. Huge, huge potential.\"",
      "Cunha has publicly stated that he wants to leave Wolves this summer, telling the Guardian in March that he wants to \"take the next step\" and \"fight for titles\". He said: \"I had a lot of offers [to leave in January] but I wouldn't feel well if I had done it.",

      "\"He's been sensational tonight. He has been so disciplined. People have been talking about getting rid of him, his legs have gone... But I tell you what, he's come to the fore when they have needed him.",
      "\"He's coaching this team through this and it's a massive moment in the season for them.\" Casemiro initially struggled for game time under Amorim, who suggested back in January that the Brazilian could no longer cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.",
      "\"Sometimes it's a lot of that. It's also a player's moment. We understand that Casemiro has other things nowadays,\" Amorim said. \"The intelligence he has, understanding the game, understanding where the ball is going to fall but we're in a league that I can see, even in European competitions, the difference in intensity is big.",
      "\"And so, I feel that this team also needs players with a very high intensity. And sometimes we don't have that and sometimes that difference in characteristic can lead one player or another to play.",
      "\"Even the fact that the group has a certain characteristic as a group. I needed some players in certain positions with a slightly different pace. But we all know the quality Casemiro has and everything he won. And so, I have nothing to say about that. It's just a choice.\"",
      "And when asked about his future in March, Casemiro said: \"It's too soon to talk about next season, but of course I have another year of contract and then an option. We have important games...",
      "\"It's too soon to talk about next season. I'm here, I'm available, with total happiness, and I'm ready for the coach and the club. As everyone knows, I'm a big character for the club.\"",

      "As evidence of just how unexpectedly smoothly things went for Manchester United in Bilbao, witness the sight of Matthijs de Ligt and Amad coming off the bench to begin their return to match fitness after a spell on the sidelines.",
      "De Ligt got as routine a 25 minutes in the centre of defence as it's possible to imagine in a Europa League semi-final, easing his way back in after a month out, while Amad played the final six minutes plus stoppages after returning from almost three months out with an ankle problem.",
      "Both were spotted in full training for the first time at Carrington on Wednesday and were included on the bench at San Mames, but Ruben Amorim could never have imagined the first leg of this tie would go so well that he could get minutes into both. With more than one foot now in the final on May 21, Amorim will be hoping to have both available to start back in Bilbao.",
      "That shouldn't be an issue for De Ligt. There are places up for grabs in defence, and he would start ahead of Victor Lindelof from the team that began on Thursday. The 25-year-old has to have a chance of starting at Brentford on Sunday and aiming for an hour at the Gtech Community Stadium, which might be enough to see him start against Athletic at Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "There will be a little more caution with Amad, whose absence from training has been longer. He was initially ruled out for the season after suffering an ankle ligament injury in training, but that was soon downgraded, and he should now have an excellent chance of starting United's biggest game of the season.",
      "The question might be where he starts. Having begun life under Amorim as a wing-back, Amad was moved into a No. 10 role and thrived there from mid-December, with the head coach keen to utilise a left-footer in one of those attacking positions.",
      "But Amorim has struck on a nice balance in the Europa League, and the four midfield positions arguably pick themselves now, with Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro deep and Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho as No. 10s. It's hard to see any disruption to that, although Amorim could opt to replace Garnacho with Amad.",
      "Maybe the more likely route into the team is that Amad returns to his wing-back role, and he could be the perfect replacement for Diogo Dalot, who is injured at the moment and will face a battle to return in time for the final. Noussair Mazraoui has filled in for Dalot, but it is Amad who will offer far more attacking thrust down the right.",
      "Amad has shown he is a capable wing-back and a far more attacking option than the dependable Mazraoui. It would mean two left-footers in the wide roles, with Patrick Dorgu on the other flank, but Amorim has been happy to field that kind of combination previously.",
      "It might also be a chance to trial Amad in that position ahead of next season. As good as he has been as a No. 10, United have a surfeit of players fighting for those positions, and Matheus Cunha's expected arrival will only add to the backlog.",
      "At wing-back, the competition isn't as fierce. With Geovany Quenda now set to sign for Chelsea, it could mean Amorim either looks for an alternative signing in that position or uses Amad there more regularly. He has the versatility to play as an attacking midfield one week and then at wing-back the next, with Dalot remaining a reliable option as well.",
      "Having Amad back is going to be a significant boost for United. Had he not suffered that injury when at the peak of his powers this season, he could have been challenging Fernandes for player of the year honours.",
      "As it is, his return will give Amorim a second game-changing starter and in a final that could make the difference. Amad has proved he can do just that, whether he starts as a wing-back or a No. 10.",

      "It is often said that good things come in threes, and that was definitely the case for Manchester United at the San Mames Stadium on Thursday night.",
      "Not only did they take a huge stride towards the Europa League final, beating Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in the first leg of their semi-final showdown, but they also welcomed Matthijs de Ligt and Amad back from ankle injuries.",
      "De Ligt, who replaced Harry Maguire after 65 minutes, had missed the last six games and Amad had been unavailable for almost three months. He got six minutes under his belt, replacing Patrick Dorgu late on.",
      "By the time both players had stepped onto the pitch, the contest was as good as over. United's three-goal blast in the last 15 minutes of the first half had put the contest beyond Athletic, who will travel to Old Trafford next week facing the steepest of uphill struggles.",
      "But before United and head coach Ruben Amorim can give any thought to the return leg with the Spanish outfit, they must navigate their way through Sunday's Premier League clash with Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. Just like last weekend's trip to Bournemouth, it feels like another meaningless away day.",
      "However, given the tight turnaround time between the trip to Bilbao and the trip to the capital, the clash with the Bees is likely to be a big occasion for some of United's fringe players and youngsters.",
      "Despite taking a 3-0 aggregate lead into next week's second leg with Athletic, Amorim should be wrapping the vast majority of his main men in cotton wool on Sunday and saving them for the main event four days later. It has already been confirmed Noussair Mazraoui will play no part.",
      "The likelihood of Amorim rotating his pack will almost certainly see the likes of Harry Amass, Luke Shaw, Christian Eriksen, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount drafted into the starting XI. There is also a chance that De Ligt and Amad will start after making their returns via the bench in the Basque Country.",
      "Amad was a strong contender for the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award prior to his injury, excelling following Amorim's appointment as head coach in November; his first 20 appearances under him yielded six goals and six assists.",
      "With United currently looking a strong bet to reach the Europa League final, Amad will want to play his way back into contention for a regular starting berth. He will only strengthen those aspirations by playing.",
      "If he is fit enough to start on Sunday, it would be no surprise to see him start as the right-sided No.10. After initially operating at wing-back under Amorim, he was moved into a more advanced role to give United a left-footed presence in that area.",
      "With Amad potentially taking the right-sided No.10 spot, Mount could be in line to occupy the opposite berth. He is yet to find any sort of rhythm since recovering from his latest injury, meaning Amorim, who is a huge fan of his, should give him the opportunity to try and flex his muscles against the team he has scored his only United goal against.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund led United's attack in Bilbao and, in Amorim's opinion, had his best game since he replaced Erik ten Hag. He is the club's only available striker for the Europa League amid Joshua Zirkzee's absence through injury and Chido Obi's ineligibility, meaning he should be rested against the Bees.",
      "With that in mind, there has never been a better opportunity for Amorim to give United's fans what they have been waiting for and give Obi his full debut. The talented 17-year-old has made six substitute appearances since making his debut in February, with his last two cameos in the Premier League amounting to 35 minutes.",
      "The youngster has been excellent for the Under-18s this term and has looked sharp when given opportunities from the bench by Amorim, meaning he has worked his way into a position where he is ready to secure his first start in senior football.",
      "The prospect of him leading the line and being supported by Amad and Mount would, of course, mark the birth of a previously unseen United attack, but it would be one worthy of experimenting with with the pressure off.",
      "United supporters are drooling over Obi's potential, while they have also been wowed by Amad's improvements under Amorim. With full focus on the second part of the Europa League semi-final, Amorim can afford to play around this weekend.",

      "United have not won in the league since mid-March when they ran out 3-0 winners at Leicester City. The Reds have since failed to win in five matches, drawing two and losing three games in that sequence.",
      "While United will be keen to record a positive result at the Gtech Community Stadium, Amorim's squad will also no doubt have one eye on the Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club. With this in mind, it could be a difficult task to get something at Brentford, as Amorim looks to rotate his pack.",
      "Here is the latest news and transfer rumours from Old Trafford;",
      "United are \"prepared\" to exercise Franco Mastantuono's £38million release clause, according to TYC Sports. The 17-year-old has been impressive since breaking into River Plate's first-team.",
      "Mastantuono made his senior debut in January 2024 and he then became the club's youngest ever goal-scorer the following month. The teenager has promptly established himself as a firm fixture in the first-team set-up, and made 41 appearances throughout his maiden season.",
      "He has since continued to shine in 2025, having netted three times in 12 matches this year. And Mastantuono, who is claimed to be attracting interest from across Europe, saw his stock rise even further when he netted a superb 30-yard free-kick for River against arch-rivals Boca Juniors on Sunday.",
      "United are understood to be interested in snapping-up Mastantuono and he could prove to be an astute addition as Amorim tries to strengthen his squad this summer.",
      "MEN says: Mastantuono is one of the most talented South American youngsters around, right now, and it's no surprise that he has been linked with a summer move to Europe. He has been excellent in the Argentine Primera Division and it does feel like an astute piece of business if United can get a deal done.",
      "Would £38million be too much? For a player of his potential and for one that hasn't played outside of Argentina? Perhaps, but that is the type of money you've got to pay now for an elite talent, who also has the potential to be world-class. Should United get into the Champions League, it's a move that could be worth the risk.",
      "United are hoping to get between £34million and £43million in order to sell Antony this summer, according to El Chiringuito TV.",
      "The Brazil star, who has spent the second half of the season on loan at Real Betis, has scored six goals and added four assists in 19 matches since joining the La Liga club.",
      "Although Betis want to sign Antony on a permanent deal at the end of the season, they could be priced out of a move. That is because United want in the region of £34million to £43milllion to sanction his exit.",
      "And as Betis might not be able to afford Antony, fellow La Liga outfit Atletico Madrid are reported to be \"in pole position\" and it's claimed that Diego Simeone's side have \"asked\" about the 25-year-old.",
      "MEN says: Antony has been excellent since his move to Real Betis and it's a not a shock that Manuel Pellegrini's side want to sign him on a permanent deal. While Betis might not be able to afford him, there are clubs across Europe and Spain that could, such as Atletico. As he has proved that he can perform in La Liga, it's a transfer that Atletico should attempt to make, as he would strengthen their forward line.",
      "Looking at this from United's point of view and their lack of potency across the front three, it would be simple to suggest that he could come back and replicate a similar level of performances, but I think that the Reds should cut their losses and cash in on the Brazil international.",

      "Spurs, who themselves have endured a terrible season in the Premier League, are currently 3-1 up against the Norwegian side. Ange Postecoglou's men raced into a 3-0 lead but Bodo/Glimt added some nerves in north London with a late consolation meaning the tie was far from over.",
      "United, however, haven't beat Spurs since March 2022, failing to win in the last seven fixtures. This season, Tottenham have defeated United on three different occasions, it's fair to say that the north Londoners have been a bogey team for United.",
      "Fortunately, United have their own advantage and it may come as a shock. Casemiro's resurgence in recent weeks has made Amorim's job so much easier with the Brazilian improving drastically. Against Bilbao, the midfielder was brilliant, adding a goal to his all-round performance.",

      "Under Erik ten Hag, United paid £70million for his services and throughout his time in England, he's been slammed and criticised for not being at the required level. Recently, he has performed when needed and his track record of performing in Spain could give United an advantage over Spurs in a potential Europa League final.",

We just shrug our shoulders.",

      "Two years after Manchester United signed a goalkeeper, a playmaker and a striker they are set to sign a goalkeeper, a playmaker and a striker.",
      "Ruben Amorim let it be known less than two months into his tenure he was keen on a new goalie. Andre Onana is expected to have stiffer competition, at the very least, next season.",
      "Altay Bayindir, a frugal £4.3million signing on transfer deadline day in September 2023, will be sellable and Tom Heaton is considering retirement. United could end up needing two new custodians.",
      "Inter Milan sold Onana to United for £47.2m and replaced him with Yann Sommer from Bayern Munich for a cut-price €6.5m a month later. Inter are two games away from a second Champions League final in three seasons. Onana, perhaps wistfully, often dines at the San Carlo Italian restaurant in Hale.",
      "United had bigger priorities in Erik ten Hag's first summer in 2022: a defensive midfielder, a right winger, a centre back, a striker they never got. Ten Hag's perception of David de Gea evolved over their season together. Parting with nearly £50m for a 'keeper who left Ajax at the same time as Ten Hag was still a luxury the United manager should not have been afforded.",
      "Ten Hag tried to make a midfielder out of Mason Mount and gave up after one season. Well, 20 games. Mount is still an appearance shy of the amount of matches he appeared in last term.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal were both circling for Mount and he would have been better suited to either of those clubs than United. Mount does his best work off the ball and was always going to be wasted in central midfield.",
      "He started this term as United's No.10 and that did not last long. Mount was substituted after 58 minutes in the Community Shield, hooked on 61 minutes against Fulham and forced off after 45 minutes at Brighton.",
      "Mount has been involved in team training for six weeks and his last start remains the Manchester derby on December 15. Amorim wants Matheus Cunha and Cunha wants United. Amorim has expressed his \"love\" for Mount but their working relationship is yet to blossom.",
      "It made this week's timing of a rare Mount interview with the United website convenient. Mount has been unusually shy nearly two years on from his move to United and had to be persuaded to speak to MUTV during the pre-season tour in Los Angeles last year.",
      "Mount was initially sensitive about further upsetting Chelsea fans. That was nearly two years ago. Onana has had enough torturous days to make most goalkeepers reclusive and he often fronts up. Perhaps too much sometimes.",
      "After his clanger against Bayern Munich at the start of last season, Onana informed his teammates in the dressing room that he would speak to the press. They told him he did not have to. \"No, I'm going out there. I'm doing it,\" Onana replied.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund stopped in the mixed zone after he scored against Leicester City last month. A colleague sympathetically suggested to Hojlund that he lacked service. Hojlund rejected that and accepted sole culpability for a run of 21 games without a goal.",
      "A senior figure at United, no longer at the club, claimed the club tracked Hojlund when he was in Denmark and followed him to Sturm Graz. They were intrigued to see how Hojlund would fare in Serie A with Atalanta as \"the Austrian league is s***e\".",
      "That was a curious choice of words. The Austrian league is not going to be a winner for ratings but it has spawned goalscorers Erling Haaland and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Hojlund's adaptation under Gian Piero Gasperini, Atalanta's esteemed coach, offered United encouragement. United upped their interest in Hojlund around Christmas time. Ten Hag held video calls with Hojlund as summer loomed.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain were monitoring Hojlund and Randal Kolo Muani, but so were United. Muani was discounted as United had doubts he would adapt to the Premier League and he tended to drop deep, whereas Hojlund was a purer No.9. Hojlund was also four years younger.",
      "The then-United football director John Murtough left United's 2023 pre-season tour after the Houston leg to conclude a deal for Hojlund. There had been a £42.8m bid from PSG.",
      "Murtough spent more than 12 hours at Atalanta's training ground. Two days after PSG's take-it-or-leave-it offer, United agreed to pay £21.2m more for Hojlund. Up front.",
      "A lot doesn't add up in the Hojlund deal. United claimed Atalanta's opening negotiation price was £90m. An external source says Hojlund was being touted for £23m to West Ham United at the start of 2023.",
      "People at United enthused that Atalanta thought that they had got a bad deal. Atalanta won the Europa League without Hojlund last season and Ademola Lookman plundered a hat-trick in the Dublin final.",
      "United felt Ollie Watkins was understandably overpriced at £65m-£70m. Evan Ferguson, still goalless on loan at West Ham from Brighton, was in the mix back then but Brighton had no plans to sell after the sales of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo.",
      "Liam Delap partly appeals to United as he will have a release clause. Ipswich cannot fleece them like Atalanta, Chelsea and Inter Milan did.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Atletico Madrid have enquired about Antony's availability, according to reports in Spain.",
      "The Brazilian has found a new lease of life in LaLiga after joining Real Betis on loan during the January transfer window. Antony has been a standout performer, impressing to the point that Betis are now keen to make the move permanent.",
      "Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has already dropped a major transfer hint about the 25-year-old. \"It is a source of satisfaction on a personal level [to have brought Antony to Real Betis], but it is the result of teamwork,\" he said.",
      "\"Although I am responsible for the sporting management, there are many people involved in this signing. It’s still early, but we will try in different ways to do everything possible to continue enjoying Antony.\"",
      "Manager Manuel Pellegrini also voiced his satisfaction with the winger. \"I see Antony very involved in the team, in the group, in the institution,\" Pellegrini said. \"We would all be happy if he stayed, but now we have to focus on the present.\"",
      "But it now appears that Antony has caught the eye of Atletico. Speaking to El Chiringuito TV, journalist Marco Benito confirmed the interest.",

      "He may be a surprise option, but the Frenchman has seen his role diminish under Diego Simeone this season. Despite starting 27 LaLiga matches, he hasn't scored since early February, when he netted in a 2-0 victory over Mallorca.",

      "It could have been another night of frustration for Rasmus Hojlund. After one shot out of Manchester United's 25 at Bournemouth at the weekend, he didn't get a single shot away at San Mames, despite his team racking up 14 attempts at the Athletic Club goal.",
      "Despite the blank, Hojlund would have left the game feeling pleased with his work, and he soon had praise from Ruben Amorim ringing in his ears. The 40-year-old said it was the Danish striker's \"best game\" since he was appointed head coach.",
      "In a way, Amorim's praise for Hojlund's performance reveals a lot of what he wants from a No.9 in his 3-4-2-1 system. He praised his ability to make the runs and secure the ball, which is something Viktor Gyokeres excelled at when he played under Amorim at Sporting.",
      "Yes, the Swede is a prolific goalscorer - albeit in a much easier league - but he could run the channels to always give Sporting an out ball, and he could use his pace and strength to hold the ball up and bring others into play.",
      "Beyond their Scandinavian backgrounds, Hojlund and Gyokeres share obvious similarities. Both are well-built and can be powerful and pacey runners. What they don't share at the moment is that eye for goal. Hojlund has just two goals in his last 30 games for United.",
      "But in Bilbao, he turned in a performance that was full of stature, at the very least. United scored three times, could have had more, and the attack clicked. Hojlund held the ball up superbly, and when he does that, his ability to link play and bring others into the game is excellent.",
      "He showed that side of his game against Lyon as well and looks so much more assured on the European stage than he does in the Premier League. He arguably sums this United side up. Pussycats in the Premier League but transformed in quality and confidence when the continental opposition rolls into town.",
      "Hojlund's stats contrast sharply between his struggles in the Premier League and his better performances in Europe, including in last season's Champions League. He has 10 goals in 19 appearances in Europe, from an xG tally of 7.8, and those 19 games have yielded 31 shots.",
      "In the Premier League, the 22-year-old has 14 goals from 59 appearances, but those 59 games have resulted in just 63 shots. The difference is pronounced.",
      "Hojlund certainly doesn't lack for confidence, and his social media posts have occasionally rubbed United fans up the wrong way. But he is self-aware, too. After breaking his goal drought against Leicester City, he didn't hide behind his lack of service and said he needed to improve, but there was also a forthright assessment of how he believes he can thrive under Amorim.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Bruno Fernandes talk about Hojlund at Bournemouth last weekend, when he suggested the striker needed to work on his attacking runs and make better decisions depending on who was on the ball. Fernandes also pointed out that the goalscoring had to be shared around. It was in Bilbao, but Hojlund's work helped in that regard.",
      "His run into the six-yard box, which resulted in the penalty being awarded and Dani Vivian being sent off, was aggressive and full of intent. He forced Vivian to take drastic action by showing the pace and power to get in front of his marker. Had he not been fouled, then maybe he would have scored.",
      "There is no doubt Hojlund needs to add more goals to his game, especially in the Premier League, but his European performances have proved there is a good forward there, if not a £64million one.",
      "But those displays only add to the conundrum around United's No.9 and many of the squad in general. Why can't they translate this form to domestic matters? It's a question Hojlund himself might struggle to answer and one that, ultimately, might have already cost him the role as first-choice striker next season.",
      "Even if a replacement does come in, Hojlund's Old Trafford career might not be over. He has been linked with Napoli and a return to Serie A, but Amorim's praise suggests he still believes he can fit this system. If United are in next season's Champions League, they will need depth, and Hojlund could offer just that.",

      "Up against the meanest defence in Spain, United took full advantage of Dani Vivian's first-half red card. Goals from Bruno Fernandes (2) and Casemiro mean that United are highly likely to grace the San Mames turf again later this month.",
      "Having shown tremendous character to come back against all odds and knock Lyon out of the Europa League at the quarter-final stage, it was widely expected United would face their sternest test yet in the competition in the form of Athletic.",
      "They had finished second in the league phase, beaten AS Roma and Rangers in the first two knockout rounds and had won all of their first six home games in the competition this term. Inaki Williams' header after 11 minutes was a warning sign that they were in the mood to make it seven wins out of seven on home soil.",
      "But after United, who were sloppy in the opening exchanges, got themselves in front via Casemiro's header after half an hour, there was no turning back for Amorim's troops.",
      "Following Casemiro's opener, Bilbao were reduced to ten men just five minutes later when Dani Vivian was sent off for pulling Rasmus Hojlund back when he tried to reach a low cross inside the six-yard box.",
      "The opportunity to go 2-0 up on the night and in the tie was too good an opportunity to pass up. After being taunted by the Bilbao fans during the time it took for the referee to review the incident and then deal with the inevitable protests that followed his decision to dismiss Vivian, Fernandes kept his cool to slot the ball home.",
      "All of a sudden United were 2-0 up. Nobody had anticipated that scoreline after 37 minutes.",
      "However, the incident that led to the penalty being awarded came from Noussair Mazraoui's decision to gamble on getting forward. He went on the overlap, was found by Alejandro Garnacho and the cross was put into a perfect area.",
      "Had Hojlund not been dragged to the turf, he would have almost certainly made contact with the ball and doubled United's lead.",
      "United have continued to slowly get to grips with Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system in recent weeks, with the performances of their wing-backs becoming more valuable. Prior his current absence through injury, Diogo Dalot had made positive strides in his quest to adapt to his game as a wing-back and Luke Shaw's decision to go on the outside of Fernandes in the closing stages at Bournemouth led to him providing a cross that turned into a goal.",
      "Following Amorim's appointment in November, United made the addition of a natural wing-back their leading priority for the January transfer window. Patrick Dorgu arrived from Lecce with less than 48 hours of the window remaining and he has offered glimpses of what he can bring to the table.",
      "Despite the up and down nature of his performances, which are to be expected of a 20-year-old still adjusting to life in a new country and at a club where every move is scrutinised, Dorgu has demonstrated that he can provide the attacking thrust and athleticism United need in the wing-back department.",
      "He is constantly trying to get into advanced positions and occupy a high position on the pitch. Up against the speedy Inaki Williams in Bilbao, that was not always going to be easy.",
      "But just as Mazraoui did, Dorgu got opportunities to get up the pitch and support United's attacks. Of course, both players' chances of getting forward were aided by Vivian's red card which opened up spaces for United to attack.",
      "United pushed for a fourth goal after half-time and the closest they came to wrapping up the tie once and for all was when Casemiro headed against the post from a corner. Prior to that, a low cross from Dorgu narrowly evaded Garnacho on the stretch.",
      "Dorgu created the chance as a result of making an overlapping run that was spotted by Fernandes. It was another example of one of the playmakers being supported by one of the wing-backs sprinting forward.",
      "United, despite being on the brink of another Europa League final, do remain a work in progress. However, patterns of play involving the wing-backs are becoming all the more frequent.",

      "\"For United are going to Bilbao\" was the soundtrack to watching United in Bilbao. But they will be back. Surely even the modern-day Manchester United and their astonishing commitment to the banter era can't blow this?",
      "So commanding is this position after a first leg of scarcely believable comfort in the Basque Country that fans would have been flocking to familiar travel websites to book up flights and hotels for a return later in May.",
      "That will be an unpalatable occasion for the locals, who were left with a seething sense of injustice at the way events unfolded in the first half of the first leg at San Mames. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play a European final in your home city.",
      "Athletic are a unique club in so many ways, including how they celebrate. This is the club that parades a trophy by floating the players and the silverware down a barge on the Nervion river that runs through the city. Their chances of winning a trophy this season have capsized.",
      "It looked like being a different story as United rode out a shaky opening 20 minutes. They were poor in possession and committing sloppy errors inside a deafening San Mames.",
      "Then the game turned, and it turned thanks to three players who have been crucial to this Europa League run. Casemiro scored the opening goal and was outstanding once again in a European game.",
      "Bruno Fernandes now has six goals and an assist in five knockout ties. His penalty was nerveless after such a long delay, and his finish for his second was outstanding.",
      "But maybe the moment the game really turned was when Harry Maguire twisted one way and another, and then another, keeping the ball close and confusing his marker, creating a yard of space to send in a pinpoint cross that Manuel Ugarte flicked on and Casemiro buried. It was a moment that stunned San Mames - and plenty of United supporters - and 15 minutes later they were out of the tie.",
      "It was another moment that made you think something is building for United in this competition this season. It's never a wise move as an elite athlete to convince yourself that destiny is on your side, but these United players must be beginning to think there is something in the water this season when it comes to the Europa League.",
      "They remain unbeaten through 13 European games this season, and although the opposition hasn't always been of a high standard, they have played Porto and Fenerbahce away in the group stage and teams from Spain (twice) and France in the knockout stages.",
      "Throughout that run, they have scored six times in the final couple of minutes of the game, including the extra-time goals against Lyon. In the knockout rounds, they have benefited from a sending-off for Real Sociedad, Lyon and now Athletic Bilbao.",
      "They were behind in the second leg at Old Trafford to Real and Lyon. Don't expect that to be the case in the semi-final. Rarely can a second leg with a European final on the line look to be so stress-free.",
      "After their heroics against Lyon a few weeks ago and that miraculous three-goal, six-minute comeback, it did feel like this might just, somehow, be United's season in Europe. What happened in Bilbao only strengthened that feeling.",
      "Amorim's side are disastrous domestically, but they have looked a different proposition in Europe. The question for Amorim to answer is whether that is because of the standard of opposition, a more comfortable pace of play, or a feeling of confidence in these games that has been stripped away in the Premier League.",
      "They haven't been faultless in this competition. There were stressful moments in Istanbul, Porto and Plzen. A disappointing ending in Lyon and a spell where the journey looked to be over in that second leg. But they're still standing.",

      "Manchester United players trained at Carrington on Wednesday morning as they stepped up preparations for their Europa League semi-final first leg against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face the La Liga high-flyers with their season now resting on success in Europe. Winning the competition would provide a route back into the Champions League and salvage something from a disastrous domestic campaign.",
      "But Athletic Club are the toughest side United have faced in the Europa League so far, and will be desperate to book a spot in a final that will be played on home soil for them.",
      "Here are some of the things we spotted from Wednesday's training session:",
      "Brentford debuts hint",
      "It was a large training group in the Carrington sunshine ahead of United's trip to Spain and it will be a larger group that boards the flight to Bilbao.",
      "As United have often done in recent seasons, the squad will stay in the Basque Country after the game on Thursday and train locally on Friday, before flying back that afternoon. That meant some academy graduates unlikely to be involved in Europe but in with a chance of playing against Brentford will travel, ready to train on Friday.",
      "That's why 17-year-old striker Chido Obi, ineligible for the Europa League this season, continued to train with the first team. He could yet get a first start for the club at the Gtech Community Stadium. Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also trained, and if they don't feature in Spain, they look likely to play on Sunday.",
      "Three players chasing a potential United debut were also involved and might have their eye on being part of events in West London. Jaydan Kamason, 18, Bendito Mantato, 17, and Sekou Kone, 19, were all involved on Wednesday, which suggests they will travel with the first team.",
      "Amorim watches Collyer",
      "Toby Collyer came out well before the rest of the first-team squad as he continued his rehab from a muscle injury with an individual session with a fitness coach.",
      "The 21-year-old went through a series of high-intensity running and mobility drills as he worked his way back to fitness, having missed a month of action with the injury.",
      "Collyer was beginning to catch Amorim's eye before his injury, and it was interesting that when the head coach emerged before the start of the session, he walked well out of his way to check in on Collyer and see how he was getting on.",
      "Key men return",
      "There was plenty of high jinks at the start of training as the players gathered in the sun and the whole group waited at the side of the pitch for everyone to arrive. Captain Bruno Fernandes was the last man out.",
      "The squad then lined up on either side to create a tunnel for returning players Matthijs de Ligt and Amad to run through, while their teammates tried to slap them on the back and head on the way.",
      "The ritual has become a regular one at Carrington. It is handed out to players returning from injury and those celebrating significant club and country milestones.",
      "Wednesday certainly felt like a big day, with the return of two vital players to Amorim's squad.",
      "Unlucky Amass",
      "The majority of the opening training session again involved the rondo drills. The players were split into two groups, with two from each group going into the middle to try to win the ball. The rest of them tried to keep possession and count their passes at the same time.",
      "There is always lots of laughter as the games progress, with mistakes or interceptions drawing cheers. In one group, it was the turn of 18-year-old Amass to get some grief. One attempted pass was greeted with cries of \"unlucky Amass\" from several colleagues. It certainly showed that the teenager is now settled into that group.",
      "Not so hot",
      "The sun was baking down on Carrington on Wednesday morning, and the sprinklers kept the pitches slick - and occasionally soaked the media in attendance.",
      "But while the Brits revelled in unseasonal temperatures, the arrival of Amorim and his staff was a reminder that this is perfectly standard a little further south.",
      "Amorim and his assistant Carlos Fernandes both came in full tracksuit tops and bottoms, before Amorim eventually shed the top and went to short sleeves. Fernandes kept his on.",
      "But first-team coach Adelio Candido seemed to be feeling a chill that nobody else could detect. He went through the training session with his coat still on.",

      "",
      "Arteta and Art class…\nHaving attended Art class, I found Andy H, Swansea’s entry fairly persuasive, but I have to reject one of his premises, i.e., that Arsenal were a “pratfalling mess” when Mikel Arteta arrived.",
      "I think that Andy’s assessment of Arteta’s performance is reasonably fair in itself, but Arsene Wenger’s final league finish was sixth, not fourteenth or seventeenth. A team finishing sixth in any EPL season is hardly a team doing pratfalls. They were a club with a legendary manager who led the Invincibles and transformed English football…which, in return, grew beyond him.",
      "They had plenty of talent when Arteta arrived, if some of it had been misused. They were in no sense a mess; they just needed a new coach. Maybe they needed one a couple of years earlier, but I don’t really know, as I’m not Stewie Griffin*. Arteta has improved them, no doubt, but he hardly applied CPR.",
      "I deleted a whole nostalgic paragraph about having driven for two and a half hours to see Newcastle lose an FA Cup final and Why I Don’t Hate Arsenal, but I was only belabouring things.",
      "On the other hand, five and a half years of watching Mikel Arteta at Arsenal have taught me to detest Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. I have Mailbox form here, as it were, and won’t belabour my beef either, though I will repeat that I always liked him as a player.",
      "But the fact remains that, whatever his failings, Arteta is at the very least a good coach who can really nail it against an opponent like Real Madrid once in a while. He has beaten a lot of good coaches, whatever his transfer market failures. If I were an Arsenal supporter, I think I’d be ambivalent. The wrong upgrade could be disastrous.",
      "Perhaps handing over a bit of transfer control would benefit him. Maybe he should be telling the board and Director what he wants, not who he wants, and let the scouts, the stattos and Edu go find it.",
      "All that said, my club’s won exactly one real pot in my 30 years of support, and it still feels like yesterday. Fans of some clubs think it’s an utter shambles, a travesty of justice, the end of the world when their club don’t win at least one trophy in any given season. It’s beyond me. My expectations just aren’t calibrated the way “big club” supporters I read here or in the socials.",
      "And no offense to those Gunners, but I hope they never will be. It seems to steal a lot of joy. My philosophy has always been that losing is part of sport; if you don’t know losing, what do you really know? (Besides winning, obvs.)",

      "I am oft surprised, disappointed and frustrated in the criticism Arteta receives – some of it very personal – hidden behind smokescreens of “he hasn’t/won’t win anything”.",
      "Personally, I look at last season where Arteta’s Arsenal turned in their best league points (and GD?) second only to the Invincibles. That’s pretty good, Man City were very slightly better over 38 games so they won the league. We all know Man City have been an unprecedented level of dominance in the league since well before Arteta joined Arsenal for various sporting reasons – even ignoring the 115 stuff they are strongest club by far.",
      "This season has not gone as well, not just for Arsenal but for quite a few other “big” clubs. Despite all our “Shitness”, we are still the second best team in the league and I think that gets under some folk’s skin.",
      "Anyway, regarding not winning anything – here is the exhaustive list of managers who have won competitions Arteta has not. I am excluding domestic cups and European competitions apart from the Champions League because they don’t count in these conversations. Winning an FA Cup would not change people’s position – “ah but he can’t win the league” etc…besides, just ask Ten Hag or David Moyes whether these comps are enough to keep your job on their own. Critics like to tout the cups as a stick to beat Arteta but would not allow winning them as a defense. They are very nice though but small beer apparently – so onwards!",

And Carlo Ancelotti, beaten home & away this season. I have two thoughts from this\n1. Alex Ferguson took 7 years to win his first title",
      "2. Are people biased?",
      "Here’s a test for people who think Arteta should be sacked for underperformance. Imagine Arsenal have had exactly the same results since 2019 but instead of Arteta being manager, it is James Milner (or Aaron Ramsey). Would you lay your vitriol at his feet, spit in his face?

      "Rio Ferdinand\nI don’t really like Rio Ferdinand on comms, for many reasons but you can’t question his talent as footballer. An absolute Rolls Royce of a defender. He played alongside Vidic? Yep, and they complemented each other perfectly. Rio was the best centre back of the noughties in the Premier League (lots of fashionable foreign defenders then too). Better on the ball and still less of a bellend than John Terry. He’d be equally lauded today as then if he was playing now. Ball playing centre backs are not a modern phenomenon either (Bobby Moore?). If I didn’t support United I’d say Van Dijk was better (almost as if you combined Vidic and Rio) but I do so I’ll stick by my man.",
      "I also completely agree with J. Nicholson about the embarrassment of United and Spurs pissing the Europa League. But it’s UEFA that should be embarrassed. It all started when they let runners up join the Champions League (literally adding losers ruins the name a bit). What we have now is a European Super League by stealth supported by two lesser European competitions which act as a safety net for teams like United who struggle to qualify the proper way. Much like VAR, we can never go back.",
      "And finally, there is so much nuance to some of the issues that are constantly debated in these hallowed pages and that affect our wonderful game. That nuance is above the heads of at least 50% of people that we end up in situations where trans people have nowhere to play football (or any sport really) and a young(ish) black woman loses her job for “clumsy” comments about an important issue. Aluko was wrong about Wright (I think) but the men’s game has been hostile to women (it was men that banned it for fifty years so fight me) and there is a representational imbalance which has been ignored in the fallout.\nAshmundo",

      "Let’s get this out of the way first; Rio is an absolutely diabolical pundit/co-commentator. I actually muttered “f**k’s sake…” when they announced he’d “made his way up to the gantry” 2 minutes into the game last night.",
      "However, Hartley in the Mailbox needs to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water for questioning him as a player. I’ve seen lots of great centre backs at United, from Bruce and Pallister, to Stam and Johnsen and then Vidic and Rio. Rio was the best of the lot and it’s not particularly close. Tall, quick, strong, great on the ball; I’d argue he’s the best centre back in Premier League history. Unfortunately, he became injury prone around 30 which is when centre halves often get the most plaudits.",
      "I’d argue he’s criminally underrated, and any United fan that knows their onions will tell you Rio covered up for Vidic, not the other way round. Vidic got mountains of praise because he’d throw himself in front of anything and came across as a warrior for the fans. That’s why he was loved. Rio did “merks” and missed drug tests, and generally came across as a bit of a knob.",
      "As was referenced elsewhere in the mailbox, likability is a really important factor in shaping public opinion, and no one really likes Rio, myself included, but you need to separate the man from the player. He was an absolutely top tier defender. See also, Terry, John.\nLewis, Busby Way",

      "Harry Maguire \nHarry Maguire. This man has been run through the mill.",
      "For quite a few years, he was (and still often is) lambasted in the press/social media.",
      "He has made one mistake along this whole way, and that was the Greece debacle. No one knows what actually happened other than those actually present, so its hard to give a view either way. Perhaps best to say he might have been better off getting away from it all before it kicked off, but who knows. Alcohol and youth often exacerbate things, I certainly cant throw stones from my glass house on that one.",
      "From a football perspective, he’s played the game as best he can. He can’t do any more than that. People slag him for being slow ….. well that’s just him, it’s not his fault – some guy paying £80m for you doesn’t suddenly make you run faster. But – he’s given it his all every time he steps on the pitch. He’s faced the criticism head-on and come back stronger, accepting his weaknesses. He’s accepted a new system under this new manager, knuckled down and got on with it. And for that, I tip my hat and say well played, kudos to him. Seeing him score the winner against Lyon, and then dicking all over the Bilbao fullback like a top end winger was a pleasure, and I couldnt be happier for the guy. If half the Man Utd squad had the bollocks and spine that he had, the club would be in a far better position than it currently is.",
      "A little aside on Hartley MCFC. I agree Rio is by no means the greatest commentator/pundit in the modern game. But to use that as a reason to start questioning his ability as a footballer during his career, is a little ridiculous, no? I mean, Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, saw fit to go and get him and make him the heart of his defence for 12 years.

      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s capable of playing.",
      "Amorim has at his disposal seven centre-backs at United. Currently, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof are in addition to Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Ayden Heaven, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro.",
      "However, the former pair are set to move on for free in the summer – Evans’ departure has been confirmed – so that drops the number to five.",
      "Of those five, Red Devils legend Pallister feel two walk into the side for next season, and Maguire, though in sumptuous form at the moment, is not one of them.",
      "“I’d play Lisandro Martinez as the left-sided centre-back. I would play Leny Yoro as the right-sided centre-back as he has got the pace to cover in the wide areas, and then Amorim has got a decision to make whether it will be Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt,” Pallister told GIVEMESPORT.",
      "“I think they’re both more attuned to playing in the middle of the three, because I don’t think they’re blessed with great pace, but they read the game really well, and they’re confident on the ball.",
      "“I would choose from either of them two, and then I think it’s about getting your wing-backs sorted as well. Patrick Dorgu has had an alright start and Diogo Dalot has been there for a number of years and does a good job there.”",

      "At present, it would seem harsh to rip Maguire out of the side. He has had to work very hard to get his game back in a good place, after being stripped of the captaincy by former boss Erik ten Hag and regularly being left on the bench by the Dutchman.",

They were about six minutes away from being dumped out of the Europa League in the quarter-finals when Lyon were 6-4 up on aggregate, before Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire turned the game on its head in the final few minutes.",
      "Indeed, they won 7-6 on aggregate in stoppage time, reaching the semis, where they thumped Athletic Club 3-0 in the first leg, putting themselves in a strong position to reach the final. United’s advancement in Europe will only help them in terms of transfers.",
      "According to GIVEMESPORT, they have ‘moved one step closer’ to the signing of Atalanta midfielder Ederson ‘thanks to having one foot’ in the Europa League final.",
      "Indeed, winning the competition would ‘put them in a better position to meet Atalanta’s financial demands’. The winners of the Europa League will get a boost of around £11million, and the runners-up around £6million, which would help towards any signings.",
      "Ederson is said to be a ‘serious target’, and he’s about to enter the final two years of his deal. United know the lack of a financial boost would hinder their attempts to sign him, but they are ‘confident’ he can be secured for below £50million.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has put a hugely limiting restriction on the players he wants the club to sign this summer, adding to the already ‘strict rules’ put in place by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS ahead of the major squad surgery required to prevent the Red Devils from further embarrassing themselves next season.",
      "Here are five players who ‘won’t come’ to United this summer on the basis of this new rule set out by Amorim and the five which worked perfectly for them in Ratcliffe’s first window with his hand on the tiller.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\n“I didn’t talk to him,” Ruben Amorim said when asked about United’s links with Gyokeres.”But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "We don’t know whether Amorim believes United should be exempt from the key factor which has governed which clubs top players choose to sign for over the last two decades, but if he thinks Gyokeres is somehow abnormal for wanting to play Champions League football then he’s gravely mistaken. He’s the most deadly goalscorer in Europe.",
      "It would be great if the strength and veracity of this Amorim belief could be put to the test with a phone call to Gyokeres before and after United win the Europa League final and gain entry into the Champions League next season, with the striker’s flip-flop met with contempt and a snub by his former manager in favour of a much worse striker who wanted to join no matter what.",
      "",
      "Jonathan Tah\nWith all due respect to our wonderful news editor and headline whizz Joe Williams, we’re not sure many Manchester United fans will have clicked on a link with any hope of the Red Devils pulling off the signing of Tah having read ‘Man Utd ‘actively consider’ free transfer ahead of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona’.",
      "You can ‘consider’ as much as you want, lads. That’s a four-club battle you’re not winning. Nor should they be battling in the first place. Free transfer or not, the Germany international breaks the primary golden rule set out by INEOS of not signing players over the age of 25. He’s 29 until he’s 30 in February.",
      "",
      "Patrick Schick\n‘The manager will be asked what position he wants to sign, not what player,’ the rules report claimed, and Amorim has flouted not just that directive but another by suggesting they sign 29-year-old Schick.",
      "Amorim has had the gall to ask whether the United bosses would be willing to ‘go against their transfer strategy’ to sign the Bayer Leverkusen striker as an alternative should they miss out on Liam Delap, rather than waiting for his list of three strikers to choose from, passed down from the recruitment geniuses who bought a striker last summer who’s scored seven goals in 48 appearances.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA triple whammy of rule breaks here we suspect. Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he didn’t want any ‘Galacticos’, making quite the assumption that Manchester United still have the clout to sign such players. But then again, a sojourn in the Turkish league (no disrespect) may have given United cause to believe Osimhen – whom we reckon can just about be classed as a ‘Galactico’ – would be open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But they don’t want those top tier stars, likely because of their wage demands as much as anything, with some reports suggesting Osimhen wants as much as £400,000 per week from his next club. He’s also 26 and surely has designs on Champions League football.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha\nWe can’t wait for the look on their faces when they realise 25-year-old ‘done deal’ Cunha turns 26 five days before the transfer window opens.",
      "",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has revealed that Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte were “nervous” before their Europa League clash against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Arsenal are leading the race for Manchester United-linked Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres, according to reports in Portugal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked a question which he answered while Liverpool are also pulled into the narrative as Federico Chiesa involved…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has given his view on whether Viktor Gyokeres could be tempted to move from Sporting CP to Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has reportedly asked INEOS to ‘go against their transfer strategy’ at Man Utd to sign a ‘budget-friendly’ alternative to Ipswich’s Liam Delap.",

      "Man Utd owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is thinking about selling Ligue 1 side Nice amid interest from Saudi Arabia, according to reports.",
      "The INEOS founder bought a 27.7 per cent stake in the Red Devils in February 2024 with the Glazer family handing him control of football operations as part of the deal.",
      "His first season as co-owner of Man Utd has not gone how he’d have hoped with Ruben Amorim’s side currently 14th in the Premier League after Erik ten Hag was sacked in November.",
      "However, Man Utd do still have hope of winning the Europa League after thrashing Athletic Bilbao 3-0 on Thursday night in the first leg of their semi-final.",
      "Winning the Europa League would provide Man Utd entry into the Champions League next season, which they can no longer achieve through the league, in a huge boost to their finances ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "And Ratcliffe, who also owns Ligue 1 side Nice and Swiss Super League side FC Lausanne-Sport, is looking at other ways of boosting his own finances with French media outlet L’Informe (via the Daily Star) claiming that he is considering a sale of the French side.",
      "It is claimed that the British billionaire is ‘gearing up to sell his stake in Nice as he shifts his attention’ towards Man Utd and ‘is now said to be entertaining interest from Saudi Arabia’.",
      "The INEOS founder ‘appears set to pass the baton’ with the Saudi Private Investment Fund (PIF) – who own Premier League side Newcastle – getting ‘wind of Ratcliffe’s intentions and are pondering a bid’.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Ratcliffe has owned Ligue 1 club Nice for six years but he admits that he struggles to “get excited” for going to see matches in France.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “I don’t particularly like going to see Nice because there are good players, but the level of football isn’t high enough for me to get excited.",
      "“Nice’s best season was the one we weren’t allowed to get involved in due to timeshare rules. They were so much better without our interference! Maybe there’s a lesson to be learned from that.”",
      "Despite a poor first season in charge of Man Utd, Ratcliffe backed Amorim earlier this year by insisting the Portuguese head coach is “doing a great job”.",
      "Ratcliffe claimed: “You know, you’re a young guy, you’ve come into the Premier League for the first time in your life, you’ve come in mid-season, it’s not your natural language.",
      "“You have to give the guy a bit of a break. I mean, give me a hard time, I have no problem with that. But give Ruben a break. I think he’s a good guy; he’s working hard, and I think he’s doing a great job.”",
      "",
      "Manchester United reportedly ‘hope’ that the ‘resurrection’ of Marcus Rashford at Aston Villa can inflate his price tag in the summer transfer window.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly rejected an approach from Real Betis for Antony, where he is currently on loan, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe is holding out for another deal.",
      "Manchester United chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe could reportedly look to hire Mercedes F1 engineer Michael Sansoni to improve the data situation at the club.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could yet stay at Man Utd and renew his contract with the Red Devils now willing to get closer to his demands, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are ‘confident’ that they will find a buyer willing to pay £40m for Antony in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘slashed ticket prices’ for this Sunday’s derby against Manchester City to ensure the match is a ‘sell-out’."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 12 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black.",
      "",
      "2) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +2.9\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 73.8% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "3) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.7\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "4) Kepa (Bournemouth): +2.6\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +2.4\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "8) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",
      "",
      "9) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +2.3\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled.",
      "",
      "12) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.9\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",
      "",
      "13) Alisson (Liverpool): +0.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "14) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.3\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "15) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City): -0.7\nProof, if proof were needed, that all Manchester City goalkeepers are not created equal.",
      "",
      "16) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -1.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Andre Onana this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",
      "",
      "17) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -2.5\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -2.7\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded more than Fulham this season.",
      "",
      "19) Jose Sa (Wolves): -2.7\nSaved a penalty v Leicester City to keep his seventh clean sheet of the season.",
      "",
      "20) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -3.8\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "21) Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): -6.3\nHas conceded 15 goals in his last six games and the numbers suggest he should have conceded around 11 goals. It’s been a pattern all season.",
      "Man Utd have made an ‘offer’ for Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak with the Red Devils looking to sell Andre Onana this summer, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana is reportedly ‘open to leaving’ Man Utd in the summer transfer window and there is already one club that is in ‘major’ talks to sign him.",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has ‘found’ his preferred replacement for Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana, whose ‘future is uncertain’.",
      "Man Utd could be set to rival Arsenal in the transfer market as they launch a bid to sign La Liga’s highest-rated goalkeeper.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to bring Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",

      "Athletic Bilbao were bloody poor and the architects of their own downfall, but Manchester United deserve praise for ruthlessly capitalising to win their Europa League semi-final first leg 3-0 away from home.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side have one foot in the Europa League final, winning convincingly on the same evening Tottenham Hotspur did likewise in their first leg at home to Bodo/Glimt.",
      "This means we are almost guaranteed a hilarious final contested between the 14th and 16th-best teams in England. It will be a battle for the ages, with two teams seemingly doing everything in their power to avoid winning.",
      "One advantage United have over Ange Postecoglou’s side is that the final will be played on the ground they so emphatically triumphed on Thursday night. And while Bilbao shot themselves in the foot with a first-half red card, Amorim’s men deserved the win and showed up when it truly mattered.",
      "This United team have been saving their best football for Thursday nights under Amorim, and a 3-0 win against a side who only tend to lose to very good teams (and Girona), and who had only lost twice by two or more goals all season before this, is no small feat.",
      "United started brightly but could easily have gone behind when Inaki Williams headed over with the freedom of Andre Onana’s box. The elder Williams brother had an alarming amount of space and really ought to score, with the Red Devils defence once again playing musical statues.",
      "That was the first let-off involving Williams, whose low cross was poorly dealt with by Victor Lindelof – but thankfully, the Swede was on hand to clear Alex Berenguer’s shot off the line from his own weak clearance.",
      "MORE: Man Utd send in the f***ing clowns but the clowns win anyway",
      "It was an open and entertaining game. Alejandro Garnacho – who had an early goal disallowed for offside – was terrorising Bilbao’s aging defence with his blistering pace. He’s rarely looked so dangerous, and up against 35 and 36-year-old full-backs, it was crucial he was on it.",
      "Patrick Dorgu’s speed on the opposite flank was also causing problems. Oscar de Marcos resorted to pushing the young wing-back over during a foot race he had absolutely no chance of winning at one point.",
      "Both teams looked dangerous in their own right, but just before the half-hour mark, United struck first. There were a few unlikely heroes for Amorim in what was a genuinely hilarious goal.",
      "Flying right-winger Harry Maguire was twisting and turning like a prime Arjen Robben, and his cross was reminiscent of a prime David Beckham. It was expertly turned goalward by Manuel Ugarte, whose header found Casemiro at the back post to nod in. Seriously, it was bloody brilliant from Maguire. Unironically sensational.",
      "United looked to build rather than sit, and soon had VAR checking for a penalty. Noussair Mazraoui’s beautiful low cross was dealt with woefully by Dani Vivian, who felt compelled to hold back Rasmus Hojlund rather than let him shoot – an act that seemed daft even without hindsight given Hojlund’s goal record this season.",
      "We were thinking that even before the referee brandished a red card and Bruno Fernandes stepped up to score the penalty. It turns out letting Hojlund shoot definitely was the right thing to do. Bloody hell…Vivian is supposed to be the young one in that back four.",
      "Two players were sacrificed three minutes before half-time as Ernesto Valverde desperately tried to make sure his side were still in the tie for next week’s second leg in Manchester.",
      "Unfortunately for him, Amorim’s men had enough time for a third before the break. Captain Fernandes was on hand again, calmly slotting home one-on-one with Julen Agirrezabala. Not even Manchester United can mess it up from here, right?",
      "Mazraoui struck the crossbar with a beautiful left-footed effort shortly before the half-time whistle, which came at a rubbish time for a United side in full flow.",
      "That was all she wrote in terms of goals, and taking a three-goal lead back to Old Trafford is mightily impressive. We wouldn’t be surprised if United c*ck this up, but even by their standards, that would be something special.",
      "Bottling this semi-final would officially be funnier than winning the whole thing and stumbling into the Champions League. But honestly, both are extremely amusing outcomes. The important thing is: we can’t lose from here.",

Everybody knows when you play in Old Trafford, something special can happen, but then in the next game against Wolves we create a lot of situations and we didn’t score and that confidence came down a little bit.",
      "“This season is a little bit like that. We are always searching for a great moment that can change a lot of things. We just need to be consistent. But it was a great night. In this kind of season, sometimes you have these special moments that you can take and in these kind of games, you can use that to fuel the players to do something more special.”",

      "“Even for a Spanish team, they are really aggressive on every duel. They have great players one against one. Nico Williams is a special player. They are the best defence in Spain in the league and we are not scoring too many goals so it’s going to be a tough match for us.",
      "“We know that in the beginning of the game, 20-30 minutes especially, they are really strong and intense and use the crowd to take the game to a different level and we are prepared for that, so we are going to face a very strong team.”",

Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.’",
      "",
      "It’s also claimed that United are willing to lower their demands to get Rashford off their books, dropping their £40m asking price to €35m (£30m).",
      "But there’s doubt as to whether Barcelona will take up the option, as a new forward is not a priority despite Hansi Flick admiring Rashford’s qualities.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Rashford’s main problem is his salary because United is willing to sell for a maximum of 35 million euros, a figure only understandable due to the distance between the club and the footballer. United’s idea is to sell it and save the contract it has signed until 2028. The English star is one of the highest paid footballers in the Premier League and that has made many clubs retreat due to the final amount of the operation.",
      "‘But Rashford is very clear that in the case of Barça he would press to lower the transfer or even force a loan and would put everything on his side with a salary reduction that could make him affordable for the Blaugrana club. The striker was already clear in the January negotiations that, sportingly, he fit for Barça but that the financial problems of the Blaugrana club were an insurmountable barrier.",
      "‘In Barça they have taken note, but there is no decision about it. Both the sports management and Hansi Flick appreciate Rashford’s talent, his physical power and his offensive versatility, but today it is not a priority to sign another attacker, although there is debate. The club understands that it will be possible to sign although with great economic caution and they would be advancing in other positions that would be more necessary. Everything is open because there may also be exits that will end up enlivening the market at Camp Nou.",
      "‘In fact, the sports management has detected that a good number of top-class stars are offering to play at Barça, something that has not been so common in recent years. Flick is building a winning project and Barça is now an attraction for many footballers. Deco and Flick will have a lot to choose from but the goal more to sign will be to retain the block to continue moving forward in the future.’",

      "1) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "2=) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2=) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",

      "",
      "6) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "7) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "8) PSG\nThe Champions League semi-finalists – and conquerors of Aston Villa – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side.",
      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery gave an injury update on Marcus Rashford after the Man Utd loanee missed their FA Cup semi-final loss to Crystal Palace.",

      "The last few weeks of the season are upon us and the big Premier League things – your titles, your relegations – have been settled. It’s a good chance, then, to have a look at the six permanent managerial appointments that have been made during the season to judge which worked and which were Ruud van Nistelrooy to Leicester.",
      "Ruben Amorim finding himself in the top half is genuinely wild, but while United being top half is not something the actual Premier League can deliver this season, the fact this table contains an obvious clear winner and two desperate failures at the bottom does at least tally.",
      "",
      "6) Ruud van Nistelrooy for Steve Cooper (Leicester)\nHas to take last place purely for containing every single hallmark of a panicked mid-season managerial change, plus a few new ones.",
      "Even if there were internal issues between the club and Steve Cooper, it’s pretty much undeniable that he was a manager better suited to and more likely to succeed at the unlikely task of keeping an underpowered Leicester squad’s heads above water on their return to the top flight.",
      "Given how entirely doomed they and their fellow promoted-relegated stragglers have been for months, it is absolutely wild to consider the fact they were actually 16th when they sacked Cooper. Being 16th hasn’t been enough for Tottenham to change manager for f*ck’s sake.",
      "Leicester were by no definition flying under Cooper, but they had 10 points from 12 games. They were competitive and had they managed to carry on scrambling points at that rate we would at least still mathematically have a relegation battle of some sort on our hands now.",
      "Instead, Leicester under Van Nistelrooy have done this:",
      "It’s a classic starry-eyed story of a club being enraptured by the idea of appointing as manager someone who would never have been attainable for them as a player.",
      "And then, perhaps worst of all, the idea that one of the key things that got RVN the job in the first place was a pair of victories against Leicester during his interim stint with Man United. It’s incredibly short-sighted decision-making, and also illogical: what’s the point of picking a manager on the basis of the one specific thing he will never, ever be able to do as your manager?",
      "Ruud and Leicester have now managed one win and five points in total in their last 20 league games. All of those points have come against Spurs and Brighton, which is a semi-interesting quirk at least. Their one win in over half a season being at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is undeniably superb ‘joke is always on Spurs’ action, but we’re really not sure what to make of team that could barely score in another half-season’s worth of games also picking up a pair of 2-2 draws against Brighton along the way.",
      "Anyway. Leicester are now stuck with the other problem of a star-struck mid-season appointment: a manager who we suspect has neither the inclination nor aptitude to try and get them back out of the Championship next season.",
      "",
      "5) Ivan Juric for Russell Martin (Southampton)\nIt obviously didn’t go in any measurable way well, but Southampton do at least have some mitigation that there really was absolutely nothing anybody could have done to save them.",
      "Does feel like only managing the same number of points as Russell Martin’s wilfully destructive and transparent willingness to put his own career development ahead of Southampton’s survival chances is pretty bad, though.",
      "If they weren’t going to actually get any better under a new manager, then really they might as well have stuck with Martin’s nonsense, which was at least entertaining for everyone else.",
      "And talking of sticking with a manager whose nonsense is at least entertaining for everyone else, it says something about everyone involved that the final straw for both Martin and Juric’s ill-fated attempts to stop Southampton embarrassing themselves was defeat against Tottenham. Even with potentially the worst Premier League team of all time, there is only so much that can be tolerated.",
      "",
      "4) Graham Potter for Julen Lopetegui (West Ham)\nToo early to judge, really, but that’s just as well for Graham Potter whose West Ham have been awkwardly and conspicuously bad for weeks now, and are fortunate for a couple of higher-profile catastrophes hogging all the attention.",
      "It’s a tricky one for a manager, in some ways, coming into a job over halfway through the season but with no real peril.",
      "But Hammers fans would have been entitled to expect to at least see something tangible from Potter in these last  few months to engender reasonable grounds for optimism that next season might be better.",
      "Potter looks a much better fit for West Ham than Lopetegui ever did. He was entirely the wrong post-Moyes appointment when it was so obvious that was a change that called for a clear shift in direction and approach rather than a lot more of it but with a different accent and much less Barclays knowhow.",
      "The prospect of things getting better next season remains, but it’s largely hypothetical. We have more hope West Ham will eventually be good under Potter than they ever could under Lopetegui and that flimsy guesswork is enough to lift this change into mid-table, which is something West Ham would love to happen next season.",
      "Bald facts are, though, that when you sack a manager in an unacceptable 14th place and the new one carries you to 17th it definitely hasn’t gone in any way to immediate plan.",
      "",
      "3) Ruben Amorim for Erik Ten Hag (Man United)\nStill enormous potential for this to go down as one of the single greatest bungled managerial appointments of all time, and thus entirely hilarious that it actually sits in the top half of this season’s permanent manager changes. Which does rather suggest that mid-season managerial changes are pretty hard – although as the next two names on the list confirm not in any way impossible – to get right.",
      "Clearly what elevates Amorim here – beyond the sheer abject and consistent sh*tness of the names below him – is the increasingly ridiculous name-on-the-cup stylings in the Europa League. Had they gone out to Lyon as all logic insists they should, then there would be a case for Amorim being bottom of the pile for sheer This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About-ness.",
      "Amorim has been too stubborn and wedded to his way with a squad that is ill-suited to it. He is one of several managers at several clubs enormously lucky the bottom three are what they are and thus the unthinkable idea of actual relegation has largely remained exactly that.",
      "But United have been relegation-fight bad for a long time now. Having contrived to somehow neither back nor sack Erik Ten Hag after his FA Cup win, forcing him to survive a mortifying job-review process that came to the wrong conclusion and then giving him another couple of hundred million to spend on players he wanted by way of apology, United lose more points here for this being a managerial change that happened in mid-season at all.",
      "If Amorim was their man in November after United’s entirely predictable choppy start to the season, there is absolutely no reason at all why he couldn’t have been their man in the summer.",
      "Amorim himself, knowing the sort of manager he is and how wedded to his system he is and seeing the squad United possessed, should also have called United’s now-or-never bluff. For such a seemingly assured and charismatic character, it betrayed a surprising lack of confidence; that this United job at this time was a job opportunity he couldn’t turn down lest it be the last such offer he received.",
      "It was never, ever going to be that when he had Sporting playing the kind of eye-catching football that well-drilled and well-suited group of players were producing.",
      "READ: Slot to Leeds, Amorim to Liverpool, Howe to Celtic: Premier League manager near-misses",
      "",
      "2) David Moyes for Sean Dyche (Everton)\nAnd now, at last, we get to changes that have absolutely been good ones. Sometimes a manager and club just fit. Sometimes a manager and club just understand each other perfectly and it’s all just… right. Moyes and Everton are one such combo. He knows them, they know him.",
      "And while Moyesball may never have been quite aesthetically pleasing enough for West Ham tastes, it is never quite as performatively, defiantly drab-at-all-costs as Dyche’s when things aren’t going well.",
      "And things were not going well. By the time Dyche was sacked in early January, Everton had won just four matches in all competitions all season long. Moyes managed that in his first joyous, mood-transforming month at the club he served so well for so long in his first spell.",
      "In that giddy spell between mid-January and mid-February, Everton did this:",
      "That springiest of new-manager bounces has dissipated slightly in a flurry of draws and now back-to-back defeats to Man City and Chelsea but it doesn’t really matter.",
      "Moyes’ first job had been done. Lift the sombre mood, give Everton fans a precious half-season of relaxed certainty about the club’s Premier League status and above all the chance to give Goodison Park a celebratory farewell that didn’t involve eight games of chewing fingernails to the quick before staying up on the final day.",
      "Bigger challenges await with the move to that spectacular looking new stadium next season, but those challenges can now be met with positivity and hope, two things Everton have lacked for the longest time.",
      "",
      "1) Vitor Pereira for Gary O’Neil (Wolves)\nEven Martin Samuel must surely now accept that although Vitor Pereira is a foreign and thus to be viewed with suspicion he has delivered more than a ‘small improvement’ on PFM Gary O’Neil’s effort in leading this Wolves squad to 19th place and five points from safety in the first half of the season.",
      "For a hint at the scale of Pereira’s achievement, it’s worth considering that O’Neil and Martin were both sacked on the same day with Wolves and Southampton the bottom two and separated by four points.",
      "Here’s what the table looked like then.",
      "Here’s what it looks like now, with Wolves 30 points clear of the stricken Saints.",
      "O’Neil managed nine points from his 16 games; Pereira has 32 from his 18. For what it’s worth, that’s a point-per-game of a tick under 1.8 and would be enough to have Wolves second by an admittedly impossible half a point had it been replicated across the season as a whole.",
      "Only Liverpool, Newcastle, Arsenal and Man City have more points than Wolves since Pereira got involved and they are currently the in-form team not just in the Premier League but across the continent’s major divisions. It’s entirely fair to say theirs was a squad that should never have been in the mess O’Neil got them into, but the way in which Pereira has got them out of it is nevertheless astounding.",
      "We have spent much of the last few weeks idly wondering what the media coverage of this might have looked like had O’Neil and Pereira’s roles been reversed.",

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "Stream the Premier League and more with NOW",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",

      "Friday 2 May 2025 12:47, UK",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim admitted \"nobody expected\" the magnitude of their 3-0 Europa League semi-final first leg win at Athletic Club but insisted the tie was still not over ahead of next week's return match.",
      "His side became only the third to win at San Mames since August and inflicted the joint-biggest defeat on their hosts at the stadium in over a decade, putting one foot in the Europa League final at the same stadium later this month - where they look likely to meet Premier League rivals Tottenham.",
      "United weathered an early storm from the hosts but took the lead through Casemiro's header, and then played much of the game with a man advantage after centre-back Dani Vivian conceded a penalty and was sent off for pulling back Rasmus Hojlund in his own box.",
      "Despite scoring three goals in the final 15 minutes of the opening period, the one criticism of the visitors' performance was that they did not manage to add to their advantage and kill off the tie as a contest.",
      "Man Utd are the only remaining team unbeaten in Europe this season, in stark contrast to their Premier League campaign where they have lost 15 of 34 league games - but even so, the head coach had not been expecting such an emphatic victory in the Basque country.",
      "\"It's the best result because nobody expected this result,\" he said. \"But you saw two games today - the first 25 minutes and then, after the goal and the sending-off, the game changed.",

      "\"In the first 30 minutes, they had chances to score. If they score, it's a different game. When we scored, we felt more free to play.",
      "\"It's hard to understand but sometimes it's the context. We can win this competition. In the Premier League, we are suffering game after game. We try to manage both things with some injuries. Sometimes it's hard, even for the players.\"",

      "Of 133 previous first-leg away wins by three goals in European knock-out ties, all 133 teams have progressed to the next round.",
      "But Amorim told TNT Sports: \"We had the chances to score one more, but this is not done. The same result can happen at Old Trafford, and we need to be prepared.\"",
      "Hojlund could not add to the last-gasp equaliser he netted at Bournemouth at the weekend but did put in a strong shift leading the line for United, proving an agile target man while also showing far better positional awareness than he has in recent games.",
      "Amorim has kept faith with the beleaguered striker through his prolonged struggles this season, in part due to a lack of senior alternatives, and gave him a vote of confidence following his performance in Thursday's game.",
      "\"It was the best game he had with me as coach,\" he said. \"He helped the team a lot. He secured the ball and made runs. It was a good moment for him but like Harry (Maguire) he needs to understand everything can change so let's focus on the next one. This one is in the past.\""

      "Thursday 1 May 2025 19:46, UK",

      "United travel to Bilbao on Thursday for the first leg of their Europa League semi-final against Athletic Club.",

      "Should United stay in 14th, it will be their worst top-flight finishing position since the club were relegated in 1974. However, despite the club's second-ever Europa League trophy being up for grabs, for Mainoo, the disappointment of their league displays will linger.",
      "\"It'll definitely give hope for us to take something positive into next season. The season's not gone how we would have liked it to, but we can't just be down and all fall apart, because then where do we end up?
