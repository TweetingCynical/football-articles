      "Under fire Postecoglou is widely expected to leave the club this summer following a shambolic domestic campaign in which they have lost 21 of 37 league games.",

      "Mount has just four goals and one assist in 44 appearances for United since he joined the club from Chelsea in 2023, yet three of those strikes have come this month. He netted twice in the win over Athletic and his recent performances have shown glimpses of what United invested in.",
      "His problem has been injuries, with calf and hamstring complaints ruling him out of 50 games altogether since he arrived at Old Trafford. But the 26-year-old does look at ease playing as a No.10 in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and could be a key player in Bilbao.",

      "While some transfer targets will prefer to wait until they know the result at San Mames, we've already seen some movement on at least one deal. United signed Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven at the end of the winter window, but this summer could end up being a great deal busier.",

      "Matheus Cunha has shown his motivations by agreeing to join Manchester United without knowing if they will be in Europe next term. The Brazilian is poised to join from Wolves in a deal worth north of £60million, having added a release clause when he signed a contract extension at Molineux earlier in the season.",
      "Cunha only got a limited taste of Champions League football at his previous clubs. He played twice in the competition for RB Leipzig and 10 times - mostly as a substitute - for Atletico Madrid, but missed out through injury when Atleti knocked United out of the competition in 2022.",

      "Gary Neville has claimed that Manchester United need to acquire \"six players minimum\" in the summer transfer window should they hope to have any chance with success under Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils legend, who spent the entirety of his career at United, has never been one to shy away from giving his analysis of his former club since stepping into the world of punditry.",
      "And the former right-back, who became all but part of the furniture at Old Trafford, has now noted that it would be unfair to judge Amorim's capabilities just yet, despite the Red Devils staring down the barrel of a dismal finish in the Premier League at present.",
      "That's because Neville understands that the Portuguese tactician has been forced to work with the squad that he inherited from Erik ten Hag after stepping up as his successor in November - a crop which doesn't exactly cater to his patented style of play.",
      "Speaking to The Athletic, Neville said: \"What they need to do now is to create some stability. There has been a lot of instability off the pitch in respect of the non-playing staff and there has been a lot of instability on the pitch with the changes of manager and changes to the squad.",
      "\"That has got to stop at some point and they’ve got to embed in Ruben’s team, let them develop. I think this time next year we’ll know a lot more, when we see whether Ruben can build a successful team.",
      "\"Christmas next year we’ll know a lot more, because I think Ruben needs to get that second transfer window. He needs a proper pre-season with the team to embed this system and this style of play.",
      "\"We’ll know a lot more in October, November, December when I’m sure they’ll be winning more matches than they are now.\" In terms of discussing a ballpark number of players needed, Neville added that United need at least six players for the best chance of success going forward.",
      "He added: \"It needs a big overhaul in the summer. Five or six players minimum to be able to change the direction of how he wants to play.",
      "\"There’s at least two forwards, a central midfield player, definitely two wing backs and another centre-back. They need six players minimum.",
      "\"Ruben has been very good at identifying the players he wants out of the club; that’s really clear to everybody. The club’s job now is to get them out and get replacements in that he likes and wants in his team.\"",
      "It's been a sad state of affairs for Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson departed the club back in 2013, with a string of world class managers trying, and failing, to fill his boots with domination of the Premier League. However, if there's any hope that Amorim will fare better than David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, or Ten Hag, then it is clear that he will need time and investment.",
      "However, the United board may struggle to finance such a lavish shopping spree for Amorim so soon, with minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe telling The Times earlier this year: \"This summer we will ‘buy’ Antony, Sancho, Casemiro, [Lisandro] Martínez, [Rasmus] Hojlund and [André] Onana and they’re all about 17 million quid each.",
      "\"Because that’s what is outstanding. If we buy nobody else we’re buying those players. But it will be a very profitable club. We believe that in three years’ time it will be the most profitable football club in the world.",
      "\"And it will be in a very, very different place. But we need to go through the change.\" The club could only afford to bring in Ayden Heaven for just north of £1m and Patrick Dorgu for £25m in the January Window, and players may need to be sold on should the board hope to have any wiggle room in terms of incoming players."

      "Wolves manager Vitor Pereira has admitted that he doesn't know if Matheus Cunha is joining Manchester United - but is convinced he remains committed at Molineux. Cunha has been strongly linked with a big-money move to United when the summer transfer window opens, yet has continued to play for Wolves in recent weeks.",
      "United are desperate to bring in attacking reinforcements this summer, with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee having struggled to find the back of the net. Cunha is expected to leave Wolves for Old Trafford, with the club also pursuing Ipswich Town star Liam Delap in a £30million move.",
      "The Brazilian forward has a £62.5m release clause, which was written into a new contract that runs until June 2029 amid interest back in January. He has scored 17 goals and provided six assists in 34 games for Wolves this season and is understood to be sold on joining United, even if they lose the Europa League final and fail to qualify for the Champions League next season.",
      "United and the 25-year-old have agreed on all but the finer points of his move, and the Red Devils are also working on the structure of the deal with Wolves. But speaking ahead of Wolves' match against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Tuesday night, Pereira kept his cards close to his chest.",
      "\"I have the same information as you, I really don’t know!\" he insisted when asked about Cunha. \"I just know he is my player, he is committed with the team, he is working with happiness and we will see what happens.\"",
      "When pressed on whether Cunha wants to stay at Molineux, Pereira added: \"You must ask him, but I feel he is happy.\"",
      "While he has impressed on the pitch, Cunha has had a tumultuous campaign off it, having clashed with Wolves fans online and served a four-game ban for clashing with Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez. He made it clear he wanted to leave Wolves in January before signing a new contract which at least ensures his club will be compensated this summer.",
      "\"I've made it clear that I need to take the next step,\" he said. \"I want to fight for titles, for big things. I have potential.\"",
      "For his part, Amorim has remained quiet in public about the pending transfer, which could go through shortly after the window opens on June 1. “I will not say nothing about Matheus, because if I say I have to say 'yes' or 'no' and not comment on that,” he said last month.",
      "“We have to focus on this season and the way we prepare for next season could change in these games, so it's difficult to predict what can happen in the future.”"

Cunha has enjoyed a superb season with Wolves to help them avoid relegation, scoring 15 times in the Premier League. That has included three goals and two assists in his last six games.",
      "There are a number of teams who were credited with an interest in the 25-year-old in January, including Arsenal and Nottingham Forest, but United are now firmly at the front of the queue and are edging closer to sealing his transfer.",
      "United and Cunha have agreed all but the finer details on a package to take him to Old Trafford. The question is how and what exactly they will pay Wolves, with an agreement there not yet in place.",

      "Rolfes went on to say that Leverkusen are in the 'final stages' of deciding on Alonso's successor. \"I believe we'll wrap this up in May,\" he added. \"We're in the final stages now, and it will definitely happen this month.\"",
      "Last week, Fabregas revealed that he has spoken to other clubs but is happy to continue at Como, the club he part-owns, so long as everyone is 'aligned with his ideas.' \"I talked to the club, we made progress, I am happy here,\" the 38-year-old said.",
      "\"I want to understand if everyone wants to continue like this and they are all aligned with my ideas. I also spoke to other clubs, I am respectful and speak to everyone. There is to be an official announcement. I am happy, we all need to be on the same page to continue together.\""

      "Manchester United's transfer business has come under scrutiny again as some of their star men thrive out on loan. Antony and Marcus Rashford aren't the only ones enjoying a new lease on life away from Old Trafford, though.",
      "Last summer, United cashed in on Aaron Wan-Bissaka after triggering a one-year contract extension. They took a huge hit on the former Crystal Palace man, recouping less than a third of the £50million they paid for him in 2019.",
      "The 27-year-old had ups and downs at United, but has wasted little time impressing in his new surroundings. He has even scored two goals for the Hammers, matching his tally from 190 games at his previous club.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has been rewarded for that fast start by winning the Hammer of the Year award. Previous winners of the award - handed out to West Ham's player of the season - include current captain Jarrod Bowen and former skipper Declan Rice.",
      "The news hasn't escaped United fans, who have spotted a pattern of players improving after leaving the club. Scott McTominay is on the verge of a Serie A title with Napoli and Antony has reached the Conference League final with Betis, while Rashford's form for Aston Villa leaves them in with a shot of another season in the Champions League.",
      "\"Everyone that has left man united recently has turned into a goat,\" one fan wrote on social media. \"It’s not the fact that we sold him. It’s the fact we sold him for pennies compared to what he’s worth,\" was the verdict from another.",
      "\"Always saw the value of the Spidey,\" another United fan said. \"He was our best fullback who is clear of [Diogo[ Dalot and even [Luke] Shaw on a good day.\"",
      "Wan-Bissaka helped West Ham complete a first league double over United since back in 2006-07. He played the full 90 minutes in both games, a 2-1 home win in October and a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford in May, setting up a goal for Bowen in the latter.",
      "Upon joining West Ham in August, Wan-Bissaka explained his decision to move was an easy one. \"It was a no brainer for me to join West Ham – I’m excited and happy to be here,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s an amazing feeling to be back in London, and I’m excited for what’s coming. I was born here, so I know the ins and outs of London, which plays a big part in my life, so to be back playing in this city means a lot to me\"",
      "United managed to soften the blow by signing Noussair Mazraoui in a similar cut-price deal, with the former Bayern Munich defender impressing in his first season at Old Trafford. Even so, there are plenty who have been left frustrated that Wan-Bissaka was unable to build on his early Palace promise in a United shirt."

      "The Europa League final could be missing up to 13 players with both Manchester United and Tottenham juggling some serious injury woes. The victor will land themselves a spot in next season's Champions League, but selection may prove difficult.",
      "Ange Postecoglou knows he will definitely be without James Maddison. The playmaker scored in the semi-final victory that landed Tottenham their place in Bilbao. He was also on target when the north Londoners beat United earlier this season, but he'll miss out through with a knee issue.",
      "Dejan Kulusevski is another major absentee for Tottenham - his injury was confirmed recently and will deprive Postecoglou of one of his major attacking weapons. Radu Dragusin and Lucas Bergvall are also sidelined, as is loanee Timo Werner. Dane Scarlett, who has only just begun featuring in the first-team, is also denied the chance of playing in the final.",
      "Ruben Amorim's two major misses have long been on the casualty list. Lisandro Martinez's knee issue has sidelined him for a lengthy period whilst a thigh problem has kept Joshua Zirkzee out.",
      "Beyond that the United both is sweating on several issues in his backline. Matthijs De Ligt is struggling with a knee and Leny Yoro hobbled off in the loss to West Ham eight days ago. Amorim said on the defensive pair: \"I don't know if they're going to be available, we'll try to push, it's a final, all the players want to play really bad.\"",
      "Diogo Dalot's calf needs to be monitored but the defender said \"so far so good\" whilst Jonny Evans, albeit way down the pecking order, wasn't in the squad that headed to Chelsea on Friday.",
      "Tottenham are hoping for some good news regarding Pape Matar Sarr, who walked down the tunnel with medical staff against Aston Villa on Friday. \"Pape felt something in his back, so we took him off as a bit of a precaution,\" Postecoglou said afterwards. \"I don’t think it’s anything too significant, speaking to him afterwards but he just felt something in his back.”",
      "Tottenham have already beaten the Manchester outfit on three occasions this season - twice in the league and once in the Carabao Cup. However they are looking to end a trophy drought that dates back to 2008 and has hung over the club throughout that time.",
      "United meanwhile have continued to be dire in the Premier League and have lost six of their last eight games. Amorim can restore some pride with victory on Wednesday night, but has already claimed his side are \"not ready\" to be competitive domestically and in the Champions League."

      "Amad strides towards us with his hand outstretched. We shake hands and there is a spare chair behind him.",
      "Does he want to sit down?",
      "“No, it’s okay.”",
      "Amad has stood up and been counted plenty of times for Manchester United in what is effectively his first full season. Had he not succumbed to injury in mid-February, the Sir Matt Busby player of the year statue might have had a new home away from the Fernandes residence.",
      "We are speaking on the concourse of the Stretford End, doubling as a mixed zone on United’s Uefa media day for the Europa League final. It was at that end that Amad attained cult status with his Old Trafford winner for the ages against Liverpool in the FA Cup.",
      "That still did not signal a turning point. The 22-year-old had to wait until the home defeat to Arsenal in May last year to start a meaningful match for the club he signed for in October 2020. Before then, Amad had been restricted to three starts in heavily-rotated teams under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Ruben Amorim is Amad’s fifth manager and the one who has maximised him. Ruud van Nistelrooy merits a special mention for his management of Amad during that four-game caretaker stint in the autumn.",
      "The image of Van Nistelrooy avuncularly putting an arm around Amad’s shoulder on the touchline in Istanbul sticks out. Amad had watched Erik ten Hag put Antony on ahead of him against Fenerbahce.",
      "“I need the game time to show I can play for this club,” he says. “In that moment, I was a little bit frustrated because you can understand sometimes maybe you deserve to play and you don't play. You have a little bit of frustration.",
      "“But I think now it's because the manager believes in me. He believes in my potential. I'm trying to repay his confidence every time I'm on the pitch.",
      "“Honestly, Erik helped me a lot. He was giving me a lot of advice, even when I wasn't playing. He was telling me to train very hard every time. That's the most important thing when a manager keeps telling you to train hard, even if you don't play.",
      "“So I kept training very hard, very hard. I think this season, at the beginning, I was playing a lot with him. I want to thank him again for the opportunity he gave me and I want to wish him all the best.”",
      "Amad was a one-man band in attack before he sustained an ankle injury in training in February. He was pressing Andre Onana and his left foot remained entrenched in the turf when he attempted to turn.",
      "He reflects on the two-and-a-half-month lay-off positively. Amad required surgery and “kept praying to be back before the end of the season. So this happened and now I'm happy.",
      "“I'm always positive, I'm always smiling with everyone, so that's my natural thing. That's me, that's Amad, so I always try to grow up with positive things.”",
      "His development at United was interrupted by significant injuries. A thigh strain prevented Amad from joining Feyenoord on loan in August 2021 and a knee injury sustained in the pre-season win against Arsenal in July 2023 kept him out for five months. Amad left the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on a golf buggy clutching crutches.",
      "He returned to United that summer as a cult hero at Sunderland. On Tuesday, he was back at the Stadium of Light, where he was paraded during the interval of Sunderland’s Play-off tie with Coventry City.",
      "United’s former football director John Murtough was convinced that Amad needed ten successive starts to demonstrate his qualities. During his first ten-match starting streak with Sunderland, he tallied six goals.",
      "“I believe in my potential,” Amad stresses. “I believe I can be one of the best in the world. I just have to give my best every game. That's it. But I think I believe in my potential.\"",
      "Back in the United States with United in the summer, his stock was so much higher United chose him as the player to chair a press conference. Amad’s English has improved since then and he is not as shy.",
      "His social media persona suggests he is more extroverted than his softly-spoken nature suggests. “UNITER WILL NEVER DIED,” he tweeted from the dressing room after the mother of all Old Trafford comebacks against Lyon. “Congrat manu (Ugarte) for your’re s**t goal, f**k Garna for that miss, you gaves us pain heart.”",
      "Someone asked if it was Amad’s actual account. “No, Amorim account,” he dryly replied.",
      "“I was so happy,” he laughs. “Honestly, I'm a good guy with everyone. I just posted that tweet on my X. That was funny, no?",
      "“We are really close. We are really close with Garna. Kobbie, Leny, everyone. I have good relationships with everyone. Like I said before, I have good energy, good vibes. Everyone likes to be with me.”",
      "And it’s definitely him tweeting? “Yeah, it's me, it's me. Nobody (else), it's me. It's Amad!”",
      "The Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur will be Amad’s third. He was an unused substitute in penalty shootout defeats with United in 2021 and a year later on loan at Rangers.",
      "Although his transfer to United was agreed on deadline day in October 2020, Amad arrived in Manchester in January 2021. He had a virtuoso stint in the Under 21s before Solskjaer gave him a handful of opportunities. He scored an adroit header on his third appearance against AC Milan.",
      "During the unsuccessful shootout against Villarreal in Gdansk, Amad could be seen praying. “Yes, I already lost two. I hope to win this one. I keep praying for that one. It will be really good for me, but also for the team because at the end of the day, we want some things at the end of the season.",
      "“I was on the bench. I was young. I had no experience, but it was a good experience for me to be in my first Europa League final with the team. At the team, we had great players like (Paul) Pogba and (Edinson) Cavani. It was a dream for me, honestly.",
      "“But now it's my moment. It's the moment for the club, it's the moment for the players, for everyone, for the fans because they deserve this moment. We will give everything, we will give our best to try and win this competition.”",
      "Amad has lined up on the wing and as the No.10 in his two starts since returning from injury. He seems likely to line up in the latter role in Bilbao.",
      "“Honestly, I don't have a preference,” he insists. “I'm a player who likes to play, and I'm available for every position. So if the manager prefers to put me as a right wing back, I will be more happy to play there or Number 10. I have no preference. I just want to follow the manager and his system.",
      "“The difference as right wing back (is), because you have to track back, you're a defender. You're more defender, and also you have to attack. Number 10 is more as a forward player. The difference is only this one, but I'm available for everything.”",
      "He will be denied a reunion with his former Atalanta teammate and schoolmate, Dejan Kulusevski, who underwent surgery on his patella last week. “Tottenham, even without Kulusevski, they are a really good team,” Amad cautions. “So we are not here to think about Kulusevski. But Kulusevski is a good player.",
      "“Kulusevski and Tottenham, they are really good. So I want to wish him good luck. But we are here to focus on what we can do.”",
      "Rather than be sat on the bench, Amad will be stood on the pitch for this final."

      "After Dean Henderson remained at Sheffield United for a second season-long loan, he immediately embarked on a pre-season beep test. He came first.",
      "Henderson was not lording it, though. The Sheffield United manager, Chris Wilder, was absent from the pre pre-season and Henderson was on the blower to him immediately, imploring him to get the outfield players in ship-shape ahead of the club’s first Premier League campaign in 12 years.",
      "That sounds like Henderson, a violet that does not shrink. It was in keeping with his bolshy personality that Henderson revelled in the post-match confrontation with Pep Guardiola at Wembley on Saturday. “You got your ten minutes,” he quipped, holding out both hands in case Guardiola hadn’t heard.",
      "Joe Hart has a lot to answer for. Henderson, Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale, England’s three main goalkeepers, are all kindred spirits. They are vocal, expressive, impetuous and more cocky than confident.",
      "Henderson, unlike Pickford and Ramsdale, now has a winner’s medal. His performance in the FA Cup final was career-defining. There was brilliance with the denials of Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush but also that rashness when he carried the ball out for a corner and patted it away from outside his area. He fortuitously avoided expulsion.",
      "Henderson travelled to Wembley with United for the League Cup final against Southampton in 2017. He was involved in the warm-up but back in his Paul Smith suit for the dressing room celebrations, clutching a bottle of beer. He had a taste for success, and got his hands on the trophy, but did not get a medal.",
      "Nick Cox, the head of the Manchester United academy, was quick to congratulate Henderson at the weekend. “Well played Deano. Once a red always a red,” he posted on Twitter.",
      "The United academy is quick to pat itself on the back. Their blueprint for Henderson was immaculate: loans at National League, League Two, League One, the Championship and in the Premier League before United gave consideration to installing him as their number one.",
      "When Henderson joined Stockport County in early 2016, some of his teammates in the United academy derided him for stooping to non-league football. His adviser assured him they would not have a career in the game. Henderson was shortly recalled amid injury to David de Gea and on the bench at Shrewsbury Town in the fifth round of the FA Cup.",
      "Shortly after he joined Grimsby Town later that year, Henderson informed the Grimsby Telegraph he intended to become the best goalkeeper in the world. He was 19.",
      "That fourth-tier loan stint was compelling enough for Shrewsbury Town to recruit him on loan in 2017. Henderson saved his first penalty at Wembley in the League One Play-off final.",
      "Carelessly, United had allowed Henderson to enter the final months of his first professional contract in 2018. A bump in pay and a loan to Sheffield United safeguarded their investment. Luke Shaw’s sister, Nicole, was present for Henderson’s contract signing as part of work experience with the Stellar agency. It was the first of three new deals in successive years.",
      "Jose Mourinho liked the cut of Henderson’s jib, so much so that he felt he was the best 'keeper at United when Mourinho was manager of Tottenham. United, though, were in the midst of negotiations for a new contract for De Gea in the summer of 2018. De Gea’s feeble performances for Spain at the World Cup in Russia marked the start of a gradual decline.",
      "Even after De Gea renewed in September 2019, United had a loose succession plan: let Henderson get a top-flight season under his belt, integrate him into the squad and then promote him.",
      "United did not reckon on the indecisive Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, though. Solskjaer indicated Henderson would fly to Perth for the pre-season tour after his Under 21 European Championship commitments. The only United Henderson planned on linking up with was in Sheffield.",
      "When Henderson returned to Manchester in August 2020, he was remunerated handsomely: a £100,000-a-week contract. Chelsea offered United £40million for him at one stage.",
      "Suddenly, United had two ‘keepers on a combined weekly salary of nearly £500,000. De Gea’s form suffered amid credible competition in 2020-21 and several United players thought Henderson should have replaced him after their Champions League group stage ejection by RB Leipzig.",
      "It took a pregnancy for Henderson to gain number-one status. De Gea’s partner, Edurne Garcia, was about to give birth in March 2021 and De Gea flew back to Spain for the arrival of his daughter, Yanay. Covid-19 protocols ensured De Gea would miss at least four games. Henderson was promised a six-match run: Crystal Palace, Manchester City, AC Milan at home, West Ham, Milan away and Leicester City.",
      "He kept clean sheets in four of the games and atoned for Milan defender Simon Kjaer’s late equaliser in the first leg with a decent denial of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at San Siro.",
      "De Gea was out of quarantine and available for the Milan and Leicester ties but they were in the Europa League and FA Cup and Henderson was United’s cup goalie. After the March internationals, Henderson lined up in the home fixture against Brighton and De Gea started against Granada, clear confirmation Henderson was first choice.",
      "The man-management rotation was mismanagement. De Gea earned a start in the Europa League final yet endured the worst possible penalty-shootout, conceding all 11 kicks and then having his kick saved in sudden death.",
      "The pressure got to Henderson, too. Conscious that De Gea had a reputation for staying on his line, he charged out to the edge of the 18-yard box to punch away a cross but was beaten to it by Chris Wood. The Burnley striker scored but was flagged offside.",
      "After the season ended, Solskjaer informed Henderson he would be installed as number one. Henderson, who withdrew from England’s European Championship squad with a quad injury, attended the final, soaked up the pre-match atmosphere in Boxpark Wembley, contracted Covid and was laid low for two months. De Gea remained number one, regained form and Henderson played a meagre three games in 2021-22.",
      "Henderson visited St James’ Park at the end of that season but Newcastle United lost their nerve and Burnley’s relegation made a permanent move for Nick Pope straightforward. Henderson moved to another newly-promoted team in Nottingham Forest.",
      "United banked a derisory £15m fee, rising to £20m, from Palace in August 2023. Dougie Freedman, the club’s sporting director, was in the Old Trafford directors’ box for Henderson’s last matchday squad involvement with a club he joined at the age of 14 in 2011.",
      "By that point, Henderson was so itching to leave United permanently he was loitering around the away dressing room in the tunnel.",
      "Henderson has said he regrets a piqued interview he gave to Talksport upon his loan move to Forest. Some United fans bizarrely booed him when he returned with Palace in the League Cup last season. There was a myth that he leaked information when the finger of blame could be pointed at someone else who is long since gone."

      "After Manchester United failed to win any of their opening three matches in the Europa League this season, few would have banked on them reaching the final in Bilbao.",
      "Despite taking the lead in all of their opening three league phase outings, United amassed a paltry three points from a possible nine, drawing with FC Twente (1-1), FC Porto (3-3) and Fenerbahce (1-1).",
      "The stalemate with Fenerbahce in Istanbul left United 21st in the league phase table. It also left Erik ten Hag clinging on to his job.",
      "Alongside making an underwhelming start to their Europa League campaign, United experienced a difficult start to their Premier League season. They won just three of their opening nine matches, leaving them 14th in the table.",
      "United's ninth game of their league campaign saw them beaten 2-1 by West Ham United at the London Stadium, just three days after they were pegged back by Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.",
      "That defeat to the Hammers, which was United's fourth in their opening nine league games, marked the end of the road for Ten Hag, who was dismissed the following day, just months after Ineos decided to keep him.",
      "United, almost as soon as Ten Hag had cleared his office, were on the phone to Sporting Lisbon and attempting to convince Ruben Amorim to replace him. Despite the Portuguese chief being hesitant about moving to Old Trafford mid-season, United got their man, appointing him just four days after Ten Hag had been dismissed.",
      "As part of the agreement, Amorim stayed at Sporting until the November international break, meaning Ruud van Nistelrooy was placed in temporary charge.",
      "He won three of his four games at the helm, drawing the other, and it felt as though Amorim would pick up from where the Dutchman had left off. His short spell in charge did improve the mood in and around the club. It also saw United get their Europa League campaign up and running with a 2-0 win over PAOK at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Amorim's obsession with his trademark 3-4-2-1 system meant that teething problems were to be expected at the start of his tenure. After a solid first set of results saw United draw 1-1 at Ipswich Town, beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 and brush Everton aside 4-0, United's supporters hoped the transition to Amorim's preferred system would be seamless.",
      "Amorim's warning about a storm being on its way soon came to fruition, though, and United started stumbling. The 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium was the only highlight in a forgettable December.",
      "However, despite the disappointment and frustrations of United's Premier League form, their results and performances in Europe have seen them reach the Europa League final. Wednesday night's clash with Tottenham Hotspur offers them the opportunity to salvage something from what has been a disastrous campaign.",
      "United head into the clash with Spurs boasting an unbeaten record in Europe this season, winning nine and drawing five of their 14 Europa League matches. They won each of the four league phase matches Amorim took charge of, ensuring they finished in an automatic qualification spot for the last-16.",
      "Despite being held to a draw in the first leg of their last-16 tie with Real Sociedad in Spain, they came from behind to make light work of them at Old Trafford in the second leg, winning 4-1 to seal a 5-2 aggregate triumph.",
      "Lyon were up next in the quarter-finals and United, as we all know, made hard work of that one. After the first leg finished 2-2 in France, United were heading for the exit in the second leg at Old Trafford, trailing 4-2 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate with just minutes to go.",
      "However, goals from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire meant the Europa League dream remained alive. Maguire's dramatic header was perhaps a sign that it is simply meant to be for United in this competition.",
      "Athletic Bilbao, despite looking as though they would pose the sternest test United had faced in Europe all season, were blown away in the semi-finals. United won 3-0 in Spain and 4-1 at Old Trafford to progress to the final with a commanding 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Now, of course, they are one step away from winning a European trophy and securing a place back in Europe's premier club competition next season.",
      "Despite how poor their domestic form has been this season, supporters of other clubs in this country would kill to be in the position United will find themselves in on Wednesday evening.",
      "After the way in which this Europa League campaign started and a managerial alteration needing to be made just months into the season, United deserve credit for reaching a European final. Now they need to win it."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, May 19.",
      "The build-up, and the nerves, have begun as Ruben Amorim's men make their final preparations for the season-defining Europa League final in Bilbao. Tottenham Hotspur stand between United and a place in next season's Champions League which would be huge considering how poor this season has been.",
      "Matheus Cunha is said to be closing in on a move to United after a fine season at Wolves. Reports suggest the Brazilian is close to agreeing personal terms over a move to Old Trafford.",
      "A place in the Champions League next season would allow United to attract a better quality of player. Reports circulating around the club claim that one such target is Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez.",
      "The pantomime villain appeared to bid an emotional farewell to the home fans on Friday night after the victory over Spurs and it is claimed United have put an offer down to the Argentine, along with Barcelona. Elsewhere, the hunt for Rayan Cherki's signature is likely to intensify with the Ligue 1 season now done.",
      "It is thought the winger will be available for £19m in the summer which is considered a bargain after his output for Lyon this year. Meanwhile, the race for a striker will continue to gather pace as clubs across Europe try to add to their attack.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres continues to be linked with a move to the Premier League but his final destination of Old Trafford or Arsenal's Emirates Stadium is yet to be decided.",
      "With all this in mind, make sure to stick with the United blog below for all of the updates...",
      "Man United have held face-to-face talks with Liam Delap over a move in the summer.",
      "According to The Athletic, executives at United have held talks with the striker after he was given permission by Ipswich to travel to Manchester to hear their offer.",
      "Real Betis' sporting director Manu Fajardo has told DAZN that his club remain in close contact with United ahead of the summer transfer window as they look to keep Antony in Seville.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are willing to sell Antony in the summer as they look to raise funds for Amorim's rebuild.",
      "Yes, yes, there already have been [discussions surrounding Antony's future]. There is a close and respectful relationship with Manchester United, and we are in constant contact with them. We have been talking with them since his arrival. We have to take great care of this asset, so that big clubs and players of this calibre continue to trust us. We will give everything so that players like Antony can join our club.",
      "Man United are applying pressure on their hunt for a new attacker but a wildcard option may be about to present itself in the form of Christopher Nkunku.",
      "The Chelsea star was linked with a move to United in January but remained at Stamford Bridge. Now, Florian Plettenberg has reported the France international will leave the club this term, with a permanent exit likely.",
      "Bayern Munich are monitoring his situation but it's not advanced yet.",
      "Now then, this could be HUGE.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Man United will rival Arsenal for Viktor Gyokeres this summer despite the Gunners seeming to be the favourite to sign the striker.",
      "Speaking ahead of their Premier League clash with Crystal Palace on Tuesday night, Wolverhampton Wanderers head coach Vitor Pereira has admitted he is unsure what the future holds for Cunha.",
      "I have the same information as you. I don’t know. I just know he’s my player. He’s committed with the team, he’s working with happiness and we will see what happens. You must ask him. He is happy. I feel he is happy.",
      "It is claimed that no direct contact has been made between United and Wolves yet but that is expected upon the conclusion of the campaign.",
      "Cunha is believed to have had offers from other teams but is committed to joining United.",
      "While the news that Arsenal could be closing in on Gyokeres may be seen as disheartening, there are no guarantees that the move would pan out.",
      "His goals return is phenomenal but his only experience of regular English football was with Coventry City in the Championship.",
      "We have seen countless times before that the switch from the second tier to the Premier League and even from one country's top tier to another can be too much to bridge.",
      "Delap on the other hand is unquestionably cheaper and having performed in the Premier League for a relegation-bound side, there is every chance he could be a success in Manchester.",
      "An alternative option to Delap would be Ruben Amorim's former Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "He scored his 53rd goal of the season on Saturday as the Lisbon club beat their city rivals Benfica to the Portuguese league title.",
      "In the aftermath, newspaper O Jogo has run with the story that the 'Swede is on his way to Arsenal.'",
      "Like United, the Gunners have been long-term admirers of Gyokeres and it is claimed a £58.9m deal for the striker is all but agreed.",
      "Speaking to Suffolk News, former United man Luke Chadwick has claimed he has faith that Delap will be a success at Old Trafford if he returns to the north west in this transfer window.",
      "He's a bit of a throwback, isn't he? You saw him growing up at Man City and physically, he was always above the other players within his age group and you wondered, would he take that into professional football? He went out on a couple of loans where he wasn't fantastic and then went to Ipswich, where he's been great. You only have to look at the amount of goals he's scored in the Premier League. He seems to, particularly a few months in, have grown in arrogance – in a good way. You see him at Old Trafford (in February) and he's shoving them all over the place and he's getting stuck into it. It feels like he's at a time now where he can go and play at a top club. Unfortunately, Man United isn’t the top club at the moment, but I think bringing someone like that in would be brilliant for Man United. I think it would be a brilliant move for Delap as well.",
      "Following the expected arrival of Cunha in the summer transfer window, you feel the Reds will then shift their focus to a centre-forward.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is their top target for that position.",
      "His relatively small price tag of £30m is seen as tempting by the Reds while his age and goal return this season (22 and 12 respectively) are believed to be playing in his favour.",
      "However there was a factor which was bothering him.",
      "He looks like he’s got the attributes that Ruben Amorim wants. He knows that physically, his team are just not strong or quick enough, so Matheus Cunha is obviously athletic, and he’s got quality with 15 league goals this season. I just worry for any signing coming to Manchester United at the minute. It just feels like it’s such a bad place to go. The quality of play right now is so poor. And with Cunha, is he a centre-forward or is he a wide player? There’s no doubt that he has quality and of course, it would be nice to sign him, but I worry about where he fits in. You can sign the best three players in the world, and I think they’ll struggle coming into this team at the minute, but they’ve got to start somewhere.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves to United appears to be in motion as the transfer window prepares to open next month.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano reported on Monday morning that Cunha had 'agreed to the project' at Old Trafford and the Reds are closing in on the deal.",

      "Last week, the MEN reported that United were targeting at least three priority signings.",
      "And among them was Liam Delap.",

      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire admits he doesn't know how the supporters have stuck with them but they deserve to celebrate Europa League success.",
      "\"We know it's not been good enough this season, we take responsibility for that as players. We've had two managers and results haven't been good enough, and that's got to be down to us.",
      "\"To play in a European final for Manchester United is a huge occasion. Our fans deserve it - they've been absolutely incredible this season. I don't know how and why they're sticking with us as much as they are, because we've disappointed them so many times. But they've stuck with us and they deserve something to celebrate.",
      "\"It's going to be a great day for them, but it'll only be a great day if we go and lift that trophy.",
      "\"It's going to be a good game, a tough game, we know that Spurs will be right up for it as well, but it's one I'm looking forward to.\"",

      "Matchday for the semi-final first leg was akin to a host nation during a major tournament, only more fervent. It was a public holiday in Spain, kids were kicking balls in the streets and you had not seen so many replica shirts.",
      "Some may feel it is a travesty that Athletic have been denied a final in their own city. Yes, United are 16th and, domestically, have not been this bad since the year The Godfather Part 2 was released. Yet they did vanquish Athletic 7-1 on aggregate. They have earned their one-shot at salvation.",
      "Tottenham flew to Bilbao on Monday. United are scheduled to fly at 3pm on Tuesday. Spurs are training at San Mames whereas United will train at Carrington. Ange Postecoglou's pre-match press conference at San Mames is at 1645. Ruben Amorim is scheduled to speak at 1930.",
      "United had a meeting with Uefa about landing slots at Bilbao Airport. The airport felt tiny accommodating a couple of thousand United fans when they flew in two seasons ago and in recent months, never mind the arrival of tens of thousands of English football fans.",
      "Superstitious supporters may start to get twitchy. Have Spurs gone too early? Are United going too late? United's itinerary is in keeping with their European schedule this season: train at home, afternoon flight and evening press conference. 3pm is their usual departure time for a European away game.",
      "Their timekeeping has improved in recent rounds. In Porto, the fog that swirled around Portuguese airspace delayed United's landing slot and their pre-match press conference was pushed back by more than two hours. Diogo Dalot was excused to prioritise his pre-match meal 24 hours before kick-off.",
      "United regressed during a crammed Uefa media day at Carrington and Old Trafford last week. The player interviews were pencilled in for 1330. Noussair Mazraoui was escorted to our pen on the Stretford End concourse at 1542. Amad turned up at 5pm. With the United press department spread so thin, the chief communications officer was conspicuous by his absence.",
      "It is not overconfidence from United that they are departing 29 hours before the referee blows his whistle. Spurs have fielded shadow sides in their last two games, little more than fitness tests for Son Heung-min.",
      "It has not been an eternity since Spurs last reached a European final. Merely six years. Son is the sole survivor from that all-English non-event against Liverpool.",
      "Both clubs made it to Madrid through inconceivable comebacks. The difference for Liverpool after their recovery against Barcelona was they had been there, done that. Tottenham hadn't. So their players savoured Lucas Moura's kick past Andre Onana for as long as their delirious supporters were locked inside the Amsterdam Arena.",
      "Danny Rose clutched a bottle of beer. You knew then, 24 days before the final, that Spurs did not have a prayer. The gulf in mentality between the clubs made a sixth European Cup for Liverpool a fait accompli.",
      "Many of a United persuasion are banking on their pedigree. United's worst team in decades last season salvaged it with their greatest performance of the post-Ferguson era. The current lot are doubly worse, 16th to last season's eighth, yet plundered 19 goals in six European knockout ties.",
      "Spurs have the edge on United in goal, at centre back, full back, up front and have arguably more technically rounded midfielders. The caveat is United have the matchwinners. Amad was a one-man band in attack until injury and Bruno Fernandes picked up the baton.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt would be genuine losses and Amorim would be well-advised to pick a back three featuring one centre back. But United's centre-back losses are not as considerable as those of James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, two of Tottenham's most influential footballers.",
      "Amad and Fernandes are game-deciding players, which offsets the blunt instrument Rasmus Hojlund. United regimes past and present have recruited two 20-year-old Denmark internationals for inflated fees, deemed them to be good enough to start and neither are. Yet Hojlund and Patrick Dorgu will start in Bilbao.",
      "They will hope to have gold medals, rather than be green in the face."

      "The secret to success in Spain for Manchester United and Tottenham this week might be finding a way to raise their game beyond the levels they have shown this season.",
      "Granted, both have displayed unexpected resolve and quality to progress to the Europa League final. United's comeback against Lyon and the destruction of Athletic Bilbao were impressive. Tottenham's away wins at Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt, when everyone expected them to stumble, were very un-Tottenham.",
      "But domestically, week to week, this has been a season of generational rubbish. They will almost certainly finish 16th and 17th in the Premier League, propped up only by the relegated trio. Between them, they have lost 39 of 74 league assignments, and that tally will surely rise at the weekend.",
      "For one of these clubs, the Europa League trophy will make an appearance this week and the domestic disquiet will be forgotten. For the other, they will fall at the final hurdle in a bid to, if not save their season, then at least salvage something from it.",
      "Tottenham might be seen to have the upper hand, having beaten United on three occasions this season, two of them with Ruben Amorim in the dugout. But then, United have the trophy-winning experience.",
      "How much that counts for is up for debate. Football clubs are inanimate objects after all, but just over a year ago, United were coming to the end of their worst season in years but found a way to save their best for last. Go through the wreckage of that 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, and it's the FA Cup final performance at Wembley that stands out by a mile.",
      "The contrast from the humiliating way they won the semi-final, throwing away a three-goal lead against Coventry City, surviving an unbearably tight VAR call to lose 4-3 and then winning on penalties, to the way they outplayed and outthought Manchester City is still stunning to this day.",
      "It was a performance of poise and precision, a day when the game plan worked to perfection and a reminder of the talent within the ranks. It was by some distance Ten Hag's best day in the job.",
      "In fact, it was so good that rather than being his last day in the job, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe had planned, he earned himself another chance. The challenge of lifting this team to performances of that quality on a weekly basis was beyond him, but the squad involved at Wembley agree that it was a triumph for Ten Hag last year.",
      "He got the tone of the build-up right, inspiring players through cleverly thought-out speeches and video presentations, and got his tactics spot on, outwitting Pep Guardiola. Doing the same to Ange Postecoglou might not be the same challenge, but a final is always different for a head coach, and Amorim will have to get the tone right this week.",
      "You would wonder if some of the players had been in Amorim's ear, offering titbits on what Ten Hag got so spectacularly right last May, but then the turnover in the squad is already starting. Of the XI who started the FA Cup final, only Andre Onana and Bruno Fernandes are certain to start in Bilbao.",
      "Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot would have started but for injury, and Alejandro Garnacho is still pushing to retain his place, although a spot on the bench is looking more likely. Kobbie Mainoo has dropped out of the strongest XI, and Raphael Varane, Sofyan Amrabat, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford aren't at the club now.",
      "The four subs who came on, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, could have their say. Altay Bayindir, Christian Eriksen and Amad were unused replacements.",
      "They will all remember how they managed to lift their levels for a one-off match that was crucial to deciding the fate of the season. It put a gloss on the year and also delivered European qualification.",
      "But for that unexpected and meticulously planned victory, United wouldn't even be in Bilbao. Had they lost that FA Cup final, their eighth-place finish in the Premier League wouldn't have got them into Europe.",
      "So this journey starts back to Ten Hag's perfect week. He will be nowhere to be seen this week and could have no complaints about his sacking, but if United rescue their season again and secure Champions League football, he will have played a part.",
      "How he managed to pull off victory against Manchester City at Wembley could still be instructive as to how Amorim plots the downing of Spurs at San Mames."

      "\"Leave the football before the football leaves you. The football's left him.\"",
      "Nobody needs reminding of Jamie Carragher's words on Monday Night Football when assessing Casemiro's performance against Crystal Palace last season. Casemiro hasn't left football but he may well be leaving Bilbao with the Europa League trophy.",
      "Carragher later admitted he felt his comment was harsh and would apologise to the Manchester United midfielder if he met him.",
      "To add some context, Carragher was referring specifically to Casemiro's ability to play at the top level, of which a final in Europe's secondary club competition against a team one place above the relegation zone is not, but Casemiro's United renaissance in the Europa League cannot be ignored.",
      "After a stunning maiden season in the Premier League, Casemiro was in decline for a good 18 months. His performances in the Premier League, even over the last couple of months, have done little to suggest said decline has been arrested, but in the Europa League he has found a brand of football with the pace and intensity - or lack thereof - to remind us what a brilliant player he has been.",
      "The Brazilian did not get a kick between December 30 and January 30 as United scrambled to find a buyer for the midfielder. No joy on that front, but the United bank balance's loss has been Ruben Amorim's gain.",
      "Casemiro has been a crucial part of United's run to the final of the Europa League and his start and eventual withdrawal against Chelsea on Friday night was further confirmation of what we already knew: he will be one of the 11 lining up for the Europa League anthem in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim admitted recently that he had changed his mind on Casemiro, having started to understand the best way to utilise the veteran. His running patterns were monitored and tweaked, and United are now benefiting from his performances in the Europa League.",
      "Winning Wednesday's final and qualifying for the Champions League would net United a minimum figure of £80m and, should they do so, it's not too far a stretch to say that would not have been possible without Casemiro.",
      "United have been fairly criticised for their willingness to commit to such a lucrative long-term deal for a player who was already in his 30s when he arrived on these shores.",

      "The potential signing of the 22-year-old has already split opinion among the United fanbase.",
      "Some feel the fact he has scored 12 goals in a relegated side would suggest his tally will only improve playing in a stronger side. Yet others fear United would be signing a young forward with potential, just like they did with Hojlund and Zirkzee, rather than a more experienced forward with a number of seasons scoring goals on a regular basis.",

      "\"United have been linked with signing him and I like Liam Delap,\" Scholes said last week.",

      "David scored nine goals in Europe this season and backed that up with a further 16 goals in Ligue 1. There will be a number of clubs chasing his signature but the Canada international would represent excellent business given the lack of transfer fee involved.",
      "Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic is another option United could pursue. The Serbian international has scored 15 goals this season, having scored 18 goals the season before, but he is expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "Reports in Italy have suggested the 25-year-old could be available for £35million and that would be a bargain price for a forward with proven goalscoring pedigree.",

      "Diogo Dalot was spotted at Carrington on Wednesday, walking back to the first team's temporary quarters after an individual session with physio Jordan Reece. While his teammates were training, a topless Dalot sat down and recuperated in the sunshine just outside the hub.",
      "He then hot-footed it over to Old Trafford to speak in a ramshackle mixed zone. Dalot posed for his Europa League final portrait in one of the stadium's hospitality suites. The hunch is that he will be in Bilbao and his name on the teamsheet, filed among the substitutes.",
      "Luke Shaw was a predictable removal at Chelsea on Friday night. Having gone 14 months without starting for United, he seems assured of starting the Europa League final.",
      "Seeing out the contest in Bilbao could be beyond Shaw. That is where Dalot could come in. Shaw off, Dalot on and Noussair Mazraoui to centre back.",
      "Mazraoui will start against Tottenham Hotspur. Amorim has picked him at centre back and right wing in the past two games, weighing up where exactly to put Mazraoui. United's starting XI at Chelsea could feasibly be the same side that lines up for the unmemorable Europa League anthem.",
      "Amorim is pleased with United's preparations, if not their domestic results. \"Yes, first of all because of the feeling, I didn’t like the feeling of the last game.",
      "\"Then we have five days to prepare for the game, it’s two days to fully recover, we can see video, prepare some things one day to compete. If I put some players out, it was like ten days without a game, I don’t like that.",
      "\"I think the best way to prepare for a final when you have time to fully recover and prepare for the next game is just to compete. And we are Manchester United so we need to compete in every game.\"",
      "The five-day gaps afford United ample recovery time and rhythm. Enzo Maresca was struck by United's man-to-man aggression against Chelsea and they were competitive for at least an hour. Yet United still ended the evening with one attempt on target.",
      "Amorim has agonised over a pragmatic or proactive approach ever since his first training session with the players on November 18. Alejandro Garnacho started in his 14th successive match last week but the return of Amad and prominence of Mason Mount could reduce him to a bench berth.",
      "Tottenham are deprived of two of their most creative talents in James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. There has been chatter that Ange Postecoglou could start a conservative trio of midfielders in Pape Sarr, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, which possibly influenced the redeployment of Bruno Fernandes as a central midfielder at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Casemiro and Fernandes were paired together at Tottenham in February with Manuel Ugarte out injured. That was Casemiro's first start in 48 days and back when his selection was dreaded by United supporters. He has gone from unplayable to undroppable in Europe.",
      "Amorim has spoken before of having Amad \"closer to goal\" and it is probable he will remain as one of the two number 10s. Mazraoui is more comfortable in a back three as it is somewhat similar to right back yet is poised to continue on the right wing, possibly to adjust the balance if Fernandes is in midfield.",
      "That throws up the peculiar pick of the great survivor, Victor Lindelof. Lindelof's United career effectively ends in a week but he is set to be one of three survivors from United's starting XI in the 2021 Europa League final. Shaw and Fernandes are the others.",
      "One could measure the severity of United's decline by the possible presence of Lindelof and Harry Maguire in a 2025 final XI. Those two defenders last signed contracts with United in August and September of 2019. Maguire has earned his extension. Lindelof hasn't.",
      "No wonder eyes are peeled for Yoro and De Ligt on Tuesday."

      "Before this week's Europa League final, Patrick Dorgu will find a quiet time to pray and hope that his middle name delivers to bring him a first senior medal and provides some salvation for Manchester United's season.",
      "Dorgu, a £25million January signing from Lecce, will be playing in his first major final after becoming Ruben Amorim's first signing at Old Trafford. As a left-footed wing-back, he is a key component in the Portuguese’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "The switch to the Premier League from a Serie A side who ended up getting relegated was a big step up for the Dane, but his religion has helped him and it went under the radar in March when he asked United to add his name to the official documentation, making him Patrick Chinazaekpere Dorgu on club and Premier League communications.",
      "Although he was born in Copenhagen, he is proud of his Nigerian heritage. His middle name, which stems from his Igbo heritage from the land of his family, means God answers prayers, and he will be hoping he does just that in Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "“My family are religious and the reason they gave me that name was because of the meaning behind it,\" said Dorgu. “They told me at a young age what it meant. It comes from my Igbo heritage.",
      "“My family’s culture is something I learned about. I believe in God and I am always praying. I hope we win the final - it’s what I am praying for.”",
      "Dorgu might be a quiet presence around the United dressing room as he settles at the club, but he is multilingual. He speaks Danish and English, learnt some Italian during his time at Lecce, and speaks Ebo - a historical name from the Igbo language native to people from south eastern Nigeria - to his family, including his two brothers and two sisters.",
      "His faith might have helped him since making the move to United. Dorgu has had a mixed start to life at Old Trafford, but he knew arriving mid-season at a club having a testing campaign was going to present its own challenges.",
      "“Obviously, I came there in a difficult moment (for the team), so I knew that nothing was going to be made easy for me,\" he said.",
      "“I’m getting better game by game, getting more confident so I hope I can improve even more in the last games of this season and in the seasons to come.",
      "“It is all about working hard, looking forward, believing in the coach and the players and to improve my game. It has been difficult but I think there will be a lot of good years coming up, so we just need to stay focused and win the final.\"",
      "The Europa League final might be a contest between the 16th and 17th best teams in the Premier League, but the stakes couldn't be higher. For one of the two clubs, a dismal domestic season will be glossed over by a European trophy and a seat in the Champions League. For the other, the summer will be dominated by inquests into their worst campaign in more than a generation.",
      "United have the trophy-winning pedigree, having won the FA Cup final in similar circumstances last season, while Spurs haven't lifted silverware in 17 years. But Ange Postecoglou's side have beaten United three times this season, including twice when Amorim was in the dugout.",
      "“Spurs are a dangerous opponent. They have beaten us three times already this season, so we can’t think it will be easy,\" said Dorgu.",
      "“They have beaten us twice in the league and once in the Carabao Cup, so it will be a tough game even though both teams haven’t been playing well. We just hope that we can get the win.",
      "“It would mean a lot to me and to the club and the players. Everyone is, not angry, but disappointed about this season so if we can win the Europa League it will be a boost.”"

      "Three goals in 33 games is bad enough but Rasmus Hojlund's body language, and the unrestrained reactions of his teammates and coaches, are just as disconcerting.",
      "Hojlund was complaining to Mason Mount, a sympathetic sounding board, in the second half at Chelsea. Mount offered an encouraging pat on the head and then exited the pitch. Hojlund was suddenly devoid of an ally.",
      "At full-time, Hojlund turned to his fellow Scandinavian Victor Lindelof and was complaining about something or other. Lindelof soon spotted Jadon Sancho and was one of a handful of United players who acknowledged him.",
      "The press box at Stamford Bridge is directly behind the dugouts, separated by maybe half-a-dozen rows of spectators. Ruben Amorim was particularly piqued with a Dane, though it was Patrick Dorgu. His assistant, Paulo Barreira, was most animated with Hojlund.",
      "Another Portuguese, Bruno Fernandes, berated Hojlund in each half. After Hojlund killed an attack, there was that familiar sigh from the United supporters. It was all-too-familiar fare from a striker who is being bracketed with Garry Birtles, Radamel Falcao and Wout Weghorst.",
      "The punchline is Hojlund is certain to start the Europa League final. That could be his swansong as the starting striker for United. Hojlund was always destined to fail, by association with Kees Vos and the inexplicably exorbitant £72million fee United agreed for him at 3am at Atalanta's training ground.",
      "Amorim seriously tried to suggest he is happy with Hojlund at Stamford Bridge. \"I’m happy. Of course, all the team has to improve, but the way he runs, he fights for every ball, loses a lot of duels, wins some duels, he needs to improve the connection.",
      "\"But he is improving. I’m really happy with him, he just needs to continue working hard and better things will come.\"",
      "In his question to Amorim, a colleague remarked that Hojlund's performance \"left a lot to be desired\". Amorim was never going to dispute that.",
      "Senior figures at United are not having Hojlund. One well-placed source suggested he does not work hard enough. They can cut loose as it is well-established that Hojlund will be replaced in the summer. Amorim, though strikingly frank about United's ills, can't.",
      "The coaching staff have been losing patience with Hojlund for some time. Teammates were hesitant about passing the ball to Hojlund last season and it has been more brazen this season.",
      "Off the pitch, Hojlund is so desperate for approval he is resorting to crass captions, clearly curated by a tone-deaf social media team, on Instagram posts for the banter brigade. All he succeeds in doing is imitating Neal Maupay, one of the worst strikers to ever get a kick in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system is geared to service the striker, so he was never going to entertain the prospect of picking a strikerless team after Joshua Zirkzee was ruled out for the rest of the season last month. Amorim confirmed on Easter Sunday that it would do no good to remove Hojlund from the team. He has stuck to his guns even as Hojlund continues to fire blanks.",
      "There have been two tap-ins since then and a fine performance at Athletic Bilbao, a man light for 55 minutes after Dani Vivian tugged at Hojlund’s shirt. But the Premier League is the truest gauge and Hojlund will be pitted against Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero back in Bilbao. That could be as much of a mismatch as two bouncers turning away an underage schoolboy from a nightclub.",
      "Erik ten Hag dropped Hojlund for United's final three games last season and it was a masterstroke. United won all three, climaxing with their best performance of the post-Ferguson era against City in the FA Cup final.",
      "Hojlund came on in all three wins, scoring against Newcastle United and Brighton before a constructive cameo at Wembley. He left the national stadium that evening swigging from a magnum of champagne.",
      "Gaining the number nine shirt in the summer reaffirmed United's long-term backing for Hojlund. Perhaps things might have been different had he not pulled his hamstring minutes after scoring against Arsenal in the otherworldly So-Fi Stadium in Los Angeles. Hojlund required another scan on the other side of the Atlantic as the first was inconclusive and he was out for eight weeks.",
      "Yet Hojlund has been at United for 22 months now and his first season was creditable. It was not unreasonable to expect or aim for an improvement on his 16 goals last season.",
      "Eleven of his 26 goals have come in the Champions League and Europa League. United have a surfeit of players better suited to European competition (Zirkzee, Dorgu Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to name but four). That is primarily why their supporters have been subjected to the worst United side since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "Tommy Docherty's main recruit that summer was Stuart Pearson. A striker. Hojlund's teammates and coaches seem to be pining for a different striker."

      "Manchester United are now less than three weeks away from the start of the summer transfer window.",
      "Following a forgettable domestic campaign that could still see them finish just one place above the Premier League's relegation zone, United are in desperate need of a reset this summer to kick-start the Ruben Amorim era.",
      "United are planning to make a raft of much-needed changes during the off-season, with the upcoming transfer window marking Amorim's first meaningful chance to put his own stamp on the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Ahead of what promises to be a crucially important window for United, MEN Sport has had a look at what deals United should be striving to complete to freshen up their attacking department.",
      "With United planning for at least ten departures in this summer's transfer window, it is increasingly likely there will be more outgoings than incomings at Old Trafford.",
      "They started the process in January, allowing a cluster of players to leave on loan for the remainder of the season. The exits that were sanctioned featured the high profile departures of Marcus Rashford and Antony, who joined Aston Villa and Real Betis on loan respectively.",
      "United want to sell both players on permanent deals this summer, with it understood the club has no plans to reintegrate Rashford into Amorim's squad. He could well move abroad.",
      "Antony's performances and numbers at Betis have seen him create a market for himself ahead of the transfer window opening. He has eight goals and five assists in 23 games for the Spanish club, helping them reach the Europa Conference League final.",
      "Betis have already confirmed they hope to sign Antony again this summer, but once again on loan. It could be that another successful loan spell increases Antony's valuation ahead of the 2026 summer transfer window.",
      "However, amid the fact his current contract is up in 2027, United may not gamble on trying to secure a healthy fee for him with as little as 12 months remaining on his deal. The club does have the option to extend his stay until 2028.",
      "Jadon Sancho is also currently out on loan after joining Chelsea last summer. They have triggered the obligation to sign him permanently after guaranteeing they will finish above 15th in the Premier League this season.",
      "However, it's claimed they have a £5million clause within the deal so that they can break free from the agreement to sign him permanently. Whether Chelsea choose to sign Sancho or not, United need to bring this chapter of Sancho's career to an end after four forgettable years.",
      "Despite only being signed from Bologna last summer, United should be looking to cash-in on Joshua Zirkzee. Although he has shown flashes of promise as one of the No.10s in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, he is not a long-term solution for United.",
      "He was signed as a striker and it quickly became clear that he was not a No.9, and his tally of seven goals this season highlights that. United would have to accept a financial loss on him this summer, but keeping him beyond the September 1 deadline would almost certainly only delay the inevitable.",
      "Never have United needed a striker as desperately as they do this summer. In the Premier League, they have struggled for goals throughout the campaign and they need to upgrade their attacking options.",
      "Although links connecting United with Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen continue, Ipswich Town ace Liam Delap is currently a leading target for the Reds to strengthen their forward line. He has scored 12 goals for relegated Ipswich this season and he will be available this summer for £30m.",
      "The former Manchester City youngster is a prime target for United to bolster their No.9 options and has done very well for the Tractor Boys this season. The expectation is that he would be signed with a view to becoming United's chief striker and leapfrogging Rasmus Hojlund in the pecking order.",
      "In addition to wanting Delap, United are also targeting Wolves ace Matheus Cunha to occupy one of the two playmaker spots behind the striker. Like Delap, Cunha has enjoyed a productive season in front of goal, scoring 15 times in the Premier League and 17 times across all competitions.",
      "Available for £62.5m, Cunha is understood to be hopeful of securing a move to Old Trafford. He already operates as a playmaker in a 3-4-2-1 formation at Wolves, making him a natural fit for Amorim's system.",
      "United need to try and target Premier League proven players and in Cunha and Delap they are doing exactly that. Of course, Delap is still young and learning on the job, but the theory is that if he can get 12 goals in a team that has been relegated and struggled all season, he can improve with better players around him.",
      "No.10/attacking midfield options: Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Matheus Cunha.",

      "Greenwood, who joined the Ligue 1 club last summer, has been the subject of rumours linking him with a move back to the Premier League in recent weeks. At the beginning of this month, The Sun reported that Greenwood was desperate to return to England, particularly the north west, to be closer to his family.",
      "This was followed by The Telegraph who backed up these reports and claimed two Premier League clubs were looking at the possibility of signing Greenwood. It was also claimed that Marseille were open to selling the forward in the next two seasons.",
      "Before the game against Rennes, Greenwood admitted he was settled at Marseille and was looking forward to representing the club in the Champions League. And after bagging twice in a 4-2 victory which secured Champions League football for next season, Greenwood doubled down on his desire to stay in the south of France.",
      "\"An incredible feeling tonight. I would have liked to score a hat-trick, but well, it wasn't to be,\" he told reporters as quoted by Foot Mercato.",
      "\"The victory is still important, I feel good here, the people are incredible, the atmosphere is incredible, it's something very strong in Europe. It's going to be incredible with the Champions League.\"",
      "In another interview in the mixed zone, Greenwood added: \"Hopefully, I can keep improving with all the players and the team. It's one of the best atmospheres in Europe here. Of course, I want to stay next season.\"",
      "United hold a significant sell-on clause for Greenwood should he leave Marseille for a fee. The winger left United last summer after being suspended by the club in January 2022 amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour.",
      "All charges were later dropped and the winger would join Getafe on loan on deadline day in the summer of 2023. His permanent move to Marseille in 2024 saw United include the aforementioned sell-on clause in the deal."

      "Gary Neville insists it’s too early to judge both Ruben Amorim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe despite their poor starts to life at Manchester United.",
      "The Red Devils have the chance of claiming a trophy with the Europa League final to come on Wednesday against Tottenham, with victory also seeing them qualify for the Champions League next season.",
      "But Amorim has admitted this may be “the worst” United team in history, with his side currently 16th in the Premier League having lost 18 of their 37 games this season.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim sack calls despite ‘bonkers’ trophy chance for Man Utd",
      "There have been suggestions Amorim could be sacked or even resign at the end of the season, but Neville insists he needs time to “embed” and picked the six players required as a “minimum” this summer.",
      "“What they need to do now is to create some stability,” Neville told The Athletic. “There has been a lot of instability off the pitch in respect of the non-playing staff and there has been a lot of instability on the pitch with the changes of manager and changes to the squad. That has got to stop at some point and they’ve got to embed in Ruben’s team, let them develop.",
      "“I think this time next year we’ll know a lot more, when we see whether Ruben can build a successful team. Christmas next year we’ll know a lot more, because I think Ruben needs to get that second transfer window.",
      "“He needs a proper pre-season with the team to embed this system and this style of play. We’ll know a lot more in October, November, December when I’m sure they’ll be winning more matches than they are now.",
      "“It needs a big overhaul in the summer. Five or six players minimum to be able to change the direction of how he wants to play. There’s at least two forwards, a central midfield player, definitely two wing backs and another centre-back. They need six players minimum.",
      "“Ruben has been very good at identifying the players he wants out of the club; that’s really clear to everybody. The club’s job now is to get them out and get replacements in that he likes and wants in his team.”",
      "Ratcliffe has also endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford having taken control of football operations a little over a year ago.",
      "The British billionaire has made at least 17 mistakes in that time having embarked on a significant cost-cutting regime.",
      "And while Neville admits “two or three things have not gone well”, like Amorim, he believes it’s too early to judge the part-owner.",
      "“There’s no doubt that in the first 12 months of his ownership, there are two or three things he would have done differently,” Neville explains. “The reality is it’s such a big club, there is such a lot to do and there was so much wrong with it when he came in, I think he has got to be given some time to be able to develop a successful football club again.",
      "“It hasn’t been successful at the levels that United would want, winning Premier League titles and Champions Leagues, for 10 years — so it is a transition period where the new ownership are building new foundations.",
      "“I always say it takes three years, four years to be able to embed something and he’s only 12 months in, so we need to give him time.",
      "“They’re very much in the embryonic stages of a stadium project, a training ground project and building a new team on the pitch. To say 12 months in whether it’s going to be a failure or success is too difficult.",
      "“There is two or three things that have not gone very well and been quite unpopular, but there are also massive changes that needed to occur.",
      "“When you’re going into a club that basically has had sustained failure for 10 years and has recruited badly, you’re going to upset things along the way. You might make some decisions that ultimately are with a blunt tool, but the reality is change was required. It definitely was required.”",
      "Regarding the vital match against Tottenham, Neville added: “That game is making my stomach churn with its level of importance, to both clubs.",
      "“Not just from a silverware perspective, not just from a manager’s perspective, but also from a finance perspective; what it gives both clubs in terms of attracting players and the money that it will put into the clubs.",
      "“It’s making me a little bit sick.”",
      "Manchester United icon Gary Neville has revealed his final Premier League top-five prediction, backing one Big Six club to miss out on the Champions League.",
      "Ruben Amorim has done nothing to suggest he can turn Man Utd around, while there is some laughter and anger about Man City.",
      "Ruben Amorim will keep his job at Old Trafford even if Man Utd lose to Tottenham in the Europa League final next week, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists that he must give his players “the feeling that we cannot lose a match” rather than look to new signings in the summer.",
      "Gary Neville claims Ruben Amorim should be looking to get rid of ten Manchester United players in a huge squad overhaul this summer.",
      "Is the Man Utd axe ‘looming’ for Ruben Amorim? No, but many want you to think that. Meanwhile, Gary Neville is the king of hyperbole."

      "",
      "‘Man United could use Liverpool transfer to secure cut-price Matheus Cunha deal’",
      "First, it’s a right load of absolute bollocks; that much is clear from the headline. But we feel compelled to read on…",
      "‘Manchester United could possibly avoid paying Matheus Cunha’s £62.5million release clause thanks in part to their great rivals Liverpool.’",
      "Straight away, ‘could’ has become ‘could possibly’. All of the alarm bells are ringing.",
      "It’s clear that somebody has wilfully misunderstood the concept of a release clause. There is zero suggestion that Wolves will accept less than £62.5m for a player who is probably worth more on the open market. If Manchester United do not complete this deal at this price – and it very much looks like they will – then somebody else will.",
      "But in this alternative universe where Man Utd could get a ‘cut-price deal’, where do Liverpool come in?",
      "‘But Wolves’ reported interest in Liverpool forward Harvey Elliott may open the door for a cheaper Cunha deal. It is said that Vitor Pereira’s team are looking for a new No. 10 to fill the inevitable void Cunha’s exit would leave.",
      "‘If they do sign Elliott, Cunha would rightly point out that his team have a ready-made replacement, putting Wolves under greater pressure to sell. An opportunity could then arise for United to sign the Brazil international for a cheaper fee than his hefty release clause.’",
      "Ha. First, Wolves’ reported interest in Elliott emerged two weeks ago. Second, Wolves will sign somebody to replace Cunha – that’s how football works – so why would this particular mooted transfer prompt them to throw their hands up in the air and say ‘ah go on then, give us £40m’?",
      "It wouldn’t. We know that and we suspect that the Senior Sport Central Audience Writer knows that.",
      "He then adds in a load of guff about Wolves’ PSR issues – ‘another situation which could play into United’s hands’ – as if that would make them accept less than their player is worth.",
      "But what has really amused Mediawatch is that this Liverpool/Man Utd mash-up was written less than three hours after the very same man wrote this:",
      "‘Matheus Cunha sends wordless message* as Man United chase £62.5m transfer’",
      "Things move awful fast in this game.",
      "* Congratulations to anybody who worked out that a ‘wordless message’ is a picture.",
      "",
      "I dreamed a dream…\nIf ever there was a sign that the season is coming to a close and transfer shenanigans are about to begin in earnest, it is the return of the ‘dream shirt number’. And Mediawatch could not be happier.",
      "As usual, it is the Mirror leading the way into this arena as their take on the news that Liverpool could be about to sign Milos Kerkez is this:",
      "‘Milos Kerkez could get dream Liverpool shirt number if Arne Slot completes two transfers’",
      "You will be shocked to learn that the first transfer that must be completed to achieve this ‘dream’ is Milos Kerkez joining Liverpool. That’s pretty fundamental to the conceit.",
      "The second? Poor Wataru Endo needs to be entirely f***ed off by Liverpool in order to free up that ‘dream’ No. 3 shirt. We’re sure he will absolutely understand. Who could possibly stand in the way of a man who wants a particular number on his shirt?",
      "SportsMole then take up the baton:",
      "‘Jeremie Frimpong ‘to complete Liverpool medical on Monday’ as £29.5m right-back prepares to take dream shirt number’",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has named the “clear favourites” to sign Manchester United target Matheus Cunha amid Arsenal’s ‘late’ hijack attempt.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s anticipated move to Manchester United is edging closer, though the deal could reportedly hit a total of €80million (£67.2million).",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Manchester United are ‘closing in’ on their first summer signing ahead of next season.",
      "Man Utd’s board have a huge job on their hands this summer, with significant changes required to ensure they improve on their shambolic 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The Red Devils could still finish 17th in the Premier League, while they also came up short in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",
      "Despite this, a massive positive could still come from this season as Ruben Amorim’s side face Spurs in the Europa League final on Wednesday night, with the trophy, Champions League football and an injection of cash up for grabs.",
      "United desperately need this prize money as it’s been widely reported that INEOS are working with a restricted budget and could have to sell to buy.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd appear to have the financial muscle to complete one or two deals in the early stages of the summer window, with eyes on Wolves standout Matheus Cunha.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim sack calls despite ‘bonkers’ trophy chance for Man Utd",
      "The Brazil international features in our Premier League team of the season as he’s shone in a struggling Wolves side, grabbing 15 goals and six assists in the league.",
      "Cunha would fit perfectly into Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation and it’s been widely reported that he is among Man Utd’s top targets.",
      "Speculation regarding a possible move to Man Utd has rumbled on longer than some suspected, but Romano reassured their supporters over the weekend.",
      "“Relax a bit on this one in the sense that, yes, probably there was a feeling two, three weeks ago that this deal could happen in a few days, but it always takes time to prepare a contract, to agree on the salary, to speak with the agent, then to agree with Wolves on the payment terms for the £62.5m release clause,” Romano revealed.",
      "“They need to find an agreement on the payment terms. Man Utd are working on it. Man Utd have very good connection with Cunha, with his agents. It’s a very positive conversation. Ruben Amorim appreciates Cunha, and Cunha knows that very well.",

      "Their floor is high and this was timely evidence; without either of their first-choice centre-halves, the first-choice centre-forward available for only 15 minutes due to injury and none of their best players quite fit enough for the full game, Arsenal gutted up and held out. The obvious summer objective is to raise the ceiling so everyone is at the same level as Jakub Kiwior.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest\nIt always felt as though their run-in could override any inexperience, nerves or fatigue to an extent. Nottingham Forest’s last four Premier League wins have come against the teams in 15th, 16th, 17th and 19th and those points have helped set up a final day shoot-out for possible Champions League qualification.",
      "That is a remarkable achievement for a side which might have been forgiven for another slip at West Ham, so distressing the week must have been with Taiwo Awoniyi’s condition.",
      "But the scene is set for a potential winner-takes-all showdown against Chelsea. Forest, who join the Blues, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City as the only clubs to win 10 or more away games in any of the last five Premier League seasons with supporters in the stands, might genuinely prefer to be on the road. The City Ground, however, will be rocking.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nThere was undoubted frustration at a season which promised so much but had not delivered enough in the way of tangible progress, so joining Bournemouth and likely soon Crystal Palace in setting a new club-record Premier League points tally represents something meaningful for Fulham.",
      "No manager in Premier League history has ever overseen more substitute goals in a single season than Marco Silva (17), who dragged Fulham over the line when introducing Tom Cairney at the break and Harry Wilson four minutes before he taunted Brentford again.",
      "The Portuguese has also gone unbeaten against the five coaches shortlisted for Premier League Manager of the Season, completing the double over three of them. Silva and Fulham are so weird.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nWill literally go an entire Premier League season without winning consecutive games and no-one is bothered.",

      "Newcastle without Alexander Isak\nIt honestly feels like Newcastle might not be as good without their best player, who also happens to be one of the most effective strikers in world football.",
      "In the four Premier League games Isak has missed this season, Newcastle have scored once. That was an Anthony Gordon penalty in a draw.",
      "It does not bode well for a final day the Magpies must already be dreading. Callum Wilson against the single most motivated form of Jordan Pickford there has ever been feels like a mismatch.",
      "",
      "West Ham\nIt seems entirely sub-optimal for a team’s two best players in any game to be among those already announced to be leaving at the end of their contracts in the summer. West Ham can quite easily justify the decisions not to extend the terms of Aaron Cresswell or Vladimir Coufal, but it only really works if more than one of those sticking around start to step up.",
      "Perhaps only Arsenal have a more fundamentally important summer ahead with little room for error, and the Gunners at least have the benefit of cohesion, kinship and a world-class coach entirely suited to the existing squad.",
      "Graham Potter, for all his talents, seems to be increasingly aware of how atrocious a fit he is with these West Ham players.",
      "The change in approach has been too much and the incompatibility for so many is painfully obvious. Jarrod Bowen might be good enough to thrive in any system but without even a semi-competent modern midfield everything is built on quicksand.",
      "Then West Ham’s interminable centre-forward search means that a style predicated on games being decided by the finest margins often backfires. Eight of Potter’s nine losses have been by a single goal and while he is right to point out how “in every game we’ve been competitive”, at some point that becomes an irreversible pattern of failure rather than a tantalising idea of how defeats could suddenly turn into draws or even wins if nothing actually changes.",
      "With the two surviving clubs below them almost certain not to be quite so cataclysmically awful next season, West Ham are the closest to being pulled into a relegation fight. It might take just one more inadequate transfer window, which does not bode well considering those particular failures is how this mess has been so carelessly constructed.",

      "",
      "Sergio Reguilon\nIt felt like a risk to hand Reguilon a first Premier League start for Spurs since April 2022 in the same week he almost injured Brennan Johnson in training despite being on the same team during a drill, but the two Europa League finalists have been fighting for weeks over who can go to the most unnecessary lengths to entirely torch their domestic season more thoroughly in the name of the most ludicrous Champions League backdoor ever conceived, and one of those sides was always going to go too far.",
      "Reguilon actually fared well enough against Aston Villa and considering his predicament has shown an unreasonable level of commitment to a badge which has wanted nothing to do with him for longer than anyone cares to remember. But it is a great bit that someone contracted to Spurs for five years has won more games for Brentford (five), Atletico Madrid (four) and Manchester United (three) than he has Spurs (zero) over the last three of them.",
      "And that isn’t the half of it. Reguilon has played the most Premier League minutes (196) of any player whose side is yet to score a single solitary sodding goal with them on the pitch this season. His celebration for Mathys Tel’s arse-based stoppage-time consolation in a 8-1 defeat to Brighton on the final day will be biblical.",

      "Ipswich\nTwo points from four games against their historically bad relegated brethren really does seem quite foreboding.",

      "And now Spanish newspaper Marca claims that the ‘absence of achievements’ at Al-Nassr since Ronaldo joined ‘has unleashed an earthquake at the club and when that happens in a Saudi entity, changes come throughout the structure and affects the field, bench and the upper echelons.’",

      "2. Arsenal’s CL run. Regardless of your opinions of Arteta, it seems strange to criticise him for getting a team to compete and be utter hard nutters when previously they were castigated for being too soft. You can dislike him and give him credit for being a decent manager too…! Those Declan Rice free kicks against Real will live long in the memory.",
      "3. Mo Salah being utterly brilliant. I remember watching the 3-6 against Spurs at Xmas and saying ‘Salah’s not done a lot here; Spence has dealt with him quite well.’ I still think the second part of the statement could be true, but he ended up with two goals and two assists, so what do I know?",
      "4. Manchester United being a bit pants. As someone born in the eighties and grew up in the nineties, I had to watch quite a few red Premier League lifts. To see them languishing towards the bottom of the league is a bit mad yet they could still put a trophy in the cabinet…it’s a bit bonkers.",
      "5. Bournemouth being boss for a period. Iraola has got that side playing some wonderful football and although they’ve dropped off slightly towards the end, no one expected them to be competing for European spots deep into the season. A big summer ahead could lead to real excitement next year.",
      "6. Nottingham Forest going mental. Although you can hang your hat on Nuno’s formation changes and when he’ll do them, I’m not sure anyone expected them to be this good, nor Chris Wood turn into prime original Ronaldo. I really hope they take one of the remaining European spots this Sunday. Ideally at the expense of….",
      "7. Club 130 charges. Winning nothing. As the yoot say, ‘you love to see it’.",
      "8. PSG looking like an actual team. The speed of the passing and transitions through midfield against the three English sides in the knockout phase was an absolute joy to watch at times.

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 15 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.5\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",
      "",
      "",
      "4) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.2% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, leaving him level with David Raya for the Golden Gloves award.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final.",
      "",
      "6) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "7) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "8) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "9) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",

      "10) Alisson (Liverpool): +1.3\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "12) David Raya (Arsenal): +0.9\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.1\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "14) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.1\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it matters have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",

The one who has lost a hundred times and gets the redemption of one moment when all his efforts are rewarded.",

League so raging against it being diluted further is like adding a gallon of water to a lake and objecting it’ll raise the level.

      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "He was the first man to win Portugal's second tier with a B team, finished sixth with little Chaves and took Vitoria Guimaraes into Europe. Castro then won the title in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk before embarking on a new adventure in South America.",
      "When he left Botafogo in 2023, the Brazilian club were seven points clear at the top of the table and he finished that calendar year as the coach with the most wins in world football over the past 12 months - there were 51 of them, four clear of Pep Guardiola.",
      "All of which is a rather long-winded way of saying that, for all this, Castro knows by now the first question that is coming his way. That is because his most recent appointment was in Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr. So, what exactly is it like coaching Cristiano Ronaldo?",
      "Al Nassr won the Arab Club Champions Cup under Castro, the victory coming after extra-time courtesy of two goals by you know who. In total, Ronaldo scored 55 goals in 55 games under his management. \"We shared some great moments together.\"",
      "Does Castro have any special insight into how it is that Ronaldo continues to pummel goals for club and country even after turning 40? \"What set his apart is what happens before and after training - the so called 'invisible training' that he does,\" he explains.",
      "\"His behavior is all tailored towards sports performance - his diet, his sleep, and his recovery. He is a person deeply concerned with eating well, sleeping well and preparing his body properly. In my opinion, this is clearly where Cristiano's longevity comes from.\"",
      "Did it inspire others? \"Of course,\" he replies. \"Every positive example helps us grow. Our parents, our friends.\" Did he learn from Ronaldo as well? \"Coaches learn from players. Anyone who thinks they know everything becomes stuck. It is a very limiting mindset.\"",
      "Given that Erik ten Hag saw no role for Ronaldo at Manchester United, in part because of the player's inability or unwillingness to press from the front, one wonders what exactly he makes of that decision. \"We look at each player and we adjust things,\" he explains.",
      "\"We adjust according to their identity. That is exactly what I do - with Cristiano and with everyone else. That is my duty as a leader, as a coach. Our job means we have to look at the group of players and get the most out of them as a team. I have no doubt about that.",
      "\"That is why we need to find a system that enhances the players that we have. I cannot stick rigidly to a tactical system and refuse to change. I cannot just go to the end with my idea, no matter what, because that would lead to failure and disaster.\"",
      "It is interesting to hear a coach of such experience talk about the need to adapt his ideas. At the age of 63, Castro is still making those adjustments - because the game demands it. \"Football has evolved and not only the tactical systems,\" he acknowledges.",
      "\"Science has become intertwined with the game. The media are much more active. Player representation has changed. Coaching staffs have increased significantly in number and their areas of expertise. We all have to adapt to match this evolution.",
      "\"The intensity has increased, which has forced us to change our training methodologies and focus more on player recovery. We had to evolve in the tools we use and become much more comprehensive and knowledgeable about everything that surrounds us.",
      "\"A coach must be much more strategic now. In the past, coaches could be known for their tactical system. Today, I have to give my team the versatility to understand multiple systems, to make faster decisions because there is less and less room for hesitation.",
      "\"Today, it is about reading the game, solving situations. We create exercises to address these tactical changes and respond to the tactical shifts during a game, to overcome those challenges posed by the opponent and to put the opposition in difficulty too.\"",
      "In Castro's view, this represents a major change in how coaches need to approach football. \"Training sessions are much richer now. There has been a radical shift in how we look at training and how we prepare players for the various phases of a game.\"",
      "Some developments he is not so fond of. He has spoken of how youngsters are more focused on the individual than the team, but he stops short of suggesting it is a problem. \"It does require constant reminders about what teamwork should be,\" he says.",
      "\"But through good communication, the players always end up understanding and following the team path. We, as coaches, also need to recognise that the individualistic players remain assets. It is the job of the coach to connect them to the team.\"",
      "The appetite remains - Castro describes doing that as \"fantastic\" - and Portuguese coaches are proving better at it than most. There are three of them working in the Premier League at present - Ruben Amorim, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Marco Silva.",
      "\"The Premier League is the biggest showcase in world football. It is the best league in the world and has the best professionals working in it so I have no doubt that if they are there, it is because they are of excellent quality, taking a successful path to get there.",
      "\"I do not really like distinguishing coaches by nationality as quality has no nationality. But I can speak about our coaching school because it has managed to combine scientific knowledge, academic background, and the other experiences of football perfectly.",
      "\"Many of us Portuguese coaches worked in academies, which helped us to understand younger players - development programs, methodologies, and all the factors that shape a player's identity. It is about how we put individual talent into the service of the team.\"",
      "A lesson that Luis Castro learned with Cristiano Ronaldo."

      "Man Utd lost their 18th league game of the season in a 1-0 loss at Chelsea; Roy Keane thinks defeat in the Europa League final would destroy the club's pulling power; Keane: \"I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Man Utd. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club\"",
      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""

      "The pressure was on for Chelsea after Aston Villa beat Tottenham, a result which would have moved them above Enzo Maresca's side had they dropped points but, after a tense wait for the breakthrough, captain Reece James set up Cucurella with a fine turn and cross.",
      "Although Ruben Amorim went with a strong line-up ahead of the Europa League final, if Chelsea had slipped up against this United side, 16th and now winless for a record eight Premier League games, questions would have been asked.",
      "Chelsea will at least be in the top five when they go to Nottingham Forest in their final game of the league season on May 25. Victory at the City Ground would guarantee a return to the Champions League after two years away.",
      "United have now lost 18 games in the league this season and are yet to hit 40 points, usually the target for teams to avoid relegation, with just one game left against Villa. Everything is riding on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham.",

      "There was a party atmosphere after the full-time whistle blew for the final time at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea's owners are just one win away from their first Champions League qualification after more than £1bn spent and three coaches sacked.",
      "Behdad Eghbali, co-founder of Clearlake Capital, and co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley were on the pitch enjoying the moment with players and staff after the win was sealed. How different it might have been if there was another slip.",

      "Tension had built around the stadium - and only grew when Villa's victory over Spurs was confirmed - until the skipper came up with the moment of brilliance required to break the deadlock, having struck a post with an exquisite strike in the first half.",
      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer. The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and can push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "\"I knew I had space and time. I knew I put the ball in a good area, this guy was always arriving.",
      "\"We've been working the whole season, the message has been clear from the start. Executing it has been hard. Today, what we're trying to do pays off.",
      "\"I feel confident, it's the most I've played in a few seasons. I want to help the team and hope we can finish it in the right way.",
      "\"The Champions League is where the club belongs, competing in the best competitions. People like to write us off and call us young ,but it's an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do to get the three points.\""

      "Friday 16 May 2025 18:45, UK",
      "An \"embarrassed\" Ruben Amorim has claimed there is \"something wrong\" with the way his Manchester United side play football ahead of their meeting with Chelsea, live on Friday Night Football.",
      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",
      "\"We need to feel that. We need to get angry with the critics and perform. The worst thing we can do is let it go, that is so hard to understand.\""
