      "Manchester United youngster Dan Gore has returned to Rotherham on loan for the 2025-26 campaign after his spell with the Millers was cut short due to injury last season.",
      "Gore - who is known for having a bust-up with Anthony Martial during training - initially joined Rotherham in January but only played a total of three games in all competitions before suffering a foot fracture in training.",
      "The 20-year-old has long been earmarked as an outstanding youngster that could make his first team breakthrough at Old Trafford, but the midfielder has not yet had his moment and will hope to impress with Rotherham in the upcoming season.",
      "In a statement, United said: \"Dan Gore has completed a second successive loan move to Rotherham United and is set to spend the 2025/26 season with the Millers.",
      "\"In January, he joined Rotherham for the first time and made three appearances as the South Yorkshire side finished 13th in League One. He’ll now hope to build on that in his second spell at the New York Stadium. Good luck, Dan!\"",
      "Gore reportedly had a row in training with Martial back in 2022 after being invited to take part in a session by former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The midfielder was hoping to catch the eye during a training session while the rest of his United team-mates were at the 2022 World Cup but is said to have clattered Martial during a strong challenge.",
      "It's claimed tempers boiled over between the pair, who were pulled apart, with heavy tackles on established first team stars forbidden in training. Martial reportedly apologised to Gore and the dispute was quashed.",
      "Gore will be hoping for better luck at Rotherham after his freak injury, which baffled manager Steve Evans after players were given light training regimes.",
      "Evans said at the time: \"He worked for two days in the team and went home from training on Friday feeling good. I got a call from the medical staff to say that he’d woken up with his foot really sore.",
      "“It’s unbelievable. We didn’t do enough in training for him to have a sore nose let alone a sore foot. Until I hear more from the medical staff as to how it’s happened and why it’s happened then it’s … maybe God will tell me when I go to sleep tonight.\"",
      "“The kid trained really well and didn’t feel a thing. He was going to play a big part for us and then, after he’d gone home, he spoke to the head of medical and said he was feeling his foot.",
      "\"Nobody is more devastated than me. I worked really hard to get him here. He had three clubs above us in League One who wanted but he chose us because of the football I convinced him he would get.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Bryan Mbeumo could be handed his dream shirt number of 19 if he can wrap up a move to Manchester United, with the digits currently available at Old Trafford.",
      "United are still locked in talks with Brentford but negotiations have dragged on for more than a month as the Bees look to get as much as possible for the Cameroon international, who cost them just £5.8million in 2019.",
      "There has been frustration over the low progress of discussions between the two clubs, but now United have submitted a third bid of £70m - hoping it can tempt Brentford into selling their star man.",
      "Mbeumo is keen on completing the move to Old Trafford and should the move come to fruition, it seems there will be an added incentive for the 25-year-old.",
      "He has always played in the No 19 shirt during his footballing career, having used the number for both Brentford and Cameroon on international duty.",
      "And if he joined United, he would be able to snap up that shirt number immediately because it is currently vacant.",
      "The last player who wore number 19 for United was defender Raphael Varane, who left the club last summer, joining Serie A side Como.",
      "It comes after United had two bids rejected for Mbeumo, the last one being worth around £62.5m - the same amount they paid to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "The Bees have been adamant that United should pay them more than they did for Cunha because Mbeumo outscored the Brazilian last season and is also the younger player.",
      "But a deal is now likely to be agreed after United paid Brentford's asking price for the player - who has already thrashed out personal terms.",
      "He has also told Brentford he doesn't want to join any other club despite links to Tottenham, who were interested in the forward after recruiting his former Bees boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Mbeumo netted an impressive 20 goals in the Premier League for Brentford last season and is one of the most sought-after players in the top flight. He has scored a total of 70 goals in 242 appearances for the team since 2019, having started off in the Championship.",

      "Manchester United have tabled a final take-it-or-leave-it offer worth up to £70million for Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo. United had previously failed with two bids for Mbeumo, but are hoping to make it third time lucky with their latest offer of £65m plus £5m in performance-related add-ons.",
      "Brentford have yet to respond to United's latest offer, but with the London club holding out for £70m for their star forward, a deal is now likely to be agreed.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, has already agreed personal terms with United, and has informed Brentford and other clubs that he doesn't want to move anywhere else, having rejected approaches from both Newcastle and Tottenham - now under ex-Bees head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wanted his summer signings on board before he and his squad fly to the US next week for their pre-season tour, with Matheus Cunha the only new arrival.",
      "But United's protracted pursuit of Mbeumo is set to end successfully with their latest and final offer, which is likely to see the 25-year-old finally join the Red Devils. United had an initial proposal of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rejected, while a follow-up offer of £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses was also rejected.",
      "Brentford have stood firm on their demands, wanting more than the £62.5m United paid Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha. The Bees have been steadfast in their belief that Mbeumo, having scored more than the Brazilian last term, and being younger, should cost more than United's new No.10, who was purchased via a release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "United are confident their latest offer will be accepted and bring to an end the long-running saga of Mbeumo's future.",
      "If Brentford do accept United's latest bid, it remains to be seen if they are willing to let their two star forwards leave this summer, with Newcasle having targeted Yoane Wissa. Newcastle switched their attention to Wissa after cooling their interest in Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, who prefers a move to Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "Against that backdrop, Newcastle are now exploring a move for £30million-rated Wissa, who scored 19 Premier League goals last season.",
      "Nottingham Forest failed recently with a bid for Wissa and it remains to be seen if Newcastle can persuade Brentford to part company with him, particularly if Mbeumo is sold to United.",

      "There are now just 29 days until the start of the Premier League season and squads are far from complete, with several massive transfers still in the pipeline.",
      "With the Club World Cup concluded, the focus is now on pre-season, with teams jetting around the world to build up their fitness. But for supporters, there is still the question of who will be playing for their side in the 2025/26 season.",
      "We have seen a few sagas develop over the past few months – we’re looking at you Viktor Gyokeres – while other stories have emerged more recently. Clubs have until September 1 to complete deals, but managers desperately want them done before the season starts, so the race against the clock is on.",
      "The Swedish striker is closing in on a move to the Premier League – finally.",
      "Gyokeres has been desperate to leave Sporting Lisbon and move to a bigger league to test himself this summer. At the age of 27, he wants to make the jump, just two years after leaving Coventry City for Portugal. \"What I managed to do at Sporting, I am convinced I can achieve anywhere,” he has said. “You haven't seen the best Gyokeres yet.\"",
      "Arsenal turned their full attention away from Benjamin Sesko to Gyokeres and sporting director Andrea Berta has gone through somewhat fractious negotiations with the Portuguese club.",
      "But now, after strike threats and presidential fury, a deal has been agreed between the two clubs, personal terms with the player are sorted, and it’s a matter of time before his £63.6million deal is all ticked through and he becomes an Arsenal player.",
      "A story that exploded and then seemingly faded in equally quick time.",
      "Like Arsenal before them, Liverpool declared their interest in signing Newcastle’s goal machine. They approached the Magpies over the subject on Tuesday, floating the idea of a blockbuster £120m transfer.",
      "Having already spent around £170m this summer to sign Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and co, there was understandable shock among rival fans: How would Liverpool afford such expenditure in the age of profit and sustainability rules?",
      "The Reds believed a deal would be viable, with the sale of Darwin Nunez offsetting the cost, but the bigger stumbling block proved to be Newcastle’s stance: Isak is not for sale. And that has led them to the next player on our list.",
      "Newcastle and Liverpool are joined together in their transfer business this summer. Eddie Howe’s side bid £70m for Ekitike earlier this week, only to see the offer rejected – and now Liverpool are not just chasing the Frankfurt striker, but are fast closing in.",
      "Liverpool have come to this conclusion after determining that Newcastle won’t budge over Isak. The fact that their alternative also happens to have been a top target for the Magpies is a coincidence, which makes the whole situation more intriguing.",
      "Liverpool want to sell Nunez, who has not lived up to his billing. The Uruguayan had been set to join Napoli, having agreed to the move, but things ground to a halt over the transfer fee, with Liverpool holding out for £70m, while the Serie A champions would only pay £50m.",
      "That could still change, but with Napoli signing Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese, that avenue may be closed. Instead, it could be Saudi Arabia for Nunez, with sides pushing for his services. It's been claimed that new Al-Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi has identified the former Benfica star as a target if they fail to sign Victor Osimhen.",
      "Rashford isn’t wanted by Manchester United and has been placed in the bomb squad by Ruben Amorim while he tries to find a new club. The problem is that Rashford only has eyes for one club : Barcelona.",
      "He has rejected approaches from Saudi Arabia, despite their lucrative nature, and is waiting for Barca. There are many hurdles though: Rashford is paid £325,000 per week at United and is under contract until June 2028. He is willing to lower his wages, but United want a sale and Barca want a loan deal, due to their financial situation.",
      "It looks like this one could rumble on for some time, with a compromise needing to be reached.",
      "Garnacho is in the same boat as Rashford, training separately from their United team-mates while they await a transfer elsewhere. He attracted interest from Napoli, but is understood to prefer a move to a Premier League rival.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea and Tottenham have been monitoring his situation, but United’s £70m valuation is an obvious barrier to a deal, while his attitude towards the end of last season may have put off some suitors. The 21-year-old is under contract until June 2028 with United, but doesn’t appear to have any future under Ruben Amorim. United have so far failed to shift any of their unwanted players – a group which includes Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia – and will get increasingly desperate as September 1 approaches.",
      "One of the reasons they want Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and co gone is so there is space in the squad, and further funds, to sign Mbeumo. Brentford are standing firm over their valuation for the Cameroon international, who banged in 20 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "United had an initial proposal of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rejected, while a follow-up offer of £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses was also rejected. Mbeumo wants to move to Old Trafford and there is a sense that the deal will happen because Brentford are loathed to keep players who don’t want to be there.",
      "But they are also more than happy to drag their feet and get the very best deal possible. Brentford's director of football Phil Giles is the man who has been holding up the process - now we'll learn if United's final take-it-or-leave-it third offer is enough.",
      "Guehi is no stranger to a transfer saga, having been the subject of interest from Newcastle last summer. That ended when Crystal Palace rejected a £70m bid for the England centre-back, but the rumours are back this summer.",
      "Liverpool want a centre-back after letting Jarell Quansah leave for Bayer Leverkusen and amid rumours of Ibrahima Konate leaving for Real Madrid. Guehi has entered the final year of his contract with Palace and reports suggest that he is willing to wait it out. Palace now value Guehi at £40m and the ball is in Liverpool’s court.",
      "Things have become ugly here. Tottenham bid £60m for the playmaker, only for Nottingham Forest to react by considering legal action over what they believe may be an illegal approach.",
      "The £60m bid triggered Gibbs-White’s release clause and Spurs tried to line up a medical for the England star. Tottenham are understood to still be confident they will get their man, having opted for Gibbs-White over Palace star Eberechi Eze.",
      "Forest are perturbed that Spurs knew the exact details of their star player’s release clause and could complain to the Premier League, potentially holding up his exit.",
      "This one has come out of the left field. The idea that Chelsea might sell Jackson is not surprising, given they have signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this summer, but the potential destination is intriguing.",
      "Chelsea are said to value Jackson at £100m after hearing of interest from AC Milan – and now United are sniffing around. United could sell Rasmus Hojlund back to Serie A and are not convinced by Joshua Zirkzee, meaning they could move for another striker to complement Matheus Cunha and, hopefully, Mbeumo.",

The report also states that Brentford do not want to lose both Wissa and Mbeumo in the same window. As a result, United could miss out on Mbeumo altogether if Newcastle are able to sign Wissa.",

      "The Professional Footballers' Association has been branded a “disgrace” for its perceived failure to adequately tackle the dementia crisis among ex-players. Former players are three-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than the general population, as a result of heading the ball over a sustained period during their careers.",
      "The PFA and the Premier League launched the Football Brain Health Fund (FBHF), with £1million initially made available to ex-players and their families who have been impacted by dementia. But former Manchester United defender David May said that figure is nowhere near enough to cover the costs for the families of those ex-players who are suffering from dementia.",
      "May also claimed PFA chief Maheta Molango - the highest paid union boss in the country on £650,000-a-year - has failed to give sufficient answers as to where the money has been spent.",
      "“I've written to him four times now, asking where the funds go,” said May. “They have a fund of £1m for dementia and I've asked the question on four occasions.",
      "“The last time I asked the question his answer was, 'why don't you come in and have a chat?'. I don't want to have a chat, I want to know where the money's gone.",
      "“But they're constantly letting people down. They're a disgrace. My former boss at Blackburn, Tony Parkes, is now in a home. He doesn't have a clue what's going on and he's going to pass away in there.",
      "“I'm not saying if you put him in an environment with better facilities, he's going to get better. But if he was in a facility with other ex-players, maybe he would have a better quality of life, with familiar faces around him.",
      "“But the PFA just keeps knocking us back, but that makes us even more determined to believe that our day will come. The PFA needs to address it properly and think, 'we need to do something for these ex-players'.",
      "“Families are asked 'do the players have assets they can sell?' or 'can they remortgage?' and 'can they sell their house?' - they shouldn't have to.",
      "“The game is awash with money. Half a billion pounds in agents' fees went out of the game last year. It shouldn't have to fall on the Government to pay for the welfare for footballers, when there's that much money in the game. It's disgusting.”",
      "May is part of the Football Families for Justice (FFJ) group, aimed at improving the lives of former players suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, which has been backed by Sir David Beckham.",
      "England World Cup winners Sir Bobby and Jack Charlton died after suffering from dementia, as did fellow 1966 heroes Martin Peters, Ray Wilson and Nobby Stiles. More recently, former United defender Gordon McQueen passed away from dementia, while ex Bradford and Hull striker Dean Windass, 55, has been diagnosed with the degenerative condition.",
      "The PFA said they have made offers to meet with May to discuss his views and their work on the issue, with that door still open to him. The union also said £1m was an initial figure to launch the FBHF, but the total amount of funding committed on an ongoing basis and allocated to families has exceeded £3m."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim's hard line stance with his petulant stars has been backed to lead the club back to the glory days of the past.",
      "Amorim has banned five United players – Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia – from returning to the club for pre-season training.",
      "All five want to leave and Amorim does not want their negative influence around the squad, so has told them to stay away until United's squad have left for their pre-season tour of the US.",
      "Amorim's ruthless approach has been backed by former United defender David May, who said he is right to get rid of players who put their own egos ahead of the interests of the team.",
      "“I think this manager is perfect for the club,” said May, who won the Treble with United in 1999. “I like what he does, how he speaks and I think the club is in really good hands with him.",
      "“It's just the players and the mentality of some of them, who simply have to leave. You need players who will run through brick walls and who won't question, but will just get on with it.",
      "“You can question certain things, but go and see the manager if you've not played, have it out in his office. Don't do it in the press or on social media. You see some of the stuff that's out there and it's so disrespectful, what some of the players are doing.",
      "“You look at some of the players and their body language, and I think I'd much rather have 10 average players who will work their socks off than these prima-donnas who don't care.",
      "“It's only when you leave the club, as a player, that you think 'wow, that is such a special place'. To be part of it, to have 70,000 people behind you, week-in, week-out, is the best feeling ever.",
      "“These players have to realise that. I spoke to Ruben and he said 'the club is amazing, it's so special, but I feel I'm betraying the fans because I'm not getting the results'.",
      "“I told him every fan I know absolutely loves what he's doing and he said 'nothing will change until the mentality changes' and he's spot-on.”",
      "United ended last season in 15th place, their lowest finish of the Premier League era, while defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final means no European football for only the second time in 35 years.",
      "But May, who is climbing Snowdon next month to raise funds for the Manchester United Foundation, reckons the absence of European football could work in the team's favour. “Sometimes you have to hit rock-bottom – and I think we are at rock-bottom,” said May.",
      "“But I think it's a blessing in disguise. You just have to concentrate on the league every week and not worry about Europe. Ruben can focus on starting the season well. We've got a great opening game, at home to Arsenal, and it's important we get off on the right foot.",
      "“This pre-season is all about getting the right players in and certain players out. Matheus Cunha, there's something about him, he's a bit like Eric Cantona. He has that nastiness about him. United need that and I'm sure the fans will absolutely adore him. The fact Bryan Mbeumo said he wants to come here – how good is that to hear? He's not coming for the money.",
      "“I don't see any reason why we can't be pushing for the top four next season. There are no distractions with Europe, it's just a case of focusing on every league game. You can't have any excuses and you can't feel tired, because you're not playing every three or four days like last season.”",
      "David May is climbing Snowdon on August 2 to raise money for the Manchester United Foundation. Fans can sign up to join him here www.mufoundation.org/snowdon",

      "Wiles is currently working at Old Trafford and is leading the U14s, but is set to cross the divide and go and work at Kirby with the Reds' older age group. It would bring to an end the 40-year-old's relatively brief stint in Manchester, having only joined them in September 2024.",
      "Liverpool have been on the lookout for a new coach of their youth grade side since Marc Bridge-Wilkinson called time on his decade with the club. They reluctantly accepted his request to leave and he will go and work as an assistant at Huddersfield Town.",
      "Wiles though is highly rated and the Athletic reports his move is as good as sealed. He previously served as the caretaker boss of Salford City, where Gary Neville is a co-owner.",
      "His expected departure from Old Trafford is blow and continues the worrying trend of academy coaches who have chosen to leave for improved positions elsewhere, despite proving to be hugely competent in their roles with the Manchester side.",
      "Justin Cochrane, Paul McShane, Tom Huddlestone, Neil Ryan, and Neil Gittins have all left United in recent years. Neil Wood is also in that category having previously left the youth set-up in Manchester to go and be the boss at Salford.",
      "Wiles’ first coaching role came in Blackpool’s academy in June 2013, before he decided to put his focus back on his playing career, which later ended in 2018. Once he retired he became an U18s coach for League One club Fleetwood Town and was their interim manager in 2021 after they sacked Joey Barton.",
      "He left Fleetwood to begin work with Salford in 2022, where he was a first-team coach, which ultimately led to him being hired by United’s academy in September last year. Wiles is expected to work with Anthony Ryan when he joins Liverpool, who will step up from the U15s to become assistant head coach for the U18s.",
      "Ryan is currently working as Liverpool U18s’ interim boss after Bridge-Wilkinson left. The club's youth side has been effective in recent years with first Jurgen Klopp, and now Arne Slot, often giving the club's teenage talent a chance to impress."

      "Manchester United are once more closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo - despite Brentford's appointment of Keith Andrews throwing a spanner in the works.",
      "The Red Devils have seen several bids for the Cameroon forward rejected, the last being £60million, with the Bees sticking robustly to their valuation of wanting MORE than what United paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha. On Thursday afternoon, United made their third - and what they say is final - take-it-or-leave-it offer for Mbeumo, worth £65m with £5m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has already agreed personal terms with United, having made clear it's the only place he wants to go. Ex-Brentford boss Thomas Frank was keen on a reunion at Tottenham, was told it wouldn't be happening, and the north Londoners have gone in a different direction.",
      "Andrews replaced Frank at the Gtech Community Stadium and it's understood that his arrival as the new head coach had further complicated matters with the Irishman wanting to keep his top players.",
      "Director of Football Phil Giles had also insisted Mbeumo - who scored 20 times last term and has emerged as the club's prime attacking weapon, stepping up impressively after the departure of Ivan Toney - wouldn't go anywhere until the Bees' valuation was met.",
      "United had wanted to get Mbeumo through the door for the start of their pre-season having originally started negotiations in early June for the 25-year-old. He could yet join them on their tour of the United States.",
      "Giles has maintained that the club will not do business unless it makes sense for them and wasn't closing the door to the possibility of Mbeumo staying in west London for the foreseeable future - leaving it up to United to do what was required to get a deal over the line.",
      "He said: “We’ve made our point clear. If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.”",
      "Mbeumo himself stands to massively increase his pay packet if he does secure a move to Manchester, which could still be on the cards. The Bees have targeted Ipswich's Omari Hutchinson as his replacement - with Mbeumo' increasingly likely to be heading to Old Trafford once more."

The ex-Manchester United star made more than 30 appearances for Everton last term, proving that he can still play regularly in the Premier League, but was let go by the Toffees and is on the lookout for a new club.",
      "A romantic option emerging could see him head back to Vicarage Road with the Hornets, who are looking to land promotion from the Championship this season. Young is yet to drop out of the top flight since helping Watford win promotion back in 2006.",
      "TalkSport reports that the club have no concerns over his age or fitness, but will leave the final decision to new boss Paulo Pezzolano as he plots his recruitment. Young previously made 100 appearances for Watford, scoring 22 times before leaving midway through their relegation year in 2007.",
      "The veteran has now plans to call it a day and recently said: “It's been one of those things where I've played so much this season. I feel so fit. I've not felt as fit as I have done for years. I just want to continue playing, however that may look, however that may seem, I'm not ready to retire.",

      "After leaving Watford, Young's career continued to go from strength to strength. Whilst he was at Villa, he continued to impress and played in a side that threatened to crack the top four. He spent more than four years at Villa Park before catching the attention of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "United signed Young for £17million in 2011 and he was an instant hit, winning his one and only title in his second season with the club. He would later enjoy a renaissance at a converted wing-back and that saw him continue playing for England, where he won 39 caps.",
      "He would leave Manchester in 2019 to join Inter Milan, where he spent two years before returning to England to have a second spell with Villa. Everton were the next club on his CV and Watford could now look to utilise that experience to aid their ambitions this term."

      "The Coronation Street actress, 41, was married to personal trainer Adam Crofts but just four months on from their split, she has been linked to a design guru who has worked for footballer Paul Pogba. Adam Fadle, 38, refurbished the sports star's luxury home in Cheshire shortly after he signed for his team, and his home appears as part of a portfolio on the Panoramic Properties website.",
      "A description on the website reads: \"Panoramic Properties Limited was founded in 2010 by Adam Fadlé and has grown over the years into an award-winning interior design studio.",
      "\"Originally graduating with a degree in architecture, Adam specialised in the luxury interior design sector, where his passion and creative flair came into its own.",
      "“Continuing to build on the company's success over the years and push the boundaries in design, Panoramic Properties is now proudly recognised internationally as one of the leading design studios in the industry.",
      "\"High end interior design has always been at the heart of Panoramic Properties. Our team of talented designers work with both end clients and developers to produce world class homes.\"",
      "According to insiders, Tina, who was married to the original Adam for six years and has a son with him, had simply fallen \"out of love\" with her husband and \"fallen in love\" with another man of the same name.",
      "Speaking to the Sun, they added: \"Tina looked totally mad for Adam and they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.\"",
      "Friends also claimed Tina had \"grew apart\" from her ex, Adam, who she had met in 2011. “Tina and Adam are on good terms, they’re still close and are committed to being a family, even if they’re not together,\" a source claimed.",
      "Tina was cast as Sarah Platt on Coronation Street in 1999, and saw the character through numerous storylines including her infamous teenage pregnancy and her mother Gail Platt's marriage to serial killer Richard Hillman.",
      "She quit the serial in 2007 and had small stints in Waterloo Road and Call the Midwife but ultimately returned to her signature role in 2015, and has remained on-screen ever since.",
      "During her first stint, Tina struck up a relationship with co-star Ryan Thomas, who played her character's then-boyfriend Jason Grimshaw, and they went on to have daughter Scarlett, 16, together.",
      "But they called it quits in 2009 after six years together, and Ryan went on to have Roman, five, and three-year-old Lilah with TOWIE's Lucy Mecklenburgh, to whom he is engaged.",
      "However, Tina and Ryan were far from co-parenting blissfully by 2022, when the actress reportedly smashed Ryan's Range Rover wing mirror with a baseball bat after the pair became embroiled in a furious row.",
      "The alleged incident occurred in March 2022 when Tina stepped out of a friend's party to confront Ryan as he arrived on the scene. It's alleged that subsequently, his Range Rover was targeted with a baseball bat, leading to scratched paintwork and a \"smashed off\" wing mirror."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo Jr has brutally put down Lamine Yamal by saying the Barcelona sensation still has a long way to go before reaching his dad’s level. Ronaldo Sr, currently playing for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, is widely considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time.",
      "The 40-year-old’s incredible career has seen him shatter countless records while playing for the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. He is currently closing in on becoming the first footballer ever to reach 1000 officially registered professional goals.",
      "Yamal, meanwhile, is arguably the best and most exciting talent in the world right now, having lit up European football over the past few seasons with Barcelona and Spain.",
      "The winger, who celebrated his 18th birthday in controversial fashion last week, is among the favourites to win his first Ballon d’Or this year – which Ronaldo has won five times.",
      "Given Yamal’s recent heroics in La Liga, the Champions League and 2024 European Championships, it is understandable that many younger fans consider him a better player than the veteran Ronaldo, who is now considered past his peak.",
      "That view was clear to see in a recent Twitch stream with American creator 2xRaKai, who was travelling in a car with 15-year-old Ronaldo Jr. During the stream, the teenager was asked to name his favourite footballer of all time, to which he instantly replied: “My dad.”",
      "The streamer then took a swipe at Ronaldo Jr by stating Yamal was better than his dad. The Portuguese legend’s son agreed based on their current ability but made it clear that Yamal is still a long way off matching Ronaldo’s stellar career.",
      "He replied: \"Right now? Yes, but Lamine hasn’t won anything yet. He’s very good, but he still hasn’t won anything.\"",
      "Despite Ronaldo Jr's claims, Yamal enjoyed a highly successful 2024/25 season, winning a domestic treble of La Liga, the Spanish Super Cup and Copa del Rey. He also won Euro 2024 with Spain last summer.",
      "He scored 18 goals and assisted a further 25 in 55 appearances in all competitions last season, while Ronaldo had scored only five goals in 19 Sporting CP appearances at the same age.",
      "But while he has no shortage of talent, he would have to continue his current trajectory over the next decade and beyond to match Ronaldo’s legacy and long list of accolades, which include five Champions League trophies and being the all-time leading goal-scorer in international football.",
      "Ronaldo also came out on top when he met Yamal in the 2025 Nations League final clash between Spain and Portugal last month, scoring in a 2-2 draw which Portugal won on penalties.",
      "Yamal is much closer in age to Ronaldo Jr than the footballing legend himself and there is a chance that the two teenagers could share the field in the future.",
      "Ronaldo Jr is an aspiring professional footballer in his own right, currently playing in Al-Nassr’s youth academy. He previously trained with Juventus, Manchester United and Real Madrid during his father’s time with each club.",
      "The youngster was born in the United States and was also able to represent Spain but decided to play for Portugal at youth level, following in his dad’s footsteps. He made his debut for Portugal’s Under-15s against Japan in May and scored his first two goals against Croatia just days later.",

      "The Argentina international, who was available for sale in January, was told to find a new club by the Portuguese head coach after Garnacho was publically critical of the decision to not select him to start in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. As a result, Garnacho has not been part of United's pre-season plans.",
      "Instead the winger — along with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho — has been told he can report to Carrington for training from 5pm, after the first team have completed their training. Thus far, United have not been able to facilitate a transfer for any of the players they want to sell.",
      "Villa have registered their interest in Garnacho, according to the Mail. Chelsea and Tottenham are also said to be monitoring the 21-year-old's situation, who prefers to remain in the Premier League.",
      "United previously valued Garnacho at £70m but that figure may prove difficult to earn given the public fallout of the winger's situation at United. But any fee will provide pure profit for the club in terms of profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Garnacho pictured himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt last month. The young star sparked some controversy when he wore a Rashford top, prompting the ire of some supporters.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa Park, but ultimately did not see the option to make the move permanent activated. The United academy product scored four goals and added six assists in 17 appearances in the Midlands.",
      "Unai Emery's side had a £40m agreement in place with United to seal Rashford's transfer but it ultimately did not come to fruition. The forward instead wants a move that could offer Champions League football, with Barcelona said to be his dream destination.",
      "The Catalan side are said to be more interested in signing Rashford on loan. The England international's contract until 2028, that sees him earn £315,000-per-week could prove problematic to an exit.",
      "Speaking ahead of his loan, Rashford admitted he was keen to find a new club. \"For me, personally, I think I’m ready for a new challenge and the next steps,\" he said.",
      "\"When I leave it’s going to be “no hard feelings”. You’re not going to have any negative comments from me about Manchester United. That’s me as a person.",
      "\"If I know that a situation is already bad I’m not going to make it worse. I’ve seen how other players have left in the past and I don’t want to be that person. When I leave I’ll make a statement and it will be from me.\""

      "United completed the £62.5m signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves as their first deal of the summer transfer window and Mbeumo would further strengthen Ruben Amorim's attacking options.",

      "Manchester United are confident of wrapping up the signing of attacker Bryan Mbeumo after submitting a third bid for the Brentford star.",
      "United have submitted a third bid for the Cameroonian international, understood to be worth up to £70million. They have offered £65m up front and an additional £5m in add-ons.",
      "United have been locked in talks with Brentford for just over six weeks, meaning they will now be hoping it will be third time lucky in their quest to lure him to Old Trafford. Mbeumo made it crystal clear several weeks ago that he wants to move to M16.",
      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals last season, Mbeumo would be a second statement signing of the summer for United. They have already splashed out £62.5m on bringing Matheus Cunha, who scored 17 goals last term, to the club from Wolves.",
      "Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in head coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and there is a strong chance Mbeumo could be installed as the right-sided playmaker. His versatility, though, means he could be deployed elsewhere.",
      "Primarily a winger throughout his time at Brentford, Mbeumo is renowned for cutting in from the right and making full use of his trustworthy left foot. It means he could be an option as either the right-sided No.10 or right wing-back for Amorim.",
      "Amad, who regularly blossomed for United last term, is also equally capable as a right-sided No.10 or right wing-back. With that said, the worst that can happen is that Amad and Mbeumo create healthy competition for each other and a selection dilemma for Amorim.",
      "With Cunha a guaranteed starter and Mbeumo expected to be given the same treatment if he finalises a switch to M16 without any further setbacks, Amorim's first-choice starting XI for the 2025/26 will be closer towards completion.",
      "As things currently stand, United are still in the market for a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper, meaning they will soon have to flex their muscles in the seller's market to fund those prospective additions.",
      "Despite currently being unavailable because of a hamstring injury, Andre Onana is expected to remain United's first-choice goalkeeper this season. United want to recruit a shot-stopper who can compete with and push the Cameroonian, but Onana is under the impression he will remain Amorim's No.1.",
      "United are well-stocked at centre-back and pre-season performances could dictate who starts the season opener against Arsenal in a month's time. Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are the future of United's backline and will believe they are worthy of becoming staples in the wide centre-back roles, while Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire will be fighting to start in the middle.",
      "On the presumption Mbeumo is deployed in attack, Amad is the logical pick at right wing-back after regularly catching the eye on the right flank last season. Meanwhile, Patrick Dorgu is a shoo-in on the opposite flank and will be keen to improve after arriving from Lecce earlier this year.",
      "Following Cunha's arrival, Bruno Fernandes is expected to complete a permanent switch to midfield and occupy one of the two No.8 spots. He regularly operated from the engine room in the second half of last term and rarely looked out of place.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer and Casemiro are all currently jockeying to join Fernandes in midfield, but the club remains keen on signing a new midfielder. Who that could be is currently impossible to predict.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha will build two thirds of Amorim's attack, occupying the two No.10 spots. The United chief struggled in his search for consistency in those two roles last season, meaning it is highly likely those positions could be occupied by new faces.",
      "United's need for an out-and-out centre-forward has been well-documented throughout the summer, and they attempted to solve that particular mission quickly by swooping for Liam Delap last month. However, Chelsea pipped them to his signature.",
      "The Reds have since been heavily linked with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen but are increasingly likely to miss out on both of them. Fortunately, the prospect of adding Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha should ease the attacking burden on whoever leads United's attack come the start of the season.",
      "United's dream XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, new midfielder, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; new striker.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Victor Osimhen still faces an uncertain future at Napoli. The 26-year-old striker was heavily linked with a move to the Premier League last summer, but a deal collapsed, so he joined Galatasaray on loan instead.",
      "Osimhen, who has recently entered the final year of his contract in Naples, featured 30 times in the Süper Lig this season, scoring 26 goals and providing five assists. Playing a key role in Okan Buruk's squad, the Nigeria international fired the club to a third successive title.",
      "He also helped Galatasaray clinch the domestic double, netting a brace against Trabzonspor in the Turkish Cup final. Osimhen was once mooted as a potential target for Manchester United, but now he looks set to stay in Istanbul.",
      "According Sacha Tavolieri, Galatasaray have reached an agreement with Napoli to sign Osimhen. The report claims that the Turkish giants have 'never been so close' to securing the Nigerian's signature, with a €75m (£65m) payment plan in place.",
      "Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano has reported that negotiations are still ongoing between the two clubs. It's said that Napoli have recently sent a counter-proposal to Galatasaray, who are ready to make a decision on the 'new conditions'.",
      "According to German outlet Bild, Newcastle have shortlisted Osimhen and Darwin Nunez as potential targets after dropping out of the race to sign Hugo Ekitike. The report claims that the Eintracht Frankfurt striker has decided that he wants to join Liverpool, who have signalled that they're willing to pay his €100m (£85m) price tag.",
      "It's said that the Premier League champions have already agreed personal terms with Ekitike, who wasn't convinced by a move to St. James' Park. Bild reckons that the Magpies have bid €80m (£69m) for the 23-year-old striker, but the offer was rejected.",

      "It's said that United were 'reluctant' to pay the €75m (£65m) release clause in his contract, so they 'studied' how to finance a bid. La Gazzetta dello Sport added that Osimhen rejected an offer from Al-Hilal at the time.",
      "Towards the end of May, the Galatasaray boss provided an update on Osimhen's future. In an interview with 'I Just Spoke', as quoted by Turkish outlet NTV Sport, Buruk shut down rumours linking the striker with a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"Osimhen will look at the conditions,\" he said. \"He's very happy here at Galatasaray. He's living the best days of his life. The player will decide about his future, as he's made an incredible contribution here. We need to respect him, but we are hopeful that he will stay with us.\"",
      "Buruk added: \"He's a professional player. There are talks about it, but Osimhen will make the choice. He will look at the conditions. The part about Osimhen agreeing with the [Saudi] Arabian side is not true.\""

      "Reflecting on the news, a delighted Gore shared images of his unveiling at Rotherham on Instagram with the caption: \"Buzzin' to be back here on a season-long loan! Rotherham United, can't wait to get started.\"",
      "Among those to send his best wishes to Gore in the comments was Mainoo who made 32 appearances alongside the midfielder for the U18s and U21s before progressing to the first team. \"Let's go,\" the midfielder simply wrote as he sent his support to Gore.",
      "For Mainoo, this could be merely the first of several exits from United that are on the horizon. Notably, his good friend and former academy teammate Alejandro Garnacho has requested to leave the club this summer.",
      "Garnacho and Ruben Amorim's relationship broke down significantly following the Europa League final, when he was highly critical of United's season and the decision to not start him against Tottenham in Bilbao. After this incident, Amorim informed the player that he could seek a move to another club which the winger agreed with.",
      "As for Mainoo, he has yet to find a settled place in this United team to date under Amorim. The Reds are hopeful of completing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo this summer, which could cast further doubt on to his role in the team."

A third bid of £65m plus £5m in add-ons has been submitted with United confident this will be the means of finding a breakthrough in negotiations that have taken place for longer than a month.",
      "In a dream scenario, the 25-year-old is recruited with plenty of time to spare before the season begins.",
      "Mbeumo would further bolster an attack already welcoming Matheus Cunha over the break. United struck a fairly simple deal with Wolves, paying the Brazilian's £62.5m release clause to make him their first signing.",
      "Their roles in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system would be to support the central striker in whatever capacity they can manage. That task is set to be difficult, with the manager's preferred striker undetermined at this stage.",
      "Sporting director Jason Wilcox did not have to look hard to find Liam Delap and his £30m release clause from relegated Ipswich Town, though the former Manchester City youth star chose to sign for Chelsea instead. This created a significant stumbling block as the striker market has been crazy this summer - the rest seem to be tipped to move for at least double the price.",
      "Hottest links came to Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting CP, Amorim's former student. The Sweden international appears destined for Arsenal though, so he may make his Premier League debut at Old Trafford yet, only for the wrong team.",
      "Then there is Hugo Ekitike, another name on the register, who has reportedly agreed personal terms to join Liverpool, who have scuppered Newcastle United's latest attempt to land the 23-year-old.",

With it reported that the Argentine winger prefers to stay in the Premier League, where Aston Villa are said to be lurking, there is potential for some sort of deal involving a player swap, at least in part.",

A win-win scenario for all on the surface of it as Villa are alleviated of one of their highest earners whilst his proven Premier League experience directly improves Amorim's dream XI for Arsenal entirely.",

      "Aston Villa have reportedly become the latest club to express interest in United's Garnacho. The Reds previously valued Garnacho at £70million, but that figure may be hard to achieve given the public fallout over the winger's situation at United. However, any fee will provide pure profit for the club in terms of profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Such a fee is steep for a player who is yet to reach his potential. His record of 11 goals across all competitions last season hardly justifies a £70m price tag.",
      "But a solution involving a swap deal with United-linked Ollie Watkins may benefit both parties. The Reds are in desperate need of a striker and Watkins' Premier League experience, a major factor for Ineos, makes him ideal.",
      "Many United fans will scoff at the idea of signing Watkins, especially with Arsenal looking to sign Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool potentially signing Hugo Ekitike.",
      "However, the Reds have no European football and are set for another transition season. He may not take United to their ultimate aim of a league title or Champions League win, but he's the perfect stepping stone for where they currently are.",

      "In truth, the relationship between Garnacho and United has strained considerably since Ruben Amorim arrived in the north west. It began all the way back in December 2024 when the Argentine was dropped for the Manchester derby alongside Marcus Rashford.",
      "While Rashford's relationship with the new manager spiralled downwards from there, Garnacho managed to steady the ship but this would prove to be the beginning of the end. Strike two came against Ipswich Town when the winger chose to go straight back to the dressing room after being substituted instead of watching the rest of the match from the bench.",
      "On this occasion, Garnacho was disciplined lightly with a food bill for the United squad deemed an appropriate punishment. However, he was as good as out following his antics on the week of the Europa League final.",
      "Presumably, after learning he would not be starting in Bilbao, the forward published an image of himself celebrating against Manchester City in the last final he started. However, when he criticised Amorim indirectly after being given roughly 20 minutes of game time against Tottenham Hotspur, the writing was on the wall.",
      "Amorim informed him shortly afterwards that he was free to find a new club and Garnacho's agreement has set the prophecy in motion. It is a particularly sad state of affairs for United fans who let the Argentine inherit his idol - Cristiano Ronaldo's - chant once the Portuguese legend left United.",
      "While he would have perhaps preferred the No.7 shirt which was given to Mason Mount instead, there is clearly a part of Garnacho that wishes to replicate the career of his idol. And, who can blame him?",
      "Ronaldo was a trophy-winning machine and was highly successful for United. Even after his exit in 2022 which was thoroughly unprofessional and worse than anything Garnacho has done, the 40-year-old has repaired his relationship with the fanbase and he remains an icon on the Stretford End.",
      "Garnacho will not receive that same luxury. For starters, it is obvious that the 21-year-old has not managed to accomplish as near as much as Ronaldo and his insistence on remaining in the Premier League only harms his case.",
      "When Ronaldo left for Real Madrid it was seen as a mark of respect that he did not play for another Premier League club. If Garnacho gets his way, he will be receiving a frosty reception at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "There is a lot of goodwill towards Amorim among the Reds' fans. Matchgoers respect what he is trying to do and the honesty in which he responds to critics and addresses the media.",
      "That is not to say that Erik ten Hag was not well liked during the Ronaldo saga but there was a sense that the player had clearly done more for the player than the manager. Even having won silverware, Garnacho cannot share that sentiment.",
      "In footballing terms, there is more than likely a better fit for Garnacho in the Premier League than Amorim's anti-winger system and the Argentine may not care about the legacy he has with the United fanbase. But the reality of the situation is clear and he has a long way to go in three years if he is to replicate where his idol was at when he left Old Trafford."

      "For the majority of the summer, this move has dominated the headlines and threatened to fizzle out with plenty of time lost and nothing to show for it. However, MEN Sport understands this afternoon that a third bid has been submitted to Brentford and there is a confidence in the Reds' camp that this will be accepted.",
      "If it is, that will be marked as a standout piece of business for United as they look to complete their strengthening of the attacking midfield position. For Mbeumo, this news will be music to his ears as there have been numerous reports that he is growing frustrated by the process dragging on.",
      "United will hope that if/when the bid is accepted, the next stages of the process will be mere formalities as they attempt to get their man signed up in time for the pre-season tour of the United States. After that, will come the small matter for Mbeumo of choosing his shirt number for the forthcoming season and beyond.",
      "Fortunately for the Cameroonian, his two favoured numbers are both vacant and available to him. Domestically, he has often chosen the No.19 shirt while internationally he wears the No.20.",
      "Whichever route he decides to take, he will be following the path well-trodden by a couple of United icons. The No.19 shirt, for example, was worn by Dwight Yorke during the sensational 1999 treble season.",
      "While not synonymous with either man, both Edwin van der Sar and Marcus Rashford donned the shirt number when they were first making their mark at the Theatre of Dreams. Rashford's seemingly inevitable exit from United and the manner in which it has unfolded may sting now but over time his breakthrough into the first team will likely be lauded.",
      "However, should Mbeumo choose the No.20 shirt he would follow in the footsteps of a player who also traded the capital for the north west but perhaps under more controversial circumstances. Robin van Persie made the shirt his own during his time with the Reds and will always be looked back upon fondly after trading Arsenal for United.",
      "Of course, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mbeumo may go for a different number. The No.14 is currently available should he fancy a change but whichever he decides to choose, the same expectations will be thrust upon him."

Romelu Lukaku ticked most of the boxes yet he continued to be a peripatetic striker. Radamel Falcao and Anthony Martial were two gambles from Monte Carlo that bust.",
      "And United also have form for settling any Tom, Dick, Harry or Wout. For all the mitigation surrounding the loan arrival of Weghorst in January 2023, opting for another Dutchman who grew up in the same district as the manager was beneath them. Weghorst was playing on loan in Turkey, having riled teammates and supporters at recently relegated Burnley. He scored as many goals for United as Burnley - two tap-ins.",
      "The Weghorst deal was reminiscent of Odion Ighalo's deadline day move in January 2020. Ighalo was playing in China, back when the country's Super League was teeming with Premier League cast-offs, and he was represented by a Norwegian agent who was the same nationality as the United manager.",
      "Ighalo and Weghorst were brought in as the support striker to Martial. Banking on Martial three years apart and under two managers is one of innumerable reasons why United are in the state that they are.",
      "As recently as January, United gave consideration to signing Mathys Tel, a peripheral forward who barely scored for Bayern Munich. Yet United have a penchant for taking surplus squad players from Bayern.",
      "On the basis of the Ighalo and Weghorst deals, any striker with a Portuguese connection should instruct their agent to dial 0161. Ominously, Portugal international Joao Felix is still technically a Chelsea player."

Consequently, Garnacho has been absent from United's pre-season preparations.",
      "Instead, the winger - along with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho - has been told to report to Carrington for training at 5pm, after the first team have finished their session. So far, United have been unable to arrange a transfer for any of the players they wish to offload.",

      "However, the Red Devils have endured a frustrating few weeks in the transfer market as they have struggled to reach a breakthrough in talks with Premier League rivals Brentford over Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United have made it their priority to overhaul their attack after they were toothless in forward positions, as they struggled to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s preferred formation.",
      "Mbeumo, like Cunha, would be an upgrade on United’s current No.10 options after the Brentford standout scored 20 Premier League goals last season.",

      "READ: Man Utd ‘close’ to sealing ‘bargain’ next signing as Prem star has ‘everything ready’ to join",
      "However, a deal for Mbeumo has proven difficult as Brentford can demand a sizable fee. The forward is only under contract until 2026, but they have an option to extend his deal on the same terms until 2027.",
      "Man Utd have already had a couple of bids rejected for Mbeumo this summer and a deal has stalled in recent weeks.",
      "It has also been reported that the Bees are unwilling to lose Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa this summer, but the latter is attracting fresh interest from Newcastle United.",
      "This appears to have alerted Man Utd, who made an ‘improved bid’ for Mbeumo on Thursday afternoon.",

      "‘The latest proposal is worth £65million plus £5m and is awaiting a response from the London club.’",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has provided more details on this offer, claiming this is United’s ‘final’ offer.",
      "He tweeted: ‘Manchester United consider their third bid for Bryan Mbeumo as ‘final’. Prepared to engage around if it not outright accepted, but not anticipating going significantly above their latest valuation.",
      "‘Bryan Mbeumo has also indicated again he wants to leave.’",
      "Appearing on The United Stand, Jacobs also revealed United ‘will walk away’ if this offer is turned down, while Mbeumo has issued a one-word response to this proposal.",
      "The United Stand tweeted his comments, revealing: ‘Not only are Man United optimistic of getting the deal done, Bryan Mbeumo himself has told Brentford he thinks the offer is fair, and the move should happen before the USA tour.",
      "‘If Brentford outright reject the third bid and say it’s not near the valuation structure, then Man United will walk away.’",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed that Man Utd have increased their offer to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer.",
      "It’s a Manchester United-heavy Mediawatch today, with absolutely everything (absolutely nothing) changing in their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "",
      "15) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern have made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool won’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, but £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, but it feels very unlikely the two clubs will compromise while they stand £30million apart in their current valuations. Diaz may have to force the issue.",

      "14) Pervis Estupinan – Brighton to Manchester United\nUnited have held talks with the left-back, according to Talksport, though AC Milan are also sniffing around a player Brighton seem happy to sell since they’ve already bought Maxim De Cuyper from Club Brugge. The one signing they made in January was a left wing-back, though Patrick Dorgu showed almost nothing in his half-season so far.",
      "",
      "13) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "12) Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nWith Arsenal looking to sign players in the positions Trossard plays, it makes sense that they cash in on the attacker. Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere…",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "9) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. And since Liverpool were prepared to go way above that for Isak, Eintracht will try to squeeze Liverpool for all they are worth, even if Ekitike is keen to move to Anfield.",
      "",
      "3) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have progress! United have submitted their third and final offer of £65million plus £5million in add-ons. If they hadn’t fannied about for a month, they could have saved themselves those bonus payments. Still, the widespread belief is that Brentford will accept this new bid. Even though it would be hilarious if they don’t.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "READ: Mediawatch: Brentford ‘U-turn’ on Mbeumo as three Man United transfers solve everything",

But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold.",

      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham doesn’t think Rashford deserves a move to Barcelona after failing to perform for the Red Devils in recent times.",

From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that’s a step up that he hasn’t deserved.”",
      "On the need to sell before Man Utd can buy, Sheringham added: “Manchester United did a lot of business at the start of the window – they got Matheus Cunha in and there was also talk about Bryan Mbeumo joining from Brentford. It was an exciting time, and it sounded like they’d have a right go this summer, but then it stagnated.",
      "“This stagnation has probably got a lot to do with the players that need to get out of the door this summer. When you’re trying to get players out of your football club that don’t want to be there, that’s probably one of the hardest parts of management, especially when they are on big money.",
      "“There is a lot of money they need to get off the wage bill before they start buying more players. The owners probably thought it would be easier to offload these players to other clubs, but they’re finding it hard – that’s the problem.”",

      "It’s a Manchester United-heavy Mediawatch today, with absolutely everything (absolutely nothing) changing in their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Learn to turn\nThe Mirror bring us the latest update from Manchester United’s frankly interminable quest to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "MBEU-NO! Brentford star’s protracted Man Utd transfer takes fresh U-turn as new Bees boss Andrews puts his foot down with Red Devils wanting to wrap up deal",
      "That’s the almost Mail-length headline that parps out at you from the Mirror’s football homepage this morning.",
      "The story itself has a slightly less parpy version, but it says much the same thing.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo to Man Utd transfer U-turn as manager privately changes things",
      "Mediawatch has largely given up on its dispiritingly futile campaign Words Have Meanings but we can’t help but reopen it for one day only.",
      "We’ve learned to be wary of assuming anything, but we are reasonably confident that the idea of a U-turn is widely understood. It represents at the very least a significant change in policy or point or view and ideally a complete reversal from that previously held position.",
      "As the Mirror themselves state, the problem for United getting the Mbeumo deal done has been that Brentford have stuck to their initial valuation and refused to budge.",
      "The Red Devils have seen several bids for the Cameroon forward rejected, the last being £60million, with the Bees sticking robustly to their valuation. The two parties remain millions apart in their respective figures and the change in the dugout has not helped.",
      "So what’s changed from the Brentford side here to represent a U-turn? Over to their director of football Phil Giles.",
      "‘We’ve made our point clear. If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.’",
      "So Brentford’s position has U-turned all the way from ‘We are willing to sell him but only at a price that’s right for us’ to ‘We are willing to sell him but only at a price that’s right for us’.",
      "It’s all driving us round the U-bend.",
      "",
      "Tag nuts\nThe Mbeumo nonsense doesn’t end there, we’re afraid. It’s off to The Sun next on this magical mystery tour.",
      "Man Utd ‘refusing to be held to ransom’ as Brentford increase price tag for 20-goal star Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Have they? Have their increased their asking price? Let’s see.",
      "According to The Guardian, at the end of June Man Utd director of football, Jason Wilcox, believed a package of £65m would be enough to strike a deal.",
      "But since then, Brentford have raised their price for the attacker – who reported for pre-season training this week – closer to £70m.",
      "Not quite, is it? Clearly, £65m isn’t a number Man United have plucked out of thin air, but their believing it would be enough doesn’t mean Brentford’s actual asking price being ‘closer to £70m’ constitutes an increase in price tag.",
      "While we’re here, we’re also going to point out that wanting to buy a footballer for one price and his current football club insisting the actual price is slightly higher actually does not in any way constitute being ‘held to ransom’.",
      "Now Mediawatch has pointed that out, we know we can sit back comfortably, secure in the knowledge we will never ever see it again. It’s always worked that way before when we grind our teeth to dust about this kind of thing.",
      "Still, though. There’s undeniably an interesting dynamic that is present in almost all the reports around Mbeumo and Brentford and United today, and that’s the framing of Brentford as being the problem.",
      "Their position with regards to any potential sale of Mbeumo has been almost entirely consistent and thoroughly reasonable (‘We’ll sell, but only at our price’) throughout the summer, yet they are the ones portrayed as moving the goalposts with non-existent or wildly exaggerated U-turns and price-tag chicanery.",
      "Mediawatch cheerfully admits to being a massive cynic yet also tries to avoid ever descending too far down Tinfoil Hat Alley. But it’s impossibly tempting this morning to see the hand of one club attempting to steer the media towards a certain narrative here, if one is so inclined.",

      "One of Manchester United’s weakest squad areas is now their strongest after three transfers",
      "One area of the Manchester United squad that almost certainly will not be addressed this summer is central defence.",

      "That’s where the headline came from, anyway.",
      "After Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt joined in the summer, Ayden Heaven followed in the winter. In between, the one-year extension in Harry Maguire’s contract was triggered.",
      "Once Lisandro Martinez has recovered from his anterior cruciate ligament injury, United will have five specialist centre halves with an average age of 24. Two are homegrown and three from overseas.",
      "That’s a fairly liberal coating of gloss applied to a brutal injury. Not United’s fault, of course, but the idea that the centre-back cupboards are overflowing while such a key defender is recovering from such a significant injury feels slightly over-optimistic.",
      "But it’s that average age we’re interested in. The devil is in the detail when it comes to average age, because 24 sounds absolutely ideal doesn’t it? That’s a great age for a player, carrying as it does the idea of having reached a particular level of experience and ability to be a reliable senior first-team player, while also still potentially approaching the peak with many years still ahead of you.",
      "Of course you want lots of 24-year-old players. But an average age of 24 doesn’t actually mean lots of players who are 24. And in the case of the five players here, you’re actually looking at players who are 18, 19, 25, 27 and 32. That’s suddenly two very inexperienced teenagers, one player nearing the end of his career and only two at or approaching their potential peak, one of whom is also on the road back from a very, very serious injury.",
      "Centre-back is absolutely not be the most pressing area of Man United concern right now, but we’d humbly contend that this is because other areas are more conspicuously f*cked than United having locked this particular area down for the next decade by being so brilliant.",
      "",
      "Strike it lucky\nAnd this Daily Express headline caught Mediawatch’s eye this morning",

      "The start of a new Premier League season means one thing.",
      "Well, that’s not true. It means several things. But among those things is managers being under pressure, sacked and replaced. It is a tale as old as time.",
      "So we decided to have a little look at the current Sack Race market and then predict who the under-pressure managers might be replaced by should such replacements be needed.",
      "It was going to be a top five, but then there were two managers joint fifth so it became a top six. Then we noticed that the three managers joint seventh were at Newcastle, Manchester United and West Ham all of which felt interesting in one way or another, so it became a top nine.",
      "So nine it is. Always the best number for a feature, in our experience.",
      "We’re not saying all, or even most, of these nine managers will fall. But we’d be staggered if at least a few of them aren’t out on their ear by Christmas. And these are their guaranteed (not a guarantee) replacements…",
      "",
      "Newcastle\nOUT: Eddie Howe\nIN: Jose Mourinho",
      "We’ve been slightly thrown by this one. After years of desperate and very childish attempts from us to manifest some kind of Howe Sack narrative from thin air, we’d reluctantly accepted that delivering the longest-awaited silverware and finishing in the top five to bag a return to Champions League football would end any hope of that for at least several months.",
      "And now a Howe Sack narrative appears to have manifested from thin air. We don’t believe it for a second. Surely not.",
      "But football is football and unthinkably harsh and/or stupid things happen all the time. The sense remains that if Newcastle did move on from Howe it would be from a desire to elevate the brand and the name to the next level, which would mean going down the kind of Elite Serial Winner route that definitely always works and is definitely always a good idea.",
      "It still feels like Mourinho has unfinished business and scores to settle in the Barclays, and probably there will always be unfinished business and scores to settle in the Barclays for Mourinho. Because if he does turn up to finish that business and settle those scores he will inevitably being some new business and scores.",
      "He can’t help himself. And maybe neither can Newcastle.",
      "",
      "West Ham\nOUT: Graham Potter\nIN: Gareth Southgate",
      "It does seem far easier to envision a scenario where Graham Potter gets himself very quickly in very deep trouble at West Ham. He’s not been there long but has no real credit in the bank, while Howe has absolutely loads of it.",
      "We’ve said before that Potter and West Ham are perhaps the most interesting manager-club storyline of all heading into this season, because it feels like the one with the biggest range of realistic possible outcomes.",
      "Potter sacked by October feels entirely believable. Potter winning three manager of the month awards in a row with West Ham third in the table in October feels entirely believable too.",
      "But if it is indeed the former, where do West Ham turn next? They’ve tried Moyes and a Spanish Moyes and didn’t care for either. They’ve tried a coach’s coach. Again, does feel like the next step could be almost anything from anywhere.",
      "Almost every other name we’ve got on this list for someone else also feels like they could very much also end this season in the London Stadium dugout with all bubbles floating around them.",
      "We’re going with Gareth Southgate, though. A man so indelibly linked with the England job is perfect for a club that still bases around 63 per cent of its identity on ‘winning the World Cup’ in 1966. The remaining 37 per cent is split between Danny Dyer, the aforementioned bubbles, and disliking Tottenham. Just if you were wondering.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nOUT: Ruben Amorim\nIN: Xavi",
      "It does rather look like Sir Scrooge McRatcliffe and his merry band of disruptors might be making another complete bollocks of another summer, which is absolutely delicious.",
      "They’ve managed to sign precisely one first-team player for a squad in very obvious need of far more significant surgery to give the manager they chose knowing full well how his teams played any kind of fighting chance of success.",
      "Matheus Cunha is a wonderful player, and we’re very excited to see him step up to a big club. But there’s also no denying that part of that excitement is because he is a very loose maverick who is liable to do something very batsh*t that, combined as it now is with the Manchester United spotlight, comes to dominate the news agenda for several days/weeks.",
      "And… that’s it. That’s all they’ve managed to do. Ruben Amorim, the manager in most obviously conspicuous need of getting a squad that is his and a pre-season with them is going to get neither of those things. And he’s still going to have Casemiro as his midfielder by the looks of it.",
      "So yes, the chance of another managerial search on the red side of Manchester this season is definitely very, very real, and there are only so many viable candidates for a club with their wild combination of heft and stupidity.",
      "It’s starting to look a little bit like it might almost be an impossible job, on the straightforward basis that anyone who’s actually willing to take it on has already in that act itself proved themselves unsuitable.",
      "So who knows where United turn next if turn they must. We’ve gone for Xavi on the basis that he is currently available and thus doesn’t require buying out of any current contract and does at least have ample experience of dealing with a football club that is ridiculously massive and massively ridiculous.",
      "",
      "Wolves\nOUT: Vitor Pereira\nIN: Sergio Conceicao",
      "Because he is Portuguese and a football manager. Next.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest\nOUT: Nuno Espirito Santo\nIN: Edin Terzic",
      "Easy to forget in the middle of a summer when Evangelos Marinakis has been so busy grassing up Crystal Palace to UEFA and throwing a strop because someone found out about a release clause that towards the end of last season he was having on-pitch arguments with the manager who had turned his relegation-threatened club into European challengers.",
      "So yes, while it may seem ridiculous it is entirely fair to say Nuno Espirito Santo is indeed Ralph Wiggum sat on a school bus at this point. Especially if the delicate balancing act between domestic and European exertions proves taxing. Especially as those European exertions will now be at the higher Europa League level.",
      "Simply being in Europe at all raises another problem for Nuno on the ‘victim of own success’ front in that it does mean the potential for Forest to be looking at a different level of manager than they could have considered previously.",
      "Former Dortmund manager Terzic is one such, and a man who has knocked about the top 10 contenders lists for at least half-a-dozen Premier League jobs in the last couple of years.",
      "",
      "Burnley\nOUT: Scott Parker\nIN: Sean Dyche",
      "When Scott Parker’s guileless attempts to bring his new sufferball antics from Championship to Premier League go inevitably and catastrophically awry, why do anything other than bring in the absolute master to show how it’s done. Step aside, McDonald’s Boy. This is job for gravel voices, disc beards and lard.",
      "",
      "Sunderland\nOUT: Regis Le Bris\nIN: Gary O’Neil",
      "O’Neil’s burgeoning reputation took a pretty hefty hit last season, especially when his failure to get anything out of that talented Wolves squad was compounded by Vitor Pereira getting a really quite compelling tune out of them for a really quite extended period of time, but he is still a man who despite limited Premier League experience has received two hospital passes and managed to make a decent job of both.",
      "Bournemouth and Wolves both looked in a dreadful mess when he took over and, while both have now taken leaps forward since moving on from O’Neil they would both surely acknowledge that they wouldn’t be in the position they are without his firefighting efforts.",
      "It’s a very useful skill – and reputation – to have. Every Premier League season now that doesn’t begin with O’Neil already gainfully employed will inevitably see him instantly linked with any club that quickly appears to be beyond all help.",
      "And this season that could be a lot of clubs. For ease, we’re just going with the most obvious here, with O’Neil set in our minds to replace Regis Le Bris as early as mid-September just days after Speaking Well, I Thought on MNF about the avoidable errors the Black Cats made in a 7-0 defeat at Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Brentford \nOUT: Keith Andrews\nIN: Kjetil Knutsen",
      "We wish Keith Andrews absolutely no ill will and would be delighted to be proved entirely and decisively wrong on this one, but we simply cannot recall a managerial appointment or set of circumstances more obviously doomed to failure.",
      "The desire for continuity is admirable, but continuity of coaching only really works if you also have continuity of players, and that is not a luxury the Premier League’s biggest clubs are minded to allow Brentford at this time.",
      "The other problem with promoting from within is that it also doesn’t really work if your departing manager takes five of his senior backroom staff with him to his new job and you end up having to promote the set-piece coach.",
      "Sure, we all know that set-piece coaches are the order of the day right now because of that fella at Arsenal who tells Declan Rice to take good corners and free-kicks, but we’re not really sure the set-piece coach is the obvious manager-in-waiting in any sensible coaching set-up.",
      "What Brentford surely needed was a manager with some experience of actual management, and notably of overachieving with a smaller club.",
      "Kjetil Knutsen has done all that and more in his transformative time at the helm of Bodo/Glimt, a club who have come to dominate Norwegian football without any of the usual surrounding unpleasantnesses that come with teams that emerge from basically nowhere to dominate a country’s football.",
      "",
      "Leeds\nOUT: Daniel Farke\nIN: Ange Postecoglou",
      "Leeds’ last successful crack at Premier League football didn’t last all that long but it was absolutely joyous while it did.",
      "The inspirational Marcelo Bielsa got Leeds back into the Premier League and then kept them there with great ease and enormous style. Leeds would eventually finish ninth in the 2020/21 table having given the season many of its most memorable moments.",
      "They scored more goals than fourth-placed Chelsea, and conceded more goals than 16th-placed Brighton.",
      "It all unravelled the following season, but forget about that for now. The point is that the last time Leeds had a good Premier League season, which is also the only time Leeds have had a good Premier League season since the very earliest days of the 21st century, they did it by unapologetically playing front-foot, attack-first-and-ask-questions-later football that led to more than enough memorably thrilling wins to counteract the inevitably dismal-looking defeats that attempting such football at such an elevated level inevitably brings.",
      "In short: it’s who they were, mate.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made the ‘fastest move’ as they look to fend off competition from rivals to sign a £45m Premier League star.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘weighing up’ a ‘reunion’ for one of Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP stars, as it’s felt they will ‘listen to offers’.",
      "That an access-all-areas documentary about Man Utd next season was given the consideration it was shows again the size of the job before Ruben Amorim…",
      "Why are giving Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim excuses to be terrible? Plus, more on Spurs, Arsenal and Diogo Jota."

Garnacho publicly questioned the decision, and his brother followed with comments of his own. The relationship with manager Ruben Amorim deteriorated from there.",

Last month, he posted a photo of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford’s name and number on the back.

      "2) Liverpool actually worry me a little.",
      "Liverpool buying attackers, attacking midfielders and attacking full backs looks lovely on paper..",
      "Selling Quansah (the new Van Dijk for me – but seems Arne disagrees) Nat (head breeze blocks all day, love that lad) Philips and Konate looking to be off (what’s happened behind the scenes that Trent, Ibou and Diaz have all decided this is not the club for them? That worries me a little too) leave us with Virgil and Joe (Made from the bits of Darren Anderton that still work) Gomez and Rhys Williams, who hasn’t really managed to step up in the few chances he’s had",
      "Titles are generally won based on a good defence and while we might score plenty this year, the defensive side really does concern me (unless the plan is to play Alli and Marmalade together and only 9 outfielders……)",
      "I also totally agree that Darwin will score 30-40 goals this year, for someone, He just can’t be as unlucky (yes yes he was! stop laughing at the back) as he was last year. Part of me wants him to stay and become the cult legend that he should be.",
      "I can’t see us signing Isak, this seems quite indecisive for us at the moment. Lots of actual strikers on the market unusually this year and people seems not to want them for some reason, Sesko, Gyokeres, Ekitike, Osimhen etc etc",
      "If you really need a striker, they are there to be purchased, Why are we trying to buy one that isn’t (allegedly) for sale in Isak and risk getting no one?\nAl – LFC Should be fun season for sure. Chelsea look good (though will be knackered?) and Arse may have a striker.. City are City all the boxes ticked for a title race.. but can we DEFEND it.. literally and metaphorically",

      "Liverpool title is enough, actually\nTwo things can be true at once. Liverpool can be spending at an unprecedented level, for their history. And winning ‘just’ a Premier League will be more than good enough in the coming season.",
      "The first point doesn’t need a lot of explaining. Anyone who’s ever spent much time in the mailbox knows there’ve been endless Liverpool net spend, salary spend, discussion since the mid 2000s at least. That’s because, for all of them being one of the biggest clubs in the world since Shankly did his thing, they’ve rarely spent like it. Hells, they’ve rarely had the ability to spend like it.",
      "When we were linked to Wirtz, I didn’t believe it. And continued to not really believe until it was firmly established as happening. And this is after bidding a billion on Caicedo a couple of years ago. The idea we’d get one of the best and brightest in the world is just foreign to me. I’m used to them either being much younger (and bigger gambles) previously failed (and so not trusted) or just being a relative unknown.",

      "I can tell you honestly that never made me personally entitled. I have always found the specific moments and the experiences bigger than the actual trophy presentations. Hard to explain but Macheda scoring against Villa is a much bigger memory for me at OT than any of the title presentations. Raw emotion. Same recently with Maguire against Lyon watching it on TV. Not winning Europa in the end was disappointing obviously, but that moment was very special.",
      "For me as well, Henry and Bergkamp were two of the most special players to ever play the game. I can see a bit beyond blind loyalty. So with all this said just wanted to say that hand on heart, I cannot believe in a sports, business, hobby or even a fantasy gaming environment that anyone could do a worse job of running a football club than Sir Jim Radcliffe. We are extremely lucky that football really is not “life or death”.",

      "Some of you need to think how long a drunk conversation takes in a pub to come up with a list of players you could realistically sign for your club and how much they would cost and then translate that in to ultra high value individuals backed by legal council doing it. It is a disgrace that an institution like Manchester United can ever have been brought to this. Please feel free to laugh at us but at some point, it would be good to worry about if it can happen to us who is next?

All our best players since the Abu Dhabi era like Kompany, Aguero, Kevin, Rodri, Haaland etc were all bought, not developed. Barcelona seem to actively push their academy players in the playing 11, our academy seems to be a sort of profit machine i.e. A mini Benfica or Dortmund.",
      "It’s a bit sad to see these players like James McAtee come to the realisation, that after so many years at the academy, it’s next to impossible to get in the playing 11. I feel that Foden could burn the PL if he played for United or Tottenham, where he would probably be the biggest star. Here it will be difficult for a mercurial no 10, simply because it will be his responsibility to feed the best striker in the world. If he doesn’t do that properly enough, Cherki and Reijnders are just waiting for that spot.",

They are working on easy and difficult add-ons, trying to make Brentford happy with their final proposal. So Man United are still on it. The Bryan Mbeumo deal is absolutely alive at this moment.”",

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Thursday 17 July 2025 16:44, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, as is Brentford considering the club's latest offer of £70m in total.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",

      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson of Chelsea is another situation United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
