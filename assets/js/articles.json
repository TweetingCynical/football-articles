      "Manchester United's players go into the international break off the back of a first league win of the season, taking some of the pressure off head coach Ruben Amorim. A defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup had left Amorim's future under scrutiny, but a last-gasp penalty from Bruno Fernandes gave the Red Devils all three points.",
      "The match didn't pass without further injury concerns, though. Neither Matheus Cunha nor Mason Mount was able to complete the full 90 minutes, with Cunha pulling out of Brazil's squad for the September World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Bolivia.",
      "United return to action on September 14, taking on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. They go into the match ahead of their local rivals, who suffered back-to-back league defeats after winning their opener away at Wolves.",
      "United have been dealt a fresh injury scare after Diogo Dalot pulled out of Portugal's squad for the September international break. Roberto Martinez's team face a trip to Armenia on Saturday, followed by another away game against Hungary.",
      "Dalot played the full 90 minutes on Saturday as United beat Burnley. However, he has been released from Portugal duty with former Arsenal man Nuno Tavares taking his place.",
      "\"Full-back Nuno Tavares was called up to the National Senior squad this Thursday to replace Diogo Dalot. The international, who plays for Manchester United, complained of muscle discomfort and was released by the Health and Performance Unit,\" a statement from Portugal's FA read.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has recognised the increase in quality after trading the Bundesliga for the Premier League. Sesko joined United from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million, and has yet to score for his new club, but feels he's getting closer.",
      "\"The level of the matches is certainly much higher, the players and teammates are also at a higher level,\" the Slovenia star told Ekipa. After all, English football is at the highest level in the world of football.",
      "\"But I am very much looking forward to the coming period, also because I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day. I wanted to move to England and fortunately my wish came true.”",
      "Erik ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen payout means he cost the club over £86,000 for each day he was in charge, according to Bild. The former Manchester United boss decided in May that Leverkusen would be his first managerial job since leaving Old Trafford last October, but he was gone after just 60 days.",
      "\"This decision was not an easy one for us,\" Leverkusen director for sport Simon Rolfes said when Ten Hag got his marching orders after just two league games. \"Nobody wanted to take this step.",
      "\"However, the past few weeks have shown that building a new and successful team with this setup is not feasible. We firmly believe in the quality of our team and will now do everything we can to take the next steps in our development with a new setup.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wrexham brought in 13 new players during the summer transfer window after spending a whopping £33million. The window closed on Monday as the Red Dragons recruited three fresh faces on deadline day.",
      "Midfielder Ben Sheaf was signed from Coventry City for a reported fee of £6.5m, while Blackburn Rovers defender Dominic Hyam joined in a deal worth £2.7m. The Hollywood-owned club also secured a move for Manchester City wing-back Issa Kabore on a season-long loan.",
      "The closure of the window brought to an end a busy period for manager Phil Parkinson, but Wrexham could still do further business. The Championship new boys announced on Thursday that they have registered 24 players for this season, leaving a space open for a potential free agent signing.",
      "There were some notable names absent from the list, including goalkeeper Danny Ward, who faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after suffering an elbow injury against Millwall last weekend. Midfielders Ollie Rathbone and Andy Cannon and striker Jay Rodriguez were also left out as they battle with their own injuries.",
      "Meanwhile defender Eoghan O'Connell's future at Wrexham has been thrown into doubt following his exclusion from the squad. Whether Parkinson decides to fill the vacancy with another new arrival remains to be seen, but it would not be surprising after he added Matty James and Jon Dadi Bodvarsson as free agents last season.",
      "Former England midfielder Dele Alli has found himself without a club once more following the mutual termination of his contract at Como after featuring just once for the Serie A outfit. Dele joined the Italian side on a free transfer in January on an 18-month deal, and was hoping to revive his career after an extended absence caused by injuries, addiction and mental health struggles.",
      "However, the 29-year-old's spell with Como turned into a nightmare when he received a red card less than ten minutes after coming off the bench during Cesc Fabregas' team's 2-1 loss to AC Milan at the San Siro in March. Wrexham, owned by Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, are now among the bookies' favourites to sign Dele and help get him back on track.",
      "He was previously a crucial player for Tottenham and has earned 37 caps for his country, helping to guide them to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals. Dele's pedigree could therefore prove useful for Wrexham as they aim to reach the Premier League.",
      "Wrexham made a bold move to sign Christian Eriksen during the summer following his departure from Manchester United. Despite being impressed by the club's offer, the 33-year-old rejected the opportunity to relocate to North Wales after expressing his preference to continue playing at the highest level.",
      "However, with the Danish international still unattached, Wrexham could be tempted to revisit their interest. Eriksen, whose career includes stints at Ajax, Tottenham, Inter Milan and Brentford, boasts an impressive CV.",
      "Eriksen is currently reported to be training with Swedish side Malmo as he continues his search for a new club. It would represent a significant signing for Wrexham if they could tempt him to make the move.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Wrexham also have the opportunity to explore another previous target in Patrick Bamford following the striker's release from Leeds United. The 31-year-old, who boasts one England cap, recently left the Premier League newcomers by mutual agreement after a seven-year stint at Elland Road.",
      "It followed news last month from manager Daniel Farke that Bamford was not in his plans for the current season and would be expected to train with the under-21s if he chose to stay. Upon leaving Leeds, Bamford confessed to feeling \"raw\".",
      "If Wrexham did choose to sign him, they'd be getting a player who scored 60 goals in 205 appearances for the Whites following his £7m switch from Middlesbrough in 2018. Bamford has achieved promotion from the Championship twice with Leeds and shone during their initial return to the Premier League in 2020, bagging 17 goals.",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",

      "Manchester United have suffered a fresh injury blow after Diogo Dalot was sent home from international duty by Portugal. Dalot, 26, becomes the Red Devils' third injury woe in the space of the week after Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount were both forced off during Saturday's dramatic 3-2 win at home to Burnley.",
      "In a statement released on Thursday, the Portuguese Football Federation said: \"Full-back Nuno Tavares was called up to the National Senior squad this Thursday to replace Diogo Dalot. The international, who plays for Manchester United, complained of muscle discomfort and was released by the Health and Performance Unit.\"",
      "The news comes after Cunha updated fans by saying that he'll be 'back soon'. The forward was forced to pull out of Brazil's squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers.",
      "\"What an incredible environment, it's great to be here,\" Cunha posted on Instagram. \"Ill be back soon, always with joy and gratitude. Thanks for all the messages.\"",
      "Amorim expressed his concerns about both Cunha and Mount - the latter of whom came off at half-time - following the victory over Burnley, United's first win of the season. \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "\"I don't know [if the pair suffered long-term injuries], I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",
      "Amorim will hope to have both players available as soon as possible, with United due to play local rivals Manchester City following the international break. The Red Devils will then face Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the next international fixtures in October.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Cunha, who United paid Wolves £62.5million to sign in June, has impressed Amorim in his short time at the club, where it's been a difficult start to the campaign, with two defeats and one draw before the Burnley match. \"He's a loud guy that's really important in this moment,\" the Red Devils boss said.",
      "\"When he's upset, you can feel it in the environment and that's good. When you play some games and he loses, he's a different guy, and that's good. He has some characteristics that we miss last season, so I'm really happy with him and the other guys.\"",

      "Michael Owen has told fans he's in no doubt Manchester United will be sticking by Ruben Amorim. That's despite claims from Phil Jones that some of the head coach's current crop potentially \"don't like him\".",
      "Not only has Amorim been able to spend more than £200million at leisure to improve his squad, recruiting the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but he's had a full pre-season tour to prepare the team for the season ahead. Former Red Devils striker Owen has reminded people that it's a sign the club's top brass are standing by Amorim.",
      "In conversation with A Bola, 45-year-old Owen said: \"I think Manchester United is a patient club. Of course, they can't go year after year without doing things well. Man United gave Ruben Amorim almost a year, and it was a very poor year in the Premier League.",
      "\"They've never finished so low in the table. Many clubs would say that's not enough, that they need a new manager. But Manchester United stuck with him, and I think it's a good decision.",
      "\"They spent a lot of money, which shows they have confidence in him. You hear all kinds of rumours, but not about the club wanting to change. They're showing loyalty, that they believe in the manager. I believe that, in the short term, Ruben Amorim still has the club's trust.\"",
      "With a loss, a draw and a win to show for their efforts against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley respectively this season thus far in the Premier League, United fans may harbour questions with regards to if Amorim is indeed the right man for the job. Meanwhile, a shock Carabao Cup exit to League Two's Grimsby Town last month piled further pressure on the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite never having played under Amorim, given that Ten Hag was still at the helm of the Red Devils when he called time on his own footballing career, Jones believes that there may be unrest within Amorim's camp. Speaking to Ladbrokes, the centre-half, who racked up 229 appearances for United between 2011 and 2023, said: \"Do I think there were players at United who didn’t like him?",
      "\"To be honest, that's probably a ridiculous question because I’d say there are people in the United team now who don’t like the manager. But there are probably players at Man City who feel the same way about [Pep] Guardiola; they can’t stand him.",
      "\"There are people like that in every team; these are big groups of players and different personalities, and all of them are competitive, and think they should be playing more than they are. That will never, ever change.",
      "\"Even when a manager is flying, there will always be someone going ‘Well, he’s not playing me, so he’s not good.' Trust me, I’ve been there myself. I’ve been a young kid moaning about training being rubbish. But in reality it’s not rubbish; you’re just hurt and you don’t know how to deal with it.\"",
      "Amorim thankfully has a week to tinker with his tactics during the international break before United's next Premier League clash. However, he will have to inspire an incredible performance to get the better of Guardiola's Manchester City when they return to action at the Etihad Stadium for the first Manchester derby of the season on Sunday, September 14.",

      "Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag cost Bayer Leverkusen a huge €100,000 (£86,000) for each day he was in charge of the club, it has been claimed. Ten Hag was sacked by Leverkusen after just three competitive matches, with only two of them coming in the Bundesliga.",
      "Ten Hag was handed a tough task after taking over from Xabi Alonso. Leverkusen cashed in on a number of members of the 2023-24 double-winning squad, including Florian Wirtz and Granit Xhaka, leaving the new boss with a significant rebuild operation on his hands.",
      "He was only given 60 days at the helm, though, with Leverkusen pulling the trigger after the team threw away a 3-1 lead to draw with 10-man Werder Bremen. Ten Hag picked up one point from his two Bundesliga games in charge, though he did oversee a 4-0 cup win away to fourth-tier Sonnenhof Großaspach.",
      "According to Bild, the source of the reported €6m payout figure, Leverkusen were ready to ditch Ten Hag even earlier than that. The publication reports that the boss \"managed to turn all departments, bodies, and players against him in a very short time\".",
      "Even before the sacking was confirmed, Bild report, the club was conducting transfer business without their manager's knowledge. Former Real Madrid defender Lucas Vazquez joined as a free agent after talks with managing director for sport Simon Rolfes, with Ten Hag alleged to have only met the player after a medical was passed and contracts were signed.",
      "\"A parting of ways at this early stage of the season is painful, but we felt it was necessary,\" Leverkusen CEO Fernando Carro said following Ten Hag's dismissal. Rolfes added that: “This decision was not an easy one for us\".",
      "\"Nobody wanted to take this step,\" Rolfes continued. \"However, the past few weeks have shown that building a new and successful team with this setup is not feasible. We firmly believe in the quality of our team and will now do everything we can to take the next steps in our development with a new setup.”",
      "Ten Hag, for his part, was furious the club didn't give him longer to make his mark and pointed to his record of winning silverware in previous jobs. His summer spending came in at just under £150m, with Wirtz accounting for more than half of £200m in sales, with former Premier League stars Mark Flekken and Jarell Quansah among the new arrivals.",
      "“A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play,” the former Ajax boss wrote. “I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret.",
      "“The decision by Bayer Leverkusen’s management this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a coach after just two league matches is unprecedented.",
      "“This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust.",
      "\"A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play. I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret.",
      "“I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust. Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success.",
      "“Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware. Finally, I would like to thank the Bayer Leverkusen supporters for their warmth and passion, and I wish the squad and staff every success for the remainder of the season.\"",

      "In those cameos he's struggled to make much of an impact and is still waiting for his first goal in his new colours. The 22-year-old arrived with a reputation as one of Europe's best young forwards and hit double figures in the Bundesliga last season.",
      "Now in England though Sesko has acknowledged that the demands are far higher with the level of football going up. As a result he's improving as he rubs shoulders with some high quality players and believes his best football will come.",

      "Nevertheless Amorim is adamant that Sesko has a huge ceiling and believes he will enjoy a stellar career at Old Trafford. He said when he signed: “I think he has great potential in everything he does.",

He's going to feel that the Premier League is really aggressive, he's going to learn, but he has a great potential and I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years.

      "Cristiano Ronaldo was disappointed to see Manchester United misfit Antony join Real Betis instead of linking up with him in Saudi Arabia. It's reported that the Old Trafford icon wanted to see Antony as an Al-Nassr player before agreeing on a return to Spain instead.",
      "Antony's tumultuous three-year spell in England officially came to an end on Monday after United agreed a cut-price sale to Betis. The Brazilian spent the latter half of last season on loan in Seville and re-joined Los Verdiblancos for £19million, less than a quarter of the £82m fee United paid Ajax for his services in 2022.",
      "But long before his Betis comeback was signed off, Antony was understood to have been the subject of interest from Ronaldo's Al-Nassr side. And the five-time Ballon d'Or-winner himself is understood to have green-lit the transfer, having spent a brief spell as team-mates with Antony at United.",
      "Appearing on Radio Marca, journalist Marcos Bernat lifted the lid on Al-Nassr's interest in Antony's signature: \"There were negotiations with Al-Nassr, the player heard about the interest, and Cristiano's entourage even took it for granted. At that point, Cristiano was in favour of the move, and they let the player know.\"",
      "In the end, Al-Nassr moved their interest to other targets, such as the more affordable Kingsley Coman. That invited Betis to revisit a deal, which was eventually made a reality on deadline day.",
      "It's believed 2026 World Cup selection was another priority for Antony, making it more of a priority to remain in Europe. Doing so would improve his prospects of being selected by new Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti, who omitted Antony from his latest squad.",
      "The winger cut an emotional figure when he was presented to the Betis fanbase for a second time. Except this time, he had signed for the club on permanent terms and broke down while discussing the difficulties he faced in England.",
      "\"Only my family knows how hard it was to be there,\" said Antony through tears as he was unveiled as Betis' big summer signing on Tuesday. \"Training separately. But I knew this incredible moment was coming. Of course, I was afraid it wouldn't happen in the end, but I waited because I had so much faith.\"",
      "A move to the Saudi Pro League might have given Antony an improved chance of becoming a star once again. But after already impressing during his six-month loan in Spain, he can leave England with confidence that he's in the right environment to rebound under Manuel Pellegrini.",
      "Antony has also since revealed he turned down interest from Bayern Munich in order to move back to Betis. He told Cadena Cope this week: \"One day before the deal was completed, I spoke to the people at Bayern But when I spoke to Bayern, I told them that the deal with Betis was 95% complete, and that I would honour my word.",
      "\"I would do so out of respect and love and because I know that I am very happy here. I don't know if they were offering me [£6m salary, or £115,000 a week]. With all respect I have for Bayern, which is a world-class club, I am at ease with the decision I've taken.

      "Former West Ham captain Kurt Zouma has made the unexpected move of joining Romanian outfit CFR Cluj. French centre-back Zouma was a free agent after leaving the Hammers at the end of June, so would have able to move outside the transfer window, though Romania's window remains open until September 9.",
      "Zouma, 30, played more than 200 Premier League matches for Chelsea, Stoke, Everton and West Ham. He spent last season on loan at Saudi Pro League side Al Orobah, but didn't make the move permanent.",
      "Cluj have signed the Frenchman after finishing second in Romania's SuperLiga last season. However, they missed out on European qualification after defeat against Hacken in the Conference League play-off round.",
      "Zouma's move owes a lot to compatriot Mikael Silvestre. Former Manchester United and Arsenal defender Silvestre is the Romanian club's sporting director, and club president Cristi Balaj spoke about his influence.",
      "\"Mikael Silvestre helps, he helps us in this aspect,\" Balaj said before the signing was confirmed (per DigiSport). \"He comes from a free agent position, I can't give more details.\"",
      "Zouma's move means nine of the 14 players used by West Ham in their 2023 Conference League final victory have now found new clubs. Alphonse Areola, Tomas Soucek, Lucas Paqueta and Jarrod Bowen are the four who remain at the London Stadium, while Michail Antonio remains without a club as he steps up his recovery from serious injury but has been training with the Hammers.",
      "The entire back four from that win against Fiorentina left East London this summer. Vladimir Coufal joined Hoffenheim on a free transfer after his West Ham contract expired, while Nayef Aguerd and Emerson both made deadline day moves to Marseille.",
      "While Zouma's wait for a new club is over, a number of former Premier League stars are still unattached. Among them is Zouma's former West Ham team-mate Lukasz Fabianski, who turned 40 earlier in the year.",
      "Ex-England international Dele Alli is also available to sign for a new club outside the window, having agreed a mutual termination of his Como contract after just one Serie A appearance. Elsewhere, Takehiro Tomiyasu has yet to find a new club after leaving Arsenal, while Christian Eriksen is waiting to decide his next steps after three seasons with Manchester United.",
      "Some other free agents have been more successful, though. Eriksen's former United team-mate Victor Lindelof joined Aston Villa on deadline day, and Jamie Vardy moved abroad for the first time in his career after joining Serie A newcomers Cremonese.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has claimed that he arrives at Napoli as \"a better football player\" following his two years at Manchester United - where he largely underwhelmed before securing his loan switch.",
      "The Dane moved to Old Trafford two years ago in a deal worth £72million, but struggled for much of his time in the Premier League, which prompted the Red Devils to go back into the market this summer to address their goalscoring issues.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came in and relegated Hojlund to a squad role with the ex-Atalanta man failing to appear in the early games of the season, making his exit almost inevitable. It was in Italy that he first made his name and now he'll hope to aid Napoli's ambitions.",
      "He joins the Serie A champions, who have also added Kevin De Bruyne from Manchester City, and is relishing the chance to play in a successful team having been at United during a difficult period. Despite his struggles, which saw him score just for league goals last term, Hojlund is confident he heads to Naples as an improved player.",
      "The 22-year-old told Napoli's club media: “I was very excited, because it’s a team that just won the league. I also know how great the fans are, the city, and I’m very happy for this opportunity. It’s different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I’m a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience.",
      "“I played in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, and in multiple countries. I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.”",
      "Hojlund's deadline day move to Napoli will see the Manchester outfit will receive a £5.2m loan fee and £38m next summer with the Italians having an obligation to buy, provided that Antonio Conte's side qualify for the Champions League, which they are expected to do.",
      "Hojlund has gone straight into Napoli's Champions League squad with Romelu Lukaku left out. The Belgian is current injured and not expected back until the end of the 2025 - leading Conte to avoid taking risks over his fitness. The Italians will take on Manchester City and Chelsea during their European campaign.",
      "Their new signing has already pledged to go above and beyond to prove himself as he said: “I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything.”",

      "Manchester United's new goalkeeper Senne Lammens has vowed to be “a rock” at the back for Ruben Amorim's side. United signed Belgium Under-21 keeper Lammens for an initial £18.2million on deadline day following early-season blunders from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "Lammens is viewed by United as their long-term future No.1 between the posts and the 23-year-old said he can bring calm and stability to Amorm's unreliable and leaky defence.",
      "“I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,” said Lammens. “They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",
      "“My parents are also really calm and collected, but [I also developed this mentality] from growing up, when I was in the youth team and I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life.",
      "“I think one of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.”",
      "Lammens also opened up on the process he goes through before and after every game, and the methods he employs to stay cool under pressure. ”Before and after the game, I just write key words down and my thoughts a little bit,” said United's newest recruit.",
      "“Sometimes, if you don't do that, it can be a lot going through your mind. It helps me with staying calm and staying in the moment a little bit, and not overreacting in situations.",
      "\"I write key words, trigger points. Maybe you're playing a team who put a lot of pressure on and then you know you don't have to think a lot during the games, so mentally you're already ready, already prepared for the game and what it's going to be like. So, when the game comes, you're not going to be so surprised by it. I think that's important.”",
      "The arrival of Lammens has cast doubt on the futures of Bayindir and Onana, with one of them set to leave for a club in Turkey or Saudi Arabia, to bring balance to Amorim's goalkeeper options.",
      "As well as Lammens, Bayindir and Onana, Amorim also has veteran keeper Tom Heaton as part of his squad, with one needing to depart before the transfer windows close elsewhere.",

    "body": [
      "Jeff Stelling claims Manchester United had a \"poor\" transfer window after failing to address major issues. That's despite backing from the board and more than £200million spent on new signings like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"I thought it was absolutely essential and they haven't done so. Yes, they've got Kobbie Mainoo but he hasn't got the sort of legs required to drive that midfield forward.\"",
      "However, Amorim dismissed the idea, saying last month: \"I want Kobbie to stay and he needs to fight for his place. We need Kobbie. That is not going to change. The players not playing with be disappointed but everyone will have opportunities. You have to fight in the week.\"",
      "Mainoo was eventually prevented from departing, yet the Red Devils made minimal efforts to bolster their veteran midfield. Despite prolonged speculation linking them with Carlos Baleba throughout the transfer window, Brighton's eye-watering £100m valuation for the player remained beyond United's reach for now, particularly after Amorim had allocated a substantial chunk of the club's budget towards revamping the attack.",
      "Nevertheless, Stelling also questioned the club's decision to pursue 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who arrived at United in an £18.2m switch from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. While the Red Devils had been connected with Aston Villa's unsettled Emiliano Martinez, they eventually settled on Lammens, who is nine years younger than the Argentine and represents a considerably more economical choice on paper.",
      "Although he offers the advantage of youth to Amorim's roster, he lacks the crucial Premier League know-how that 32-year-old Martinez possesses, considering his stellar performances for Villa across the last five years. And it's precisely this experience that Stelling reckons could have proved invaluable moving forward.",
      "He added: \"And, they've gone for the cheap goalkeeper option. Lammens might turn out to be a fantastic goalkeeper but it's a humungous step for him to go from playing for Royal Antwerp in front of 12,00 people in the Belgian league to huge crowds at Old Trafford. For me, Emi Martinez was the obvious choice for Manchester United.\"",
      "While Amorim claimed he was satisfied with his goalkeeping options earlier in the transfer window, the Portuguese boss appears to have since identified weaknesses in both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana's performances. Bayindir has started all three of United's Premier League matches this campaign, and faced criticism following the Red Devils' disappointing 1-0 opening day defeat to Arsenal.",
      "The 27-year-old made a hash of clearing a corner kick, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to ghost in at the far post and net the winning goal. Meanwhile, Onana was given the nod during United's Carabao Cup encounter with Grimsby Town last month, where he too was slated for mistakes that helped the League Two outfit establish a commanding 2-0 advantage before the interval.",
      "Although strikes from Mbeumo and Harry Maguire levelled proceedings, they were eventually knocked out following a nail-biting penalty shoot-out. United have endured a patchy start to the league campaign with one victory, one defeat and one stalemate from their first three outings, and Amorim will surely be demanding a more spirited display when they return to action after the international break for the Manchester derby come Sunday, September 14.",

      "Michael Owen has opened up on struggling to deal mentally with his decline during the latter stages of his career at Manchester United. The former England striker admits he felt \"embarrassed\" by how dramatically his level fell during the second half of his playing days, admitting it was \"killing him inside”.",
      "Owen burst onto the Premier League scene as a 17-year-old at Liverpool, quickly establishing himself with his lightning pace in behind defences and clinical finishing ability. He claimed the league's golden boot award in his first two full seasons before making his mark on the international stage with a stunning strike against Argentina aged 18 at the World Cup 1998.",
      "After playing a pivotal role in Liverpool's Treble success with the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup in 2001 - which earned him the Ballon d'Or - he secured a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2004.",
      "Owen spent just one campaign in La Liga before his £16.8million switch to Newcastle, where persistent muscle injuries meant he was sidelined for lengthy periods across the following four seasons on Tyneside. His fitness woes continued at Manchester United and later Stoke City, with the striker eventually opting to retire in 2013.",
      "The 45-year-old recently appeared on the Rio Presents podcast, where former Red Devils team-mate Rio Ferdinand asked him about the drop off from going from an elite environment to one that isn’t. Owen instead reflected on his own career, explaining he views it in two distinct halves: pre and post injury troubles.",
      "The pundit said: “Well, I've said before, I mean, I sort of split my career into two. Almost Liverpool and maybe Madrid. And then afterwards, because I just wasn't the same. Not that I didn't like it. I loved it at United. I love you and the lads and whatever.",
      "“But I'm not me. I'm not me. You know what I was when I was 18. And you know what I was when I was 30. It's like, I was half embarrassed. I'm coming out, they've been to these big stadiums, St James' Park, Old Trafford, with my name on my back.",
      "“It's like, can I not just change my name and just think of something, like call me something else? I don't want people to remember me like this. Still good, still scoring. But I'm not what I was. It's killing me. But it's like, what can you do?”",
      "Owen's time at Liverpool saw him score more than 20 goals in all competitions in each season but two. Following his 16-goal haul in 45 appearances for Real Madrid, his numbers plummeted dramatically as injuries mounted and his electric pace diminished.",
      "Speaking about his spells at Newcastle, United and Stoke, he candidly said: “I had it for eight years, when I'm thinking, ‘I don't like this.’ I was looking at the clock half of my career, thinking only 20 minutes. And I could still score. I could still play well.",
      "“I couldn't rip a team's heart out anymore. I could just finish if I get the opportunity. I'm relying on everyone else now. Whereas I used to be able to, I didn't need anyone else. Just give me the ball and I'll do it. And that change of mentality.",
      "“I didn't retire because of my body. I still played in a game the other day. I retired because my mind was about to explode. And I couldn't have it anymore that I was just a Premier League player.”",
      "Though his displays failed to meet his own lofty standards, Owen's time at Manchester United delivered an elusive Premier League trophy in 2010/11, along with another League Cup victory. He ended his career with an impressive record of 222 goals across 482 matches, alongside 40 goals in 89 England appearances.",

      "Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott thinks Ruben Amorim will have left Manchester United by Christmas. The Red Devils started the new season in promising fashion, albeit with a 1-0 loss against Arsenal.",
      "Though this defeat was valiant, and buoyed by recruits Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, the horizon looked bright. A 1-1 draw against Fulham soon darkened such hopes, and a Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby Town was a new low.",
      "A last-gasp 3-2 victory against Burnley followed, but the win was not convincing, and an injury to new man Cunha acted as yet another stain on a campaign still in its infancy. Being knocked out of the League Cup on penalties to a relative minnow brought with it calls for the manager to be sacked. While such suggestions have quieted, Lescott still thinks that by the new year, United will have a new manager.",
      "After the international break, a daunting trip to the Etihad and rivals City beckons for Amorim. Pep Guardiola's side have not started the season well either, and Lescott insists both managers are under duress.",
      "\"The pressure is on for both managers [Amorim and Guardiola],\" stated Lescott on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"Different types of pressure, though.",
      "\"Pep's job isn't under threat, but Amorim's is, yeah,\" continued Lescott before predicting that Amorim will be 'gone by Christmas'. He added: \"I'd be very surprised if he (Amorim) is still there by Christmas. If he is there in January 2026, they're just being stubborn. He looks lost.\"",

      "Lescott, who played at the Etihad from 2009 to 2014 and made 160 appearances, further feels like Amorim's Manchester counterpart, Guardiola, has had his City exit signalled via new recruits.",
      "Asked if City are preparing for life without Guardiola, Lescott responded: \"Yeah, maybe. You're going to have to. The standards may be different this season because it's a new era, you know.",
      "\"When you've got experienced players who have been there for a longer period, they are the ones who get you through tough times. Whereas now, there's [Tijjani] Reijnders, [Rayan] Cherki. They're all experiencing negativity together for the first time. So who is going to get them out of it?",
      "\"I think, like prior to Pep, a lot of this summer's signings are post-Pep. Just like when they signed Kevin [De Bruyne], Delphy [Fabian Delph], Raheem [Sterling], they all signed before Pep arrived, but they were for Pep.\"",
      "Guardiola extended his stay in Manchester late last year by penning a deal that expires in 2027, and he told ESPN: \"After my contract with City, I'm going to stop. I'm sure. I don't know if I'm going to retire, but I'm going to take a break. How I want to be remembered, I don't know.",
      "\"All coaches want to win so we can have a memorable job, but I believe that the fans of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City had fun watching my teams play. I don't think we should ever live thinking about whether we're going to be remembered.\"",

The Portuguese boss has entered his first full season in charge at Old Trafford and was backed to the tune of over £200million this summer.",
      "A promising opening league loss to Arsenal was quickly forgotten after a lacklustre 1-1 draw at Fulham. When Amorim's side met Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, a new low was hit – United crashed out on penalties, and calls for the head coach to be axed bellowed.",

      "\"These are big groups of players and different personalities, and all of them are competitive, and think they should be playing more than they are.",

I've been a young kid moaning about training being rubbish. But in reality, it's not rubbish; you're just hurt and you don't know how to deal with it.",

      "Bruno Fernandes claimed that Alejandro Garnacho didn't \"have the best attitude\" when he broke through the Manchester United youth academy. The 21-year-old has now parted ways with the club altogether after finally securing his move to Chelsea.",
      "The Argentine winger signed his first professional contract with the Red Devils back in 2022 after making the move from Atletico Madrid two years prior. However, United club captain Fernandes claimed Garnacho didn't have the best attitude when he made the step up to the first team under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Speaking in November 2022, after Garnacho scored the winning goal in a Europa League group stage game against Real Sociedad, Fernandes told BT Sport: \"He was good but he knows we expect a lot from him. He’s still really young, doing really well.",
      "“At the beginning of the season, he was not at his best. On the [pre-season] tour he did not have the best attitude. That’s why he didn’t get his chance until now. He’s getting his chances because he’s training better, he’s having the correct attitude.\"",
      "Garnacho received a wealth of opportunity in his first season for the Red Devils, racking up three goals and two assists in the Premier League from 19 appearances. And while the youngster also initially looked to be a part of Ruben Amorim's plans when the Portuguese tactician arrived as Ten Hag's successor, things changed heading into the summer.",
      "Amorim's decision to deem Garnacho surplus to requirements at Old Trafford came after the winger publicly questioned the decision to bench him for the Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Garnacho only came on in the second half of the 1-0 loss in Bilbao. After the match, he told the media: \"Until we reached the final, I played every round.",
      "\"And I played 20 minutes today – I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "He also criticised the club's Premier League campaign as they finished in 15th place, claiming: \"Obviously it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more.\"",
      "As per The Athletic, Amorim is said to have told Garnacho: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer,\" during a training ground discussion ahead of United's final game of the season against Aston Villa, before the player made it clear that Chelsea was his destination of choice.",
      "While the Blues were in no great rush to submit a formal offer for Garnacho, they eventually snagged their man in the latter stages of the summer transfer window, coughing up £40million to take him off United's hands on a long-term contract until 2032.",
      "Taking to Instagram in the wake of his departure, Garnacho was quick to thank the Red Devils and their supporters for his time in the north west.",
      "He wrote: \"Dear Mánchester. After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I’m very grateful for this. To the coaches, staff, and my teammates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had.",
      "\"I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what’s to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",
      "A number of Garnacho's United team-mates were quick to reply to the post, with Kobbie Mainoo writing: \"All the best bro,\" while former Red Devils defender Sam Murray, added: \"All the best hermano,\" and the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Rasmus Hojlund and Fernandes liked the post.",
      "Chelsea fans will unfortunately have to wait a little while before they see Garnacho in action for his new club, given the current international break. The Blues return to action come Saturday, September 13 when they face Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's reason for not signing Gianluigi Donnarumma has emerged following his move to the other side of town. Donnarumma, 26, joined Manchester City on transfer deadline day, costing just £26million from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "PSG made the Italian goalkeeper surplus to requirements after he entered the final 12 months of his contract. There'd been attempts to extend his stay in the French capital but after negotiations turned sour, Luis Enrique shelled out £34m on a replacement - Lucas Chevalier from Lille - signalling the end of Donnarumma's time between the posts at the Parc des Princes.",
      "Reports that United were interested in Donnarumma surfaced after the Club World Cup, where PSG lost the final 3-0 to Chelsea. But it soon became apparent that the Red Devils wouldn't be making an offer for the 26-year-old.",
      "United ultimately opted to sign Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens for an initial £18.2m. The Red Devils also held talks with Aston Villa shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "That gave City a free run at Donnrumma, who they signed for what pundits have hailed as a bargain £26m fee. But it wasn't what PSG demanded for the Italy international which put United off.",
      "Despite costing just £8m less, Lammens' modest salary represents a much cheaper package and someone who can be sold for a greater percentage of profit. The two goalkeepers could make their debuts against one another after the international break, as City welcome United to the Etihad.",
      "\"To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me,\" Donnarumma said. \"I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola.",
      "\"This is a club every player in world football would love to join. I have admired watching Manchester City for many years - so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege.",
      "\"I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates, the staff and the fans. Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been tipped to struggle at Manchester United with Louis Saha calling out his former club for not getting a creative midfielder through the door. Ruben Amorim spent more than £200million on reinforcing his frontline with Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha all arriving.",
      "Sesko himself cost £74m, arrives with a huge reputation and has been tasked with leading the line at Old Trafford. The young Slovenian has been named on the bench for the three Premier League games so far, failing to score in any of his cameos, and Saha is fearful that he may struggle if he does not have the creativity behind him.",
      "United under Amorim play without a playmaker, instead having two central midfielders and two forwards to aid the No 9. Saha insists it is vital that Mbeumo and Cunha hit the ground running with Sesko needing that supply.",
      "“I think he’s capable if the manager managed to get that link between midfield and striker,\" said Saha. \"Unfortunately we didn’t get the midfielder we wanted. So we’re still very weak in that department. And this is why I think Sesko will struggle maybe a little bit until we get that sorted.",
      "“He’s got the quality because he’s tall, he’s going to score goals in the air, and he’s very technical as well. All his movement is right up there, so I’m very confident he’s going to get chances and he’s going to score.",
      "\"But to get us where we want, I don’t think that’s going to be on him. Those two playmakers, (Matheus) Cunha and (Bryan) Mbeumo, will have to kick on very soon, (otherwise) you will see Sesko struggling as well.”",
      "United had struggled in attack in their opening games. In their first two outings they only scored courtesy of an own goal before they hit three past Burnley with Mbeumo getting his first goal in his new colours.",
      "Saha has maintained that United have continued their worrying trend of relying on young, inexperienced strikers to lead their line. The struggles experience by Rasmus Hojlund are well documented. The Dane couldn't deliver on his price tag and has been loaned out after two years.",
      "The Frenchman now fears that the club have simply repeated the trick by signing Sesko who, despite being tipped for big things, is still only 22.",
      "He added, speaking to the Athletic:: “The problems identified over the last three or four years (at United) is having the responsibility as a number nine or as a forward when you’re young. You’re still learning, you’re making mistakes. You don’t how to connect with the players as much as maybe Bruno Fernandes, as much as (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic before, or players like Andy Cole.",
      "“There (was a) combination at Man United to have a young player with a lot of talents, who’s going to disrupt, who’s going to actually bring in unpredictability, but at the same time, you have experience where it’s very valuable and you’re going to actually pass on the information.",
      "\"This is not the case in the last three or four years. So it’s been a really big mistake and I think they’ve done it again.”",

      "Matheus Cunha claimed he'll \"be back soon\" after hobbling off during Manchester United's win over Burnley on Saturday with his injury sparking major concerns for Ruben Amorim. Cunha has been one of the more impressive performers for the Red Devils, despite their indifferent start to the season.",
      "The Brazilian signed from Wolves in the summer but has quickly settled in as he looks for his first United goal. However a hamstring injury saw him hobble off during the first-half at the weekend. Cunha was able to walk out of Old Trafford freely on Saturday night, giving those connected with the club hope that his injury was not as bad as was feared - and now the Brazilian has taken to social media to claim his absence will not be a long-term one.",
      "Having pulled out of the Brazil squad, he said: \"What an incredible environment, it’s great to be here. I’ll be back soon, always with joy and gratitude. Thanks for all the messages.\"",
      "Amorim was evidently concerned at the weekend with Mason Mount also a fitness concern. He said: \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury. I don't know [if they are long-term injuries], I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",
      "United have four points from their opening nine league games but their next assignment is the derby against Manchester City at the Etihad. They will want a full squad if they are to head to the home of their neighbours, who have begun the year slow, and leave with a victory.",
      "Amorim has already underlined his admiration for Cunha and the impact he's made following his £62.5million switch from Molineux. The United boss hailing his competitive spirit and demands he puts on the squad to win.",
      "\"He’s a loud guy that’s really important in this moment,\" said the Portuguese coach. \"When he’s upset, you can feel it in the environment and that’s good. When you play some games and he loses, he’s a different guy, and that’s good. He has some characteristics that we miss last season, so I’m really happy with him and the other guys.\"",

      "It is nothing new to suggest that players who've headed to Manchester United for the past decade have generally looked less than the sum of their parts. It seems as if playing at Old Trafford sees individuals drop a level.",
      "A number of players have tried and failed to buck the trend, including some of the most expensive buys in the club's history. Manuel Ugarte is the fifth most expensive midfielder to sign for United and he arrived 12 months after being the subject of a transfer battle between Chelsea and PSG.",
      "The Uruguayan had impressed at Sporting Lisbon, playing under none other than Ruben Amorim. Several players have earned big moves after excelling with the Portuguese outfit.",
      "He failed to settle in Paris and he was signed by Erik ten Hag last summer, but a poor start for the Dutchman saw him sacked and so Ugarte was back working under Amorim. The man who had made him a player that some of Europe's elite were chasing.",
      "The new manager was confident their reunion would see Ugarte improve further. He said: \"All the Uruguayans I managed are incredible and that’s why I love them. Ugarte is a very talented boy and has a lot of room to grow. I am very happy to know that I have him back at Man United.\"",
      "Plenty in Manchester will have thought they had the ideal recipe to buck the trend of expensive arrivals falling well short of expectation. The current squad is full of players yet to deliver on their price tag and Gary Neville previously claimed that Old Trafford had become a \"graveyard\" for elite names.",
      "He said: \"I genuinely believe it's been a graveyard for every player that's joined that club in the last 10 years apart from Bruno. There's not one player joined that club that's improved apart from him. The rest of them, whether you go back to [Angel] Di Maria and [Bastian] Schweinsteiger, every player that's signed has gone backwards.\"",
      "But by Ugarte's own admission he is still not living up to standards with the hard-hitting defensive midfielder not delivering in an underperforming United side. He told El Observador: \"We haven't started the season very well. My level wasn't the best either, we have to be realistic and honest.\"",
      "Ugarte has found himself stuck on the bench throughout the year, coming on as a substitute for the first two games before he was left to watch on throughout the win over Burnley.",
      "The 24-year-old maintains that his relationship with Amorim remains a positive once despite him not being able to rediscover the form he showed at Sporting.",
      "He added: \"But I'm very confident, I have a very good relationship with the coach. I work well and I'm very excited and eager to earn a starting spot.”",
      "Ugarte is one of a number of signings made during the Ten Hag tenure who have failed to deliver on their fees, some already being pushed out the door. Antony headed to Real Betis, Rasmus Hojlund has gone out on loan. Now the latest set of recruits, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, will be determined not to feed Neville's narrative.",

      "The summer transfer window closed at 7pm on Monday for Premier League clubs, but an extra two hours were granted to the sides who sumbitted a deal sheet to complete late deals.",
      "United sources confirmed everything was on track to sign Lammens, despite the deadline passing. The club formally announced the transfer at 10pm and fans were relieved to see a goalkeeper come in.",
      "Royal Antwerp needed to cash in on Lammens due to their financial situation. United agreed a deal of £18.2million, plus add-ons, to land the goalkeeper and he signed a five-year contract.",
      "Lammens said: \"I am extremely proud to be joining Manchester United, it is a real dream come true. The past few years have been an amazing journey, it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special.",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my teammates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.”",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: “Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential; we are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.”",
      "The conversation about where Lammens fits into the goalkeeper pecking order began before his official arrival, as he has a huge opportunity to claim first-choice status at Old Trafford.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started the season as the first choice and made mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. Andre Onana was recalled to the starting team against Grimsby and he was at fault for their second goal.",
      "Ruben Amorim has a dilemma over which goalkeeper starts against Manchester City after the international break. Will he throw Lammens into the deep end? Will he persist with Bayindir? Could Onana return?",
      "All three goalkeeper options will be considered, but they're all imperfect. Lammens is unproven in the Premier League and starting him in the Manchester derby, one of the most watched and scrutinised games of the season, could potentially set him up to fail after only just signing for the club.",
      "If Lammens disappointed on his debut against City, he would face an uphill battle from the start of his United career, so Amorim might want to protect him with a long-term view in mind.",
      "On the other hand, the dream start for any new United signing is to perform well in the Manchester derby, and perhaps Lammens will be able to shrug off the pressure to sparkle at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim must decide whether Lammens will be able to cut it straight away. The bar is low for Lammens to impress considering how poor Bayindir and Onana have been and it will be difficult for him to be worse.",
      "Still, there is obviously an element of risk with Lammens and Amorim knows what to expect with Bayindir and Onana, which might be enough to tip the scales in favour of the pair.",
      "United have three senior goalkeepers - excluding Tom Heaton - battling for one place in the team, raising the possibility of either Onana or Bayindir being sold to a league whose window is still open (Saudi Arabia and Turkey).",
      "Amorim's selection for the opening games of the season suggests Bayindir will start against City if Lammens is overlooked. Onana has been demoted since returning from injury and seems to have lost Amorim's trust.",
      "If it's a choice between Bayindir and Lammens, the latter should get the nod for the derby.",

      "Speaking after the win over Burnley, Amorim explained his decision not to bring Sesko on earlier against Scott Parker's side.",
      "\"So he finished the [Grimsby] game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties,\" explained Amorim",
      "\"And today was that reason also, because (Joshua) Zirkzee is also a striker, he's an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a division four team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.",
      "\"With the problem with Mason Mount (injury), I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes. So everything was connected. The penalty, the game on Wednesday, and the number of minutes that I was thinking to put Ben today.\"",

      "The loanees cover every level from the Championship to the National League as well as moves to Scotland and Switzerland.",
      "But it's perhaps telling that three prospects who could have departed on loan remain in situ at United.",
      "Gabriele Biancheri was linked with a host of clubs in the closing days of the window but has remained at Old Trafford while Sekou Kone and Shea Lacey are two other talented teenagers remaining in the Under-21 ranks.",
      "The decision to keep the trio in house points to the three being key performers for Travis Binnion's side this season as well as supplementing the senior training group.",
      "All three have been involved with the first team previously and Ruben Amorim could well call upon them again as the campaign continues. United are unlikely to rotate their side too much given the light schedule with no European football and an early Carabao Cup exit, but the likes of Biancheri, Kone and Lacey could be the next cabs off the academy rank if United need to promote from within.",
      "Lacey has showed his capabilities this week with a superb goal for the Under-21s on Wednesday and an assist in the Premier League 2 derby win over Manchester City last weekend. The 18-year-old has had injury problems but is now fit and firing and his talent is clear to see. He will likely emerge as a key player at Under-21 level this term.",
      "The same can be said of Biancheri who was linked with a loan exit to Welsh pair Newport County and Cardiff City during the summer window. The talented forward has trained with the Wales squad and is also eligible for Canada, who have made a play for his services at international level ahead of next summer's World Cup in North America.",
      "For Kone, the prospect has opened up of him having a say in United's midfield of the future.",
      "He started for the Under-21s against Tamworth in the National League Cup last month and sustained a head injury which resulted in the game being abandoned. He has recovered but has a long way to go and has been on a steep learning curve since his arrival in England.",

      "Former Liverpool striker Stan Collymore has slammed Manchester United's transfer business this summer for missing out on key areas during their squad rebuild.",
      "The Reds spent around £215million on transfers this summer - signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. In terms of departures, around £68m was raised on the sales of Antony and Alejandro Garnacho while a loan fee was received for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "United's new signings have got off to a mixed start under Ruben Amorim. Cunha and Mbeumo have impressed at times, but Sesko has yet to score after four games for the Reds, although he is yet to start in the Premier League for Amorim's team in the early days of 2025/26.",
      "One transfer decision which raised eyebrows this summer was not going for former PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who ended up joining rivals Manchester City.",
      "And Collymore has questioned United's summer business - raising doubts over Lammens and why certain areas were not addressed in Amorim's squad.",
      "“I’m surprised that Man United didn’t throw their hat in the ring for Donnarumma,\" he told Caughtoffside. \"A winner, an excellent shot stopper, a good marshaller of a defence. In terms of Lammens, who knows?",
      "\"With goalkeepers that haven’t been tested at elite level – and the Belgian league isn’t elite level – it is that it’s a toss of a coin. In terms of the Emi Martinez scenario… do I think he would have been a good goalkeeper for them? Yes, I do, I also think Donnarumma would have been a very good goalkeeper for Man United, considering this type of goalkeeper that they’ve brought in.",
      "“However, there’s nothing that suggested that I was wrong in this column several weeks ago by saying just because they’ve brought in Cunha and Mbeumo and Sesko, that’s all their problems solved. There is a defensive problem there.",
      "\"There is a creative problem there. The three attacking players… You buy at the end of the project of buying defenders, a goalkeeper and a midfielder, not putting the cart before the horse.",
      "“I’m sure Manchester United will be entertaining. But I think the notion that the defence and a rookie goalkeeper is going to perform better than last season is far from guaranteed.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "During his stay at Old Trafford, Garnacho quickly became a regular in the first-team. However, Ruben Amorim's arrival last season was the start of the downfall with a number of incidents resulting in him being placed in the 'bomb squad' at United this summer.",
      "His dream move to Chelsea was confirmed towards the end of the summer window and, with him having no spot in the Argentina squad for this month's international break, the 21-year-old has been working at the Blues' training ground ahead of the return of domestic football.",
      "On Wednesday, Garnacho's shirt number in London was revealed and it was given a nod to his first number at United. The forward wore the No.49 for his first season in the first-team, before he became holder of the No.17.",

      "Michael Owen has believes Manchester United will continue to back Ruben Amorim, despite a suggestion from Phil Jones that some players \"don't like him.\"",
      "Amorim has struggled to make his mark at Old Trafford since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November, ending his first season without a trophy and a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League. However, the board has shown faith in the 40-year-old by investing heavily in the squad this summer.",
      "Amorim has been given free rein to spend over £200million to bolster his team, bringing in attacking trio Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, and has also had a full pre-season to get his squad ready for the new Premier League campaign. Former United striker Owen has pointed out that these are clear signs of the club's commitment to him.",
      "Speaking to A Bola, 45-year-old Owen said: \"I think Manchester United is a patient club. Of course, they can't go year after year without doing things well. Man United gave Ruben Amorim almost a year, and it was a very poor year in the Premier League.",
      "\"They've never finished so low in the table. Many clubs would say that's not enough, that they need a new manager. But Manchester United stuck with him, and I think it's a good decision.",
      "\"They spent a lot of money, which shows they have confidence in him. You hear all kinds of rumours, but not about the club wanting to change. They're showing loyalty, that they believe in the manager. I believe that, in the short term, Ruben Amorim still has the club's trust.\"",
      "Having secured a loss, a draw and a victory against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley respectively in their opening three Premier League games, United supporters might question whether Amorim truly represents the correct choice for the position. Additionally, a shock Carabao Cup elimination at the hands of League Two outfit Grimsby Town last month heaped additional scrutiny upon the Portuguese manager.",
      "Despite retiring before Amorim had replaced Ten Hag, Jones has suggested a level of discord within the squad under his watch. Speaking to Ladbrokes, the defender, who made 229 appearances for United from 2011 to 2023, said: \"Do I think there were players at United who didn't like him?",
      "\"To be honest, that's probably a ridiculous question because I'd say there are people in the United team now who don't like the manager. But there are probably players at Man City who feel the same way about [Pep] Guardiola; they can't stand him.",
      "\"There are people like that in every team; these are big groups of players and different personalities, and all of them are competitive, and think they should be playing more than they are. That will never, ever change.",
      "\"Even when a manager is flying, there will always be someone going, 'Well, he's not playing me, so he's not good.' Trust me, I've been there myself. I've been a young kid moaning about training being rubbish. But in reality, it's not rubbish; you're just hurt and you don't know how to deal with it.\"",
      "Amorim now has a reprieve during the international break ahead of United's next Premier League match - a short trip to Guardiola's City for the season's first Manchester derby on Sunday, September 14.",

      "A report has emerged claiming Manchester United could be set for further financial windfall to line the coffers following Antony's summer transfer switch to Real Betis.",
      "After months of speculation, the Brazilian left United on transfer deadline day to complete a permanent move to the La Liga outfit.",
      "Antony spent the second half of last season on loan with Betis and had been heavily linked with a return to the Spanish club on a permanent basis this summer.",
      "After a summer full of twists and turns as to what may happen regarding his future, the winger eventually completed a permanent move to Betis bringing an end to a disappointing United tenure.",
      "The deal in total is worth €25million (£21.6million) with a €22million (£19m) initial fee plus a further €3million (£2.6m) in add-ons. United also included a 50% sell-on clause in the deal which United receive would receive if Betis made any profit from the deal for Antony.",
      "A report from Spain has provided some insight into the deal which saw Antony leave United to join Betis. It has been reported by ABC Sevilla, that Betis will pay €4.5million per year to United over the length of the four-year contract that Antony has signed.",
      "The article goes on to claim that United could receive more money from Betis thanks to a clause included in the deal. Betis will apparently have to pay an additional €500,000 (£434,000) to United if they win a major trophy or qualify for the Champions League in any of the seasons in which Antony is under contract.",
      "Therefore, there is the potential for United to receive an additional €2million (£1.7million) if this clause is met every year. It would then take the total transfer fee up to €27million (£23.4million) for the total fee for the transfer, if the report turns out to be correct.",
      "United released a statement confirming Antony's departure on deadline day, which said: \"Manchester United and Real Betis have reached an agreement for the permanent transfer of Antony, subject to international clearance and registration. The Brazil international has rejoined the club where he spent the second part of last season on a loan basis, scoring nine times in 26 games across all competitions.",
      "\"He helped the Seville-based outfit reach the UEFA Conference League final, supplying four goals and three assists, although Chelsea lifted the trophy in Wroclaw. Antony signed for United from Ajax in the summer of 2022 and made a total of 96 appearances for the club, scoring 12 goals.",
      "\"He performed well in the Carabao Cup final victory over Newcastle United that landed a trophy for Erik ten Hag's team and was also part of the squad that lifted the Emirates FA Cup in the following season, beating Manchester City 2-1 at Wembley in the final.",
      "\"The South American's final outing for the Reds came in January of this year, when he appeared as a substitute during a Premier League defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford. Everybody at the club would like to wish Antony the very best of luck for the future.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's side were active in the transfer market until the last minute with Lammens arriving on deadline day. Up until the closure of the window, the possibility of a midfielder coming in remained a realistic opportunity.",
      "Despite the business that was completed, United have taken their time to switch on in the 2025/26 season. After losing to Arsenal on the opening day, the Reds drew to Fulham and narrowly beat Burnley.",
      "Mbeumo is the only one of the three new attackers to get on the scoresheet for United with Cunha suffering an injury last week and Sesko yet to start in the Premier League. Yet with Rasmus Hojlund returning to Italy on loan with Napoli, there is scope for a new centre-forward to compete with Sesko.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho, promptly followed by Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo captured the imaginations of Manchester United supporters when they posed on the advertising hoardings after the former scored against West Ham United.",

      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson's exit, United had lost their way when it came to trusting youth over experience. Ageing player signings had become the norm in a desperate attempt to move the club back onto its pedestal.",
      "More often than not, the household names flopped and United were left in a bigger hole than they originally found themselves in. And yet, as this exciting young trio beamed for the cameras at Old Trafford, there was a renewed optimism that perhaps United were returning to a side built for the future.",
      "Fast forward a year and a half and the manager who gave the trio their breaks at United has been gone for nearly 12 months, the goalscorer has left permanently, another is all but gone for good and the sole survivor requested his own departure last week. How things change...",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "This iconic image is now tinged with sadness. Garnacho's exit from Old Trafford was on the walls from December but few could have predicted how far it capitulated in the final few months.",
      "Hojlund looked like he could kick on after his debut season but a horror second year put paid to that. All that remains from the image is Mainoo and surely the alarm bells are starting to ring for him now.",
      "Unlike his former teammates, Mainoo is a boyhood United fan and while he requested to leave OId Trafford towards the end of the window, he was only looking for a loan. Proof, if needed, that he still harbours hopes of making it at United.",
      "But if he is to do that, something drastic needs to change somewhere. The new United being built by Ruben Amorim is not one for sentimentality.",
      "Once a player is seen as not being the right fit anymore, they are out the door. Nobody could have envisaged Marcus Rashford leaving the club but even he is out now.",
      "United were keen not to let Mainoo go last week, perhaps due to the lack of competition it would have left for Bruno Fernandes. However, it is almost certain that the midfield will be the next area to receive an overhaul and when it does, it is unclear if the Stockport-born star will have a place in this new reality.",
      "If Mainoo was to look at that image during the international break, perhaps it would serve as a warning to him that he must either dig deep or face the consequences, like those he shared the hoarding with. Everyone of a United persuasion wants to see the 20-year-old succeed, even Amorim has admitted that, but that desire may not be enough to keep him around.",

      "As the dust begins to settle following the summer transfer window, Manchester United are now taking stock of the business that has been done and what is to come.",
      "In truth, it was a busier summer than many of us were expecting from the Reds, particularly after United lost the Europa League final. The attack has had a complete makeover while there have been plenty of outgoings which, for a time, did not look likely.",
      "But with us firmly in the midst of the first international break of the campaign, this is a great opportunity to take stock on the summer that was and the priorities we would have for the next few weeks. Here, MEN Sport has a go at managing United.",
      "The first port of call for Ruben Amorim will surely be to collar Kobbie Mainoo for a chat at Carrington. His exclusion from the England squad allows Amorim the opportunity to have a frank and open conversation with the 20-year-old.",
      "It was disappointing but not altogether surprising that Mainoo requested a loan move away from United after being cast aside by Amorim for much of the campaign so far. That being said, the Portuguese head coach wants the midfielder to remain in the building and in his plans so a meeting to express that would be a good place to start.",
      "If Mainoo was so eager to leave Old Trafford, he would have handed in a transfer request rather than a loan equivalent. That suggests there should be no concerns surrounding the midfielder's attitude moving forward and there is still a chance that he can prove to be a real asset at Amorim's United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Another player who asked to leave but is facing a much more uncertain future is Tyrell Malacia. He is the last remaining member of the so-called 'bomb squad' to be without a new club and he faces a long wait until January to move on.",
      "It is in both United and Malacia's interests to organise a transfer for him sooner rather than later. A move to Turkey or Saudi Arabia is therefore the only option left.",
      "No interest has materialised from clubs in either country to date but that could all change. Even if it is just a loan until January, at least the 26-year-old would be getting games under his belt.",
      "Perhaps of more urgency is figuring out what to do in the goalkeeper department. United have four senior goalkeepers in their ranks and ultimately that is one too many.",
      "Senne Lammens looks highly unlikely to leave on loan - if that was the plan we would have heard by now. Tom Heaton has only just signed a new deal so that leaves just one of two men who need to exit.",
      "You would imagine that finding a suitor for Altay Bayindir would be easier considering his Turkish roots. However, Andre Onana's exit could be given the green light should a significant sum come in - most likely from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Either way, someone has to go.",
      "Last up, United need to start making a plan for the January transfer window now which they will be able to implement straightaway. The mid-season market is notoriously difficult to negotiate so planning is everything.",
      "It goes without saying that, as things stand, midfield would be the priority. Whether United have the funds to sign a big name like Carlos Baleba or Adam Wharton midway through the season remains to be seen.",
      "But either way, the desire will surely be there to add at least one central midfielder to tide the club on to next summer. Of course, this is all presuming that other areas of the squad do not need sorting come January.",

      "Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni reckons Emi Martinez has swiftly regrouped following a chaotic deadline day that saw him stay put at Aston Villa rather than securing a switch to Manchester United.",
      "Martinez had been receptive to departing Villa throughout the summer and was enthusiastic about a move to Old Trafford after five campaigns at the club.",
      "Despite penning fresh terms just last August, Villa were prepared to allow his departure if the correct bid materialised during the transfer window.",
      "United lodged a loan bid for Martinez earlier in the summer, but Villa turned it down. No formal approach arrived from United thereafter, including on deadline day.",
      "Instead, United chose to recruit Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, leaving Martinez as Villa's number one as he departed to link up with Argentina for the September internationals.",
      "Prior to their clash against Venezuela, Scaloni was quizzed about Martínez's frame of mind, reports Birmingham Live.",
      "\"Emi is fine,\" Scaloni said in his press conference. \"In the end, his transfer didn't happen, but yesterday (Tuesday) was his birthday and I saw him happy.",
      "\"Of course, he must have been excited about the idea of playing for Manchester United, as people have said, but he's a positive kid. He's already focused on us, and when he returns to his club, he'll be focused on them. I saw him well.\"",
      "When questioned if he was worried Martínez might lose his starting berth at Villa, Scaloni responded: \"I'm interested in him playing, but we're not going to get ahead of ourselves.",
      "\"I understand that, if he stays, everything will continue as normal. We'll see what happens. It's not my decision.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has shown Ruben Amorim that he is not resting on his laurels this week despite not being called up for the England squad.",
      "Mainoo's future at United appears to be in serious jeopardy at present after he asked to leave the club on loan last week. The Reds' response to this request was one of defiance with Amorim eager to keep hold of the youngster.",
      "As the window slammed shut on Monday, it was clear the 20-year-old would not be departing Old Trafford and he remains a United player until January at least. Mainoo's urge to depart the north west stemmed from his lack of playing time so far this season.",
      "Despite United not proving themselves to be world beaters so far this season, Mainoo has struggled for minutes. He has also seen his close friend Alejandro Garnacho leave which may have also led him to question his role in the United set-up.",
      "While some players may prove to be a handful after missing out on an exit at the end of the window, Mainoo appears to be keen to get his head down and earn his place in the starting XI. Sharing a post from a training regime at Hale Country Club, Mainoo seems keen to keep his fitness levels high ahead of the Premier League's return.",
      "After missing out on a call-up to the England squad, Mainoo will be on a reduced schedule this week before hitting the ground running next week before the Manchester derby. Whether this alone will earn the midfielder a start against Manchester City remains to be seen.",
      "Currently, he is in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes for a starting place which perhaps indicates why he has not been getting the minutes he desires as of yet. The next four months will show whether Mainoo will repeat his brutal decision to request an exit again or not.",

      "Garnacho's time at United came to an end at the weekend when he completed a £40m move to Stamford Bridge. The Argentine was bought for a nominal fee from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and joined the academy structure at Carrington.",
      "Within two years he had made a name for himself and was drafted into the first-team, playing alongside one of his childhood idols Cristiano Ronaldo. However, after Erik ten Hag was sacked in October 2024, his time at United hurdled towards an end.",
      "In Ruben Amorim's new system, Garnacho failed to adapt and this led to him becoming a substitute. He was dropped for the Manchester derby in December alongside Marcus Rashford.",
      "After that he was ordered to buy a meal for all his teammates after storming off the field following his substitution. However, Amorim cut ties with the winger at the end of the season when he posted a petulant image of himself celebrating in the FA Cup final against Manchester City when he was dropped for the Europa League finale in Bilbao.",
      "He would then bemoan his lack of playing time in the final during a post-match interview. The opinion of United fans towards Garnacho soured further when, in June, he posted a picture of himself on holiday in Rashford's shirt from his stint at Aston Villa.",
      "When he returned from his holiday, Garnacho joined the so-called 'bomb squad' requesting his exit from Old Trafford which was granted at the very end of the window. Despite how his time at the club ended, the 21-year-old posted an emotional goodbye to the United fans on social media.",
      "As his new chapter begins in the capital, he has given a nod back to United by choosing the No.49 as his new shirt number. This number belonged to Garnacho before he was given the No.17 upgrade.",
      "At the time, it was seen as a slight against Garnacho that he was not given the No.7 shirt. Instead, that accolade was handed to new arrival Mason Mount.",
      "Garnacho may make a near instant return to Old Trafford after the international break when the Reds host the Blues on Saturday, September 20.",

      "United made this a priority as they were toothless in attack last season and Semenyo was mentioned as a potential alternative before they settled on Mbeumo and Cunha as their preferred No.10 targets.",
      "25-year-old Semenyo enjoyed a breakout season for Bournemouth in 2024/25, grabbing eleven goals and five assists in the Premier League.",

      "Castles has also suggested that issues relating to the fee and salary for Semenyo were behind Man Utd’s failure to land the talented attacker.",
      "“Tottenham were also interested in signing the player, and Bournemouth used that to insist on a higher transfer fee and, after the Cunha deal, used that as a precedent on what they expected the transfer fee to at least meet.",
      "“And then, I’m told, Semenyo discovered that the salary he had agreed with Man Utd was going to be less than 70 per cent of what they were prepared to pay Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "“Bournemouth strategically used that to convince the player to sign a new contract until 2030, with the idea that he will spend at least one more season at Bournemouth before moving on to another club.",
      "“Guidance from Man Utd is that they saw Semenyo as an alternative to either Cunha or Mbeumo, but Bournemouth believe that they were prepared to do all three of those deals.”",

      "There is not so much a hole in Amorim’s engine room as an asteroid-sized crater. One that could ultimately cost Amorim his job if European qualification really is a non-negotiable target this season.",
      "If United and Amorim fall short, then the manager’s dogmatic belief in his one and only system looks likely to be the primary reason. And without a deep-lying midfielder who can destroy and dictate, Amorim is almost being set up to fail.",
      "That they were so keen on Carlos Baleba suggests there are important people at United who haven’t missed the bleeding obvious. Brighton’s valuation made United cower so far into submission that they appeared scared to consider the possibility that Baleba might not be the only No.6 on earth.",
      "Already, with the window still shaking from being SLAMMED SHUT, there is talk of renewed interest in Baleba and other midfielders next summer. Have United missed their best opportunity to land Baleba? If he shows the form he’s widely thought to be capable of this season, Brighton will be looking for another record fee, by which time the £100million they wanted last month will seem cheap. And United might not have the free run they could have enjoyed this summer.",
      "Regardless, Amorim cannot afford to think so far ahead. Right now, he appears to be living game-to-game, even if the United hierarchy are said to have no plans – yet – to rip up their latest plan. Though if he goes, it is just as likely that it won’t be the club’s decision.",
      "With United’s forward line completely and expensively remodelled and a goalkeeper who isn’t Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir, Amorim’s overwhelming priority now is to make do and mend his midfield hole.",
      "The chasm lies next to Bruno Fernandes. The captain’s suitability to a central midfield role is a debate for another time, but his more permanent shift into a deeper position makes it more imperative that any partner has legs.",
      "Casemiro had legs for days; pins among the best in Europe. But those days have passed.",
      "Amorim, probably correctly, says Kobbie Mainoo is an alternative to Fernandes, not a foil.",
      "Which leaves one possible option: Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ugarte was bought last summer for this exact job. United sacrificed Scott McTominay to add some Uruguayan bite into Erik ten Hag’s midfield. A year on, Ten Hag has been sacked twice; McTominay is the King of Naples; and Ugarte looks further than ever from filling his brief.",
      "We should make allowances for any midfielder coming into the hustle and bustle of the Premier League from Ligue 1 and, prior to that, the Portuguese league. Ugarte was 23 when United paid £42million up front to pluck him from PSG – perhaps their gratitude ought to have raised our suspicions – and there is a long list of stars who took time to adjust before ultimately thriving in Our League.",
      "If United did not see their midfield as a priority this summer, increased expectations of Ugarte must have prompted that judgement. Which makes his start to the season all the more concerning.",
      "Overlooked for Casemiro, Ugarte came off the bench midway through the second halves of the defeat to Arsenal and draw at Fulham. Not coincidentally just as whatever control United had gained in either game began to slip.",
      "He started in the Carabao Cup. Ugarte certainly wasn’t alone in stinking out Grimsby but he was one of three hooked at half-time while Amorim’s patience dangled by a thinning thread. Struggling to keep up with the pace in your first season in the Premier League is understandable. Being miles off it against League Two opposition is infinitely more damning.",
      "So poor were those 91 combined minutes that hopes for Ugarte being the answer to Amorim’s problems are slimmer than ever. Which is even more peculiar when you consider that no United player should be more familiar with the manager’s expectations.",
      "Ugarte thrived under Amorim as a Sporting player. His form through two seasons – 61 starts in 85 appearances – earned the midfielder his £50million move to PSG. When Amorim took over from Ten Hag, Ugarte was expected to gain more than most.",
      "Instead, Ugarte is going under. Amorim hinted in pre-season at Ugarte’s struggles with confidence and ‘off the pitch’ matters that may be hampering his efforts to establish himself in United’s midfield. The manager wasn’t telling anyone what we had not already assumed from the sight of opponents running off the back of Ugarte and some questionable decision making on the ball.",
      "In many ways, Ugarte’s struggle is a symbol of the wider sentiment around United. The feeling most prominent in the manager’s mind, if not resignation, is hope rather than expectation. But if Ugarte is ever to emerge from whatever slump he has fallen in to, it has to happen now.",
      "Manchester United’s problems could all have been solved by simply signing England’s two best players a couple of years ago. Easy game in hindsight.",
      "Marc Guehi is reportedly angry that his move to Liverpool fell through at the final hurdle but an upcoming payday plus his previous actions make it hard to have too ...",
      "Liverpool fans continue the net spend chat while wondering aloud if they should have signed Marc Guehi rather than Alexander Isak.",
      "Man Utd appear to have three second-choice keepers and no first-choice, while Liverpool and Spurs have gambled on their first-choice defence staying fit.",
      "If it was Isak’s decision to strike or not, it does not matter for while he takes a public battering, football’s biggest influencers counts their millions.",
      "To make everything at Man City work under Pep Guardiola, Ederson was the most important signing the club made."

      "Florian Wirtz as PFA Player of the Year? Sunderland going down? Idiots.",
      "It remains a cause of great frustration for us soothsayers that the transfer window remains open after the start of the season and believe it shutting on Monday merits another bash at those predictions.",
      "",
      "Liverpool winning three games from three having played well for roughly 30 minutes across those victories over their greatest title challengers Arsenal, a raging Newcastle and a Bournemouth side that’s won both games besides without conceding a goal puts them way out in front as title favourites, if they weren’t already, as they will play well at some point, with the small matter of a new £130m striker to aid them in that quest.",
      "",
      "Wouldn’t it be neat if the top four after three games was the top four at the end of the season, and d’you know what? We think it just might be. Chelsea have had favourable fixtures but have added a bit of The Arsenal to their armoury, while The Arsenal arguably now have too much of The Arsenal for even Eberechi Eze to balance out, so they’re coming third.",

Tottenham meanwhile have hired a very good manager and had a perfectly serviceable transfer window, in the end.",
      "",
      "We’re far from convinced that the signing of striker Tolu Arokodare from Genk will move the needle enough for pointless Wolves, who also kept hold of Jorgen Strand Larsen, but we can’t see much of a creative spark anywhere. West Ham confused us greatly with that win over Nottingham Forest and will probably have enough anyway. Burnley and Leeds to join Wolves.",
      "",
      "Kudos to Joe Williams for picking Sunderland as the pleasant surprise before they picked up as many wins (2) in their first three Premier League games as Southampton managed in the whole of last season.",
      "And with their newfound status as a Premier League stalwart they signed Manchester United-linked Brian Brobbey and former Chelsea winger Bertrand Traore from Ajax on deadline day, while Arsenal-linked Lutsharel Geertruida joined on loan from RB Leipzig. That’s big boy sh*t, yeah.",
      "",
      "Nick Wolte… nah. That would be f***ing brilliant though, wouldn’t it? Him and Yoane Wissa do have a very good chance of beating the tally of the strikers they’ve replaced (23: Alexander Isak – 23; Callum Wilson – 0) but we’re not convinced either will a) play enough to win it or b) be prolific enough get anywhere close to matching Erling Haaland, who will presumably bumble his way to 30-odd to come out on top after three in his first three games.",
      "Isak arguably had a better chance of winning it by staying at Newcastle, as he’s set to share the goalscoring load with Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike after his excellent start to the season. Regretting it already, we imagine.",

      "Man Utd “could live to regret” their decision to sign Senne Lammens over Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, according to ESPN journalist Mark Ogden.",
      "The Red Devils mainly strengthened their attack in the summer transfer window with around £200m spent on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "They did bring in a new goalkeeper on deadline day with Lammens signing from Royal Antwerp for a fee of £18.2m after deciding to go for the Belgian rather than Martinez.",

      "READ: Why the five post-Fergie Man Utd managers before Amorim were sacked",
      "Ogden told ESPN: “They were playing a strange game with the goalkeepers. It looked like Emi Martinez was on his way to Man United, but they preferred Lammens.",
      "“I’m kind of surprised by that because, for me, Martinez is what they need right now. They need someone with a strength of character, personality, and world-class ability to sort out the defence and add confidence.",
      "“They believe that Lammens is the better bet, and that the cost of getting Martinez on a short-term loan was too high in terms of wages, so they went with Lammens. I think they could live to regret that.”",

      "“I remember being a kid, Manchester United winning the Champions League and winning the league, and also [I want] to help the team get to a level that you can compete for a title again and to play Champions League again. That’s also one of my biggest points, that I want to grow with the team and go up to the heights that used to be Manchester United.",

      "Phil Jones has called for Manchester United players who “don’t like” Ruben Amorim to “pull yourself out of your a***”, but the Red Devils boss is clearly “the problem” in Kobbie Mainoo’s case.",
      "“It’s our responsibility, we’re the ones on the pitch. Simple as that,” Diogo Dalot said when asked about speculation over Ruben Amorim’s future at Manchester United after the embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "It’s the only thing footballers say if they want to continue to play football under a manager at risk of the sack. What’s the alternative? Blast the philosophy and tactics? Under-fire managers will continue to have the full public support and backing of the players until the time comes when they’re no longer the manager. But as Phil Jones says, there are inevitably United players who “don’t like” Amorim.",
      "“Do I think there were players at United who didn’t like him? To be honest, that’s probably a ridiculous question because I’d say there are people in the United team now who don’t like the manager,” Jones told Ladbrokes.",
      "As there will be at Manchester City under Pep Guardiola and Liverpool under Arne Slot – we can’t imagine Federico Chiesa’s too enamoured with the Reds boss right now, for example.",
      "“Trust me, I’ve been there myself,” Jones continued. “I’ve been a young kid moaning about training being rubbish. But in reality, it’s not rubbish; you’re just hurt and you don’t know how to deal with it.",
      "“You have to realise what’s going on, pull yourself out of your a*** and get back to where you need to get back to. Nine times out of ten, that’s what the problem is.",
      "“That comes with experience, though. The more mature I got, the more games I played and the more managers I had, the more of an understanding I had about it all.",
      "“You know, it wasn’t the manager who was the problem, it was me. When I think of some players now, more often than not, they find it very easy to just pass the blame onto the manager.”",
      "And those sidelined players aren’t daft. Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee know full well that the only effect of breaking ranks to have a go at the manager will for them to be jettisoned from the first team and made to train away from the squad. What’s the use in picking up a spade when Amorim is doing such a stand-up job of digging his own Manchester United grave?",
      "It will be particularly difficult for Mainoo to accept that he’s “the problem” and not Amorim. He’s gone from being a Manchester United and England pin-up when Amorim arrived to a benchwarmer denied a loan exit in search of game time in a World Cup year.",
      "The combination of Amorim not playing him thanks to a system that doesn’t suit Mainoo, along with the majority of his teammates, and him (or maybe the club) refusing to let him leave must be incredibly frustrating.",
      "Amorim has insisted that Mainoo must “fight for his place”, but the 20-year-old will view that fight with captain and talisman Bruno Fernandes as one he can’t win.",
      "We can’t imagine Mainoo is the sort of footballer who will sulk and down tools. There are videos on social media of him doing extra training sessions this week having not been selected by Thomas Tuchel for England duty. We suspect he will continue to fight that losing battle.",
      "But upon hearing Jones’ call for United players to “pull yourself out of your a***”, Mainoo may be wondering what the point is, because in his case – that one in ten instance Jones referred to – he’s not “the problem”, Ruben Amorim is.",
      "Amorim may well look at the fate that’s befallen five of his six Manchester United predecessors this summer and think twice about resigning.",

      "After a quite extraordinary week at the end of a depressing summer for former Manchester United managers, while we’re sure Ruben Amorim continues to picture his calm and stress free life away from Old Trafford, he may now be wondering if – for the sake of his managerial career – he has to make this work.",
      "As he rocked from side to side on the bench in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town he looked like a man who would rather be anywhere else, and the head shakes and frustration displayed against Burnley suggest this will be an international break of introspection for the United boss despite the breathing space that last-gasp victory has granted him.",
      "After he reportedly had to be talked down from the ledge in January following a 3-1 home defeat to Brighton, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, there is once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "Reports suggest Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS remain as staunchly wedded to their underperforming manager as Amorim is to his failing philosophy. It feels as though Amorim is closer to walking than being sacked, but we’re not convinced the nuance of his exit from Old Trafford will save him from a fate that has befallen five of his six predecessors.",
      "All of Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, Erik ten Hag and Ruud van Nistelrooy are currently without clubs having been employed either last season, this season or both before being sacked this summer.",
      "The most notable and brutal of those dismissals was Ten Hag’s from Bayer Leverkusen. The Dutchman has hit out at his ‘unprecedented’ sacking just two games into the Bundesliga season, while reports in Germany claim that the ill feeling towards Ten Hag at the club meant that sporting director Simon Rolfes had, if anything, ‘waited too long’ to get rid of him.",
      "In a very familiar tale for United fans, Ten Hag ‘failed to convey ideas’ and ‘no-one knew what to do’, leading long-serving members of staff to mock him through open debates as to whether he was the worst manager in the club’s history.",
      "Mourinho was shown the Fenerbahce door after they failed to get through the Champions League play-offs, though it’s claimed his sacking had been coming thanks to his uninspiring football and his increasingly public clashes with the club hierarchy over transfers.",
      "Solskjaer steered Besiktas to fourth last season having taken charge in January but was dismissed after defeat to Swiss side Lausanne in the Conference League play-offs on Thursday meant the club would not be playing European football this season.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough after the club failed to reach the Championship play-offs for the second consecutive season, with four wins from four games to start the new campaign under Rob Edwards making that look like a very good call. And Van Nistelrooy was sent packing by Leicester after winning just four of 25 Premier League games last term having taken the reins after his interim stint at United",
      "It offers Amorim an incredibly grim view of what his post-United career might be like and Ralf Rangnick being the only one out of the last six to have retained his job, as Austria head coach, suggests the Portuguese boss, praised for his honest appraisal of the basket case he’s in charge of, should go one step further and declare the need for “open-heart surgery”, as Rangnick famously insisted was a requirement to fix a football club which quite clearly remains broken.",

      "The boost of an all-new forward line signed during the transfer window has been offset by the failure to fix an enduring midfield problem felt by at least two managers before him, while a goalkeeper has been signed who will likely add to his No.1 conundrum rather than solve it, in the short-term at least.",
      "He reached a United nadir in defeat to League Two Grimsby Town and any significant increase on his 26 per cent Premier League win percentage feels unlikely despite him having a pre-season to bed in his ideas and a philosophy he remains staunchly wedded to despite it showing no signs of coming good.",

      "",
      "As crimes go, not being the most successful manager in Premier League history is barely worth a slap on the wrists. And in hindsight, even given Sir Alex Ferguson’s standing as Mr Manchester United by the summer of 2013, a football club allowing a sitting manager to select their replacement is a madness, especially when Fergie’s selection criteria appeared to be ‘a guy I like’, ‘quite old’ and ‘Scottish’.",
      "The passage of time and the shortcomings of those who have come after him have worked in Moyes’ favour. Feelings at the time that he wasn’t given a fair shot with Marouane Fellaini his sole summer signing to aid an ageing squad have only grown since since to a point where most feel sympathy for Moyes at taking a job he couldn’t turn down but was doomed to fail in.",
      "Unai Emery similarly endured the difficulties of replacing a legacy Premier League manager at Arsenal, while Arne Slot’s success at Liverpool is in large part down to the rebuilding work already done by honorary scouser Jurgen Klopp, who left him with a squad ready to win the title rather than a title-winning squad past the peak of its powers.",

      "United failed to score in 23 of the Dutchman’s 103 games in charge and drew 19 of their 76 in the Premier League, with the majority of Van Gaal-based entertainment emanating from the touchline or in press conferences.",
      "Responding to Scholes’ criticism, which by no means limited to the above, Van Gaal questioned whether his comments were for “the benefit of the club, or the benefit of himself?” He never got the United punditry cabal onside and the fans echoed their sentiments of apathy over the style of football, which led to third and fifth-placed finishes in the Premier League, with the FA Cup gong at the end of his second season not enough to save Van Gaal from a tide that had turned through weeks and months of stale football.",

      "A public flirtation with PSG on the back of consistent claims by Mourinho that he was not being backed in the transfer market, including days after buying Fred for £50m, led to a feeling that by the end (let’s face it, probably throughout) he felt he was bigger than the club.",

Now, while we by no means sign up to this mood-killing obsession with philosophy and strict guidelines, and would like nothing more than an unshackled team being successful, the reality of modern day football is that success can’t be powered by vibes.",
      "Solskjaer arrived armed with little more than his legendary status as a footballer at Old Trafford and it never felt as though he ever got past the point of being no more than a guy too old to be in the XIs he was selecting, with the respect he earned from his players based on him scoring a goal in 1999 rather than from any instruction on the training pitch or from the sidelines.",

Now, we are seeing that same technical ability being demanded across the world but not just of the smaller players.",
      "If in the past it was accepted that for what you lose in technical ability, tall players make up for it with their aerial supremacy; now we have players like Isak who can challenge in the air but also be great with the ball on the deck. Erling Haaland is another example and perhaps one of the most representative given that he plays for the man who popularised the short passing game.",
      "The role of a striker has also changed significantly. If in the past they were the main focal point of attack, they are now there to contribute and free up space for others as much as they are to score.

The Blues are working to find a solution but you can’t blame Sterling for sitting tight until he’s paid what he is contractually owed.",

Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money, but we remain to see if that remains the case through the deal he recently penned to stay for two more seasons.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. United have tried to shift his salary off their books but with a year to go, so far, there have been no takers. Sounds like a job for the Saudi lads.",

      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. The new deal earned the striker a £2.6million-a-year pay rise and though £41million over two years might terrify the weirdos who think a footballer is finished at 30, it would have cost a sh*te sight more to replace him.",

It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "The transfer window is closed, but we’re not quite ready to give up on transfer features just yet. Not when the alternative is international break fixtures and having to think about how on earth we go about doing an England Ladder in a world where Ruben Loftus-Cheek is back in the mix.",
      "So we will continue milking the window for all its worth until the very last drop.",
      "Here we take a look at a few of the more obvious holes and gaps and in some cases meteorite-contact craters that were left unfilled in Premier League squads when the window slammed so dramatically shut and once again, despite it having been around for so very long, caught a lot of teams apparently by surprise.",
      "",
      "It’s a tricky balancing act, when you think about it, getting the right mix of goalkeepers in your squad.",
      "You obviously want good goalkeepers and one excellent one, ideally. Your second-choice needs to be someone who can come into the team without prompting mass panic. And then there’s the third-choice, who should in a perfect world be a cheerful veteran playing out his final days in the professional game and living his very best life.",
      "The key, really, lies in getting the right gap between your first and second-choice keepers. The second-choice keeper needs to be good enough to keep the first-choice honest, but without creating unnecessary confusion. Proper competition for places is good, generally, but keeper is a position where you really want a bit of reliability and certainty.",
      "Liverpool, of course, had got it perfect in recent years with the elite world-class number one in Alisson, and then a very good but clearly not quite as good back-up in Caoimhin Kelleher. And even Liverpool couldn’t sustain it forever as Kelleher’s understandable desire to be first-choice somewhere grew undeniable.",
      "Manchester United do not have it, and on deadline day they made it even more confusing. In Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and now Senne Lammens, United have three goalkeepers who will all believe they could or should be first choice. Even the bit they had right – cheerful veteran third-choice keeper – is blown apart because Tom Heaton is now fourth-choice. What a mess.",
      "United did not need to create further confusion in a vital position that has already cost them this season and did so frequently last season.",
      "Had they bought a Donnarumma or a Martinez, it could still have all gone wrong but there would at least have been clarity about who the first-choice keeper was.",
      "Lammens is highly-rated and may in time be the long-term solution. But expecting that to happen quickly is wing-and-a-prayer stuff. Not for the first time in recent years, the United brains trust has afforded itself the luxury of a transfer with an eye on the future when this is a club and team that needs real-time solutions right now.",
      "It’s nice to set yourself up to be judged on the future rather than the present, because the future never comes. But United are drowning in waters they’ve just needlessly muddied.",
      "We really do think that United and City would both benefit from a swap deal.",
      "",
      "Liverpool enjoyed one of the most outrageous transfer windows ever and it really does seem churlish to nitpick. But there remains a non-zero chance that devoting so much energy to the cherry-on-top signing of Alexander Isak to bolster an already absurdly overpowered Premier League champion attack while leaving a deal for Marc Guehi until the very last minute might appear an error in priorities.",
      "Liverpool have left themselves riskily short at the back, even if Ibrahima Konate was currently operating at the top of his game. Which he is not. Guehi was not just a squad option; he would have instantly improved Liverpool’s first XI.",
      "Joe Gomez is still there as a versatile utility option to fill in gaps where they may appear in the back four, but for all their dizzying quality across the pitch, now Liverpool do appear alarmingly reliant on a 34-year-old Virgil van Dijk being able to play pretty much all of the football – and there is so very much of that football – for at least the next four months.",
      "Given the outlay Liverpool have made elsewhere – and we’re not knocking any of that because we are giddily excited about watching what this team produces – that just seems a daftly unnecessary position to have put themselves in.",
      "And the argument that Liverpool had done what they needed to do to remedy it with Guehi just doesn’t really wash; if you leave such a vital deal until the very last minute you always leave yourself at the mercy of a transfer chain breaking down with a potentially devastating domino effect.",
      "",
      "Spurs’ centre-back hole is perhaps less immediately conspicuous than Liverpool’s because they have two unquestioned top-tier starters in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, as well as slightly less lofty ambitions for the season as a whole.",
      "What they don’t really have is anything much else if or far more realistically when either/both of those two is unavailable. And while both that pair are top-class performers on the pitch, neither has really proved themselves too reliable at getting on that pitch 50+ times a season.",
      "Romero is in his fifth season at Spurs and has only once managed more than 27 Premier League games. Last season he featured in less than half Spurs’ 38 games.",
      "Van de Ven and his rubber-band hamstrings have played in 43 of Spurs’ 79 Premier League games since joining in the summer of 2023.",
      "Kevin Danso is a perfectly capable third-choice centre-back, and when everybody’s fit also provides Thomas Frank with the back-three option he deployed against PSG.",
      "Beyond that, though, Spurs find themselves relying on Ben Davies. We love Ben Davies, but a Champions League club should not be relying on Ben Davies in big 2025. After that, it looks like poor Archie Gray getting thrown in at the deep end again.",
      "Easy to see why Spurs enquired about Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake at City; harder to see why they didn’t really seem to try much else when neither of those avenues proved productive.",
      "",
      "Hard to escape the notion that 49ers Enterprises have let Leeds and Daniel Farke down in the closing days of the window.",
      "There was a lot of promising early work after promotion, with a clear priority for signing some really big lads. A policy we can all get behind for any promoted team embarking on a survival mission.",
      "But even as that process was taking place there was a curious lack of attackers among that collection.",
      "Goalkeeper, defence and midfield were all strengthened really quite impressively, but it’s going to mean nothing if Leeds can’t put the ball in the net.",
      "Sure, having concerns about Patrick Bamford’s injury record and deciding to replace him with Dominic Calvert-Lewin is very funny and everyone likes funny, but this is serious business, lads. It’s no time for banter and whimsy.",
      "Leeds have left themselves dangerously short of creativity and attacking quality in a league where staying in games and frustrating opponents really can only take you so far.",
      "Farke and his team have shown across a challenging first three games that they can certainly compete – even against Arsenal they kept them at arm’s length pretty easily for over half-an-hour before a Classic Set-Piece Goal – but one goal from a contentious penalty in 270 minutes tells a story.",
      "One point against Newcastle was perfectly good, but it could so clearly have been three with just a bit more attacking oomph.",
      "And while Arsenal away is not a fixture upon which Leeds’ season stands or falls, what was alarming there was not really the unflattering final scoreline but the complete and total inability to get out and try to land any kind of punch of their own. The sight of a team with giants in defence and midfield launching the ball to Dan James, Willy Gnonto and Joel Piroe and watching it come straight back every time was borderline comical.",
      "Farke said he needed two attacking players in the closing days of the window and he was right. He got none. It might cost him and Leeds everything.",
      "",
      "Never ask a woman her age, a man his salary, or a Newcastle fan how Yoane Wissa engineered his deadline-day move to Tyneside.",
      "There’s a very decent case that Brentford’s most conspicuous and damaging black hole is to be found in the dugout where Keith Andrews (for now) occupies Thomas Frank’s big chair. But on the field they’ve been decimated with the two leaders of last year’s attack in Bryan Mbeumo and Wissa off to pastures new.",
      "The wide-forward positions have been addressed in numbers at least – although Brentford do seem to have ended up with a large collection of players who would by choice operate from the left.",
      "Igor Thiago has thus far stepped up gamely to his new first-choice role through the middle with two Premier League goals and another in the Carabao, but he is literally the only centre-forward left in Brentford’s squad, with none of their ragbag collection of wingers and wide forwards particularly compelling ‘Could do a job through the middle, at a push’ candidates.",
      "There could be worrying amounts of unconvincing Kevin Schade false-ninery ahead for the Bees.",

      "MAILBOX: Liverpool beware: ‘humiliated’ Newcastle will ‘punish’ their ‘sickening entitlement’ over Isak",
      "But, rather than bringing in a new midfielder, Man Utd decided to splash £74m on Sesko, who scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.",
      "And now our friends at TEAMtalk claim that Man Utd have ‘locked in’ the signing of Brighton midfielder Baleba with transfer insider Dean Jones insisting it could be part of a ‘double midfield swoop’ in 2026.",
      "Man Utd were put off a move for Baleba this summer over the huge price tag with the Seagulls hoping to get a fee similar to the £115m received from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "TEAMtalk add that Man Utd enquired this summer in order to show Brighton they are serious about signing the Cameroon international and the Red Devils are ‘not deterred by the prospect of having to spend over £100million’.",

      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel in mid-August: “Baleba, he’s a young kid, he’s a wonderful talent, high ceiling. [But] what I would say is, it’s about managing expectations if someone like him does come in.",
      "“By no means am I saying that you buy him and he’s the absolute answer and he’s the key to everything being unlocked. He’s a young kid who will need to develop. He’ll need to be integrated into the squad, into the system.",

      "Thursday 4 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",

      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles return as defending Super Bowl champions after dethroning the Kansas City Chiefs in a 40-22 victory in New Orleans in February, denying Andy Reid's side a third straight championship.",
      "Josh Allen's Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens resume their pursuit of a Super Bowl berth in the face of Kansas City's monopoly on the AFC, while Jayden Daniels leads a new era for the Washington Commanders. The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",

There will be some Crystal Palace fans who are delighted that he stayed and others who felt the club should have cashed in.",
      "David Moyes spent most of the summer desperate for signings and the additions of Jack Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall have already started paying off in the Premier League, with over 70 per cent of readers approving their business, the most overwhelming result of any club.",

      "Big-name signings in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko helped take Man Utd's spending to £232.4m while they were also able to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Antony.",

      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",

      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper impressed United. No 'keeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10, respectively.",
      "It is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for their other goalkeepers, it would be considered.",

      "Lammens is now the fifth signing of the summer for Amorim, taking their summer spend to £232m, following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The keeper was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and the sale represents nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.",
      "He made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season for Antwerp, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "Speaking on the club's official channels after signing, Lammens said:",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential.",
      "\"We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "\"Manchester United have signed Senne Lammens with an eye to the now as well as the future.",
      "\"The 23-year-old keeper, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department after a shaky start to the season by the likes of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp, United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years time.\"",
      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",
      "\"An interesting thing is that when Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, they were tracking him then. So there's obviously been a like there for quite some time.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""

      "It seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.",
      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",

      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",

      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",
