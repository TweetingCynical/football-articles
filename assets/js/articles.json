      "Michael Carrick led Manchester United to another impressive victory(Image: ( James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images))",
      "Michael Carrick was summoned to speak to Sir Jim Ratcliffe mid-interview following Manchester United’s dramatic win over Arsenal. Matheus Cunha scored a stunning late goal as United completed a thrilling 3-2 comeback win at the Emirates to dent Arsenal’s Premier League title bid.",
      "The Gunners took the lead just before the half-hour mark when Lisandro Martinez put the ball through his own net, but Bryan Mbeumo capitalised on a horror backpass by Martin Zubimendi to draw United level before the interval. Patrick Dorgu then fired the Red Devils ahead before Mikel Merino looked to have rescued a valuable point for Mikel Arteta’s side.",
      "However, Cunha’s stunner three minutes from time secured his side all three points. The result means United sit fourth in the table and are well placed in the chase for a Champions League place next term.",
      "Carrick has now won both of his first two matches in charge, and former Premier League forward, now broadcaster, Jan Age Fjortoft has revealed he was summoned to speak to Ratcliffe just before he was due to interview the former England international.",
      "Taking to X, he wrote: \"Was standing at my position waiting for our Michal Carrick - interview today. Just as I was ready to ask the first question, a representative from Manchester United stopped my preparations and said: - Michael, Sir Jim wants to see!",
      "“So out he went, having a chat with him in the tunnel, and we got Carrick outside at our table Pitchside, where we could ask him about his “meeting”.\"",
      "Then, during an interview with Viaplay, Carrick was asked for an insight into the conversation he had with Ratcliffe in the Emirates tunnel. “No, not much as you would expect, I think,\" he replied. \"There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”",
      "Peter Schmeichel then put the United boss on the spot by asking him if he had asked if he could come into his office today, to which a laughing Carrick replied: “No, not yet, Peter. I think it is nice when you can have that feeling with a big win like this, you know, coming away from home.",
      "“Last week was good for different reasons. This one is pretty special. Two good games – it’s about what’s next now and moving forward.”",
      "Speaking after the win in the capital, Carrick said: \"We understood the start of the game was going to be like that, as much as we tried to turn the momentum in our favour.",
      "“I think we understood how the game was going to go and the flow of it. I thought we started to take the ball and connections through the pitch, had that composure and a few moments gaining a bit of confidence as well.”",

      "Before he continued: \"We were having a decent spell and seemed to be coming into the game when they scored, which was disappointing. Again, we showed the character to come back and there were stages in the game where you have to defend.",
      "“They make you defend the box really and it's challenging at times, but I thought we had enough in the game to keep believing in the confidence and I always fancied us to score.”",
      "Talk has turned to whether or not Carrick should be considered to take over permanently after his brilliant start but that is an idea Roy Keane, who has previously clashed with the United boss' wife, is dead set against.",
      "\"Even if they do get into fourth, I still wouldn't be convinced he's the man for the job. Absolutely not, I still think they need a bigger and better manager, but he's got the opportunity, what a chance for him and, you know what, he's taken it, so, fair play to him.\"",

      "The Brazilian came off the bench to score the winner in a five-goal thriller at the Emirates, which saw the Red Devils come from behind to beat the Premier League leaders.",
      "The win comes after Carrick presided over a victory over Manchester City in his first game in charge. It has furthered his own case to land the job beyond the summer, when his remit will end, and the ex-player is tapping into the experience he gained whilst he was a player in Manchester.",
      "Carrick has galvanised the squad, with their latest win lifting them into the top four, with the 44-year-old underlining to the players just how important it is to don the United shirt.",
      "Cunha said: \"He played here so many years. He knows the feeling for Manchester United. He spoke with us and told us how big it is to play for this club. He said everyone is against us, so we have to go on the pitch and give everything.\"",
      "Carrick has been equally complimentary of the summer signing, who joined from Wolves, as he praised the way he responded to starting on the bench in each of their last two games, before appearing in the second-half to score three minutes from the end.",
      "\"He [Cunha] epitomises what we've been like,\" said Carrick. \"He has not started both games and he's been disappointed not to start. But he's used it in a really good way. He's had a real big impact and two huge moments. I fancied him to score when the ball came out of his feet. He totally deserves it because of how he has applied himself.\"",
      "Michael Carrick has won his opening two games(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Harry Maguire has returned to the fold and believes having the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad back from AFCON, coupled with the quality Cunha is offering off the bench, has been a difference maker.",
      "He said: “Obviously, we’ve got a much bigger squad now, we’ve got the lads back from AFCON, obviously got players like Matheus, coming off the bench, who, I’m sure he’s not too happy sat on the bench the last couple of games, I know what he’s like and he wants to play, but I must say he’s made the difference in the two games.",
      "\"He’s come on against City and changed the game, and today again, he’s made the difference for us. It just shows the squad of players, the attacking talent that we have now to come on and do that.”",

      "Carrick said after the win: “I know from our perspective, it's just moving forward to the next game. It’s been less than two weeks we’ve been together. So it's just keep getting good habits, really, and good routines and good habits. The boys have been fantastic with that. I don't think we can look too far ahead.",
      "\"We certainly won't be, anyway. It's a big week leading up to Fulham and games coming up. We'll finish where we finish by getting the results. I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really. So we've taken this week by week, and game by game. We'll certainly continue to do that.",
      "\"But we've got to ride it and use the emotion, you have got to use the energy and use the confidence. You've got to be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results. It doesn't just come easy, so we need to continue that and bottle it and use it again.\"",

      "Wenger said on BeIn Sports: \"When you concede three goals at home it's difficult to win. The goals scored on both sides illustrated a little bit the way the two teams played.",
      "\"The games of Man United they are well built up, good cohesion, and the games of Arsenal were more decided by power and fighting on the corner, for example with the second goal. The first goal, as well, was not clean play. They gave everything Arsenal but lacked a bit, as I said in the first half, the patience and technical cohesion.\"",
      "He went on to add: \"I believe that Carrick has found a good formula that is a good balance between defensive stability and a good technical level. It's the first time I felt the [Arsenal] centre backs were a bit more nervous and less dominant than usually in the games.\"",

Meanwhile, Oliver Glasner will also leave Selhurst Park come season's end, leaving the Eagles to scour the market for a new head coach.",

The 44-year-old inspired a 3-2 win over Arsenal in north London on Sunday evening to remain unbeaten as the Red Devils' interim head coach.",
      "It comes off the back of a 2-0 win over bitter rivals Manchester City in his maiden game at the reins last weekend, with fans and pundits worldwide noticing a fresh-start fever under Carrick at present. While his short-term contract is viewed as exactly that, and that United will assess their options in the summer, it hasn't stopped the speculation that the club could already have the man who holds the keys to their success going forward.",
      "Asked about whether he hopes to take charge of United next season in the wake of Sunday's win at the Emirates Stadium, Carrick replied: \"I'm enjoying it. It's a fantastic position to be in.",

      "However, the stone-faced former club captain replied: \"The job? No, you're being silly now. Yeah, two great performances...anyone can win two games, it's what he does at the end of the season.",
      "\"Even if they do get into fourth, I still wouldn't be convinced that he's the man for the job. Absolutely not. I still think they need a bigger and better manager. But he's got the opportunity - what a chance it is for him, and do you know what, he's taking it so fair play to him.\"",

Oliver Glasner is another head coach who has seen his name tossed into the hat for a shake-up this summer.",

The Red Devils enjoyed an emphatic 3-2 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday evening, in a match that was jam-packed with drama.",
      "As a result, Carrick is unbeaten in his first two matches in charge of United, having stepped in on an interim basis until season's end following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this month. However, former club captain, Keane, isn't convinced that the 44-year-old should be considered for permanent tenure at Old Trafford.",

Lisandro Martinez conceded an own goal 29 minutes into play while hashing a clearance in his six-yard box, inadvertently setting the tone for what ultimately unfolded as a high-intensity match packed with drama.",
      "However, Arsenal didn't hold the advantage for long. Around eight minutes later, Declan Rice's inaccurate pass back toward David Raya was intercepted by Bryan Mbeumo, who quickly rounded the shot-stopper before firing into an open goal.",
      "Five minutes after the break, Patrick Dorgu found the back of the net with a wondrous volley from the edge of the area, as United looked to hold onto a 2-1 lead for the remainder of the meeting. Mikel Merino managed to level matters with around six minutes of normal time left to play, but his efforts were ultimately nulled and voided just three minutes later.",
      "That's because Matheus Cunha sealed the deal for United with a curling effort spiralling past Raya, before wheeling off in celebration. Up next for Carrick and United is a home match with Fulham in a week's time. Arsenal, meanwhile, take on Kairat in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, as they continue to chase glory in Europe.",

      "Arsenal took the lead on the half-hour mark as Lisandro Martinez deflected Martin Odegaard's strike into his own net. United found themselves level before the break as Bryan Mbeumo profited from a woeful Martin Zubimendi error.",
      "The Red Devils then completed the turnaround with a stunning strike from Patrick Dorgu. It looked as though Arsenal would seal a point however, as Mikel Merino prodded home from yet another corner.",
      "But United still had one more late show in them, with Cunha firing home from distance to secure a dramatic victory. Here are all of the talking points from the Emirates Stadium:",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "It was a relatively quiet start at the Emirates, with both sides struggling to generate chances within the opening half an hour. That was until Lisandro Martinez put through his own net to give his side the lead.",
      "It wasn't a goal that was generated with much beauty as the Red Devils struggled to deal with an overhit cross. Bukayo Saka then picked out Martin Odegaard, who lashed towards goal.",
      "But his effort took a touch off of the heel of Martinez and eventually beat Lammens. It might not have been the most eye-catching goal but anything helps in the race for the title. Arteta then will be fuming his side could not hold on.",
      "Lisandro Martinez's own goal saw Arsenal go ahead(Image: Getty Images)",
      "After his strike last time out against Manchester City, Mbeumo needed to be on top form against Arsenal for United to stand any chance. And he was certainly tuned in at the Emirates as he picked off Martin Zubimendi's terrible backpass to round David Raya and equalise.",
      "It was a notable strike for the Cameroonian for a number of reasons. It represented his eighth league goal of the season since his summer move from Brentford, while it was his 50th Premier League goal in all.",
      "While Mbeumo has been one of United's standout performers this season, the same could certainly be said of Patrick Dorgu. After key goals against Newcastle and Man City over recent weeks, the defender was at it again at the Emirates.",
      "Following a smart exchange with Fernandes, the left-back unleashed a brilliant effort that flew into the Arsenal net via the crossbar. There was a brief VAR check for a potential handball but the goal was eventually given.",
      "Dorgu has certainly had his critics at Old Trafford since his arrival but he now finally appears to be matching up the expectations of a Manchester United player. It's a massive shame that he had to be withdrawn late on with injury.",
      "Patrick Dorgu celebrates his sensational goal vs Arsenal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Arsenal were on the ropes heading into the final stages. And they needed a rescue act. It's a good job that they have the man capable of providing one.",
      "Having acted as an emergency striker in the past, Mikel Merino was introduced and just about prodded over the line to seemingly seal a point.",
      "But fellow substitute Matheus Cunha was not going to allow that to happen. The Brazilian picked up the ball 25 yards from goal and thundered a cracker past Raya to leave the Arsenal goalkeeper and the rest of the Emirates Stadium floored.",
      "There was a fair amount of scepticism around when Carrick was appointed as Manchester United boss. After all, this was a man who had not long been sacked by Championship side Middlesbrough.",
      "But something just appears to click whenever he takes his place in the United dugout. He has now gone five games unbeaten across his two spells, having gone unbeaten against Mikel Arteta, Pep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel.",

With the game level 1-1 after a thrilling first-half, the Red Devils full-back played a couple of cute one-twos with Bruno Fernandes on the edge of Arsenal's area before unleashing with venom with a volley.",
      "The ball, on an upward trajectory, clattered off David Raya's crossbar before bulging the back of the net, as Dorgu wheeled off in celebration. However, there was a quick VAR check in the aftermath, given that the 21-year-old looked to have handled the ball before his strike.",
      "\"That's what VAR just said, it looks like it's hit his hip. On field decision is correct, goal is given.\"",
      "In a game filled with drama from the outset and throughout, it was Arsenal who struck first. The Gunners piled on the pressure early doors as they looked to make a statement on home soil, with Lisandro Martinez making a hash of a clearance in his six-yard box 29 minutes in. which saw the ball bundle into the back of his own net.",
      "However, Arsenal didn't hold the lead for long. Around eight minutes later, Declan Rice's pass back towards Raya was intercepted by Bryan Mbeumo, with the Cameroonian coolly rounding his opposing goalkeeper and blasting the ball into a gaping goal.",

      "The German coach had a fantastic impact early on, winning four of his first five games, convincing the Saints hierarchy to appoint him permanently. Things have rapidly gone downhill since, with Eckert winning just four of his following 12 games including Sunday’s 1-1 draw with fierce rivals Portsmouth.",

      "He said: “For the week or so that it’s been so far, looking too far down the track hasn’t happened so far. It’s just been the initial thoughts of what’s happening now. What the important thing for me is that any decision I make, my staff make, or the club make, it’s not short-term, It’s not just to get through to the end of the season.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",

      "\"We'll certainly continue to do that, but we've got to ride it. You've got to use the emotion, you've got to use the energy, you've got to use the confidence, but be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results and it doesn't just come easy.

      "Patrick Dorgu is enjoying a purple patch and scored an incredible goal to fire United into the lead in the second period. Arsenal equalised through Mikel Merino, but there was another twist in the tale when Matheus Cunha came off the bench to make it 3-2 with a superb shot from the edge of the box.",
      "Michael Carrick has started his interim gig with wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. United have moved to fourth in the table, which means they are now in a promising position to qualify for the Champions League. Here are the moments you might have missed...",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Dorgu shocked himself",
      "Dorgu scored one of the finest goals of the season and didn't know what to do with himself as he celebrated. The 21-year-old was just as stunned as everyone in the crowd at his strike.",
      "There were limbs in the away end as Dorgu made his way over to the corner. Once he'd been mobbed by his teammates, Dorgu shook his head at the TV camera, as if he was thinking, 'how did I do that?'",
      "The Dane has gone from strength to strength over the last few weeks and his confidence is flowing. He had the audacity to take a swing from the edge of the box, and the execution was perfect. Arsenal goalkeeper Raya had no chance as the ball kissed the crossbar on its way into the net.",
      "Carrick made a bold decision to start Dorgu in the Manchester derby and he vindicated that selection by scoring. Dorgu would have felt 10ft tall in training this week, and he probably wouldn't have attempted the shot without that belief.",
      "The importance of corners",
      "Before facing United, Arsenal had scored 24 goals from set pieces in all competitions this season - the most by any team in Europe's top five leagues. They have earned a reputation as being deadly from set-plays during Arteta's tenure, and it was clear that United had been prepared for that threat.",
      "Casemiro cleared the first Arsenal corner of the game, winning the header amongst a scrum of bodies, and Maguire reacted by enthusiastically applauding him as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Every corner felt like an event, and there was a sense of anticaption around the ground when United conceded a set-play. The players fed off that energy, and Dalot whipped up his teammates as United prepared for Arsenal's second corner of the match, which was successfully cleared.",
      "Carrick prepared his side in training to deal with set-pieces. United conceded from two corners at the Emirates in December 2024, and work had been done to ensure they would not suffer the same fate.",
      "However, it's still difficult to stop Arsenal from corners, even when you prepare to face their threat. They piled bodies into the box, and Senne Lammens was crowded when Merino scored to make it 2-2.",
      "Casemiro appreciation",
      "Casemiro turned to the bench and first pumped when Mbeumo equalised in the 34th minute. United celebrated in the corner, and Casemiro briefly considered saving his legs before deciding to join in.",
      "It was announced earlier in the week that he will leave United upon the expiry of his contract. The Brazilian is hugely popular with matchgoers and was serenaded by the away section.",
      "United are set to sign a replacement for Casemiro in the summer transfer window, and it will be a good sign if his successor becomes half as popular with fans.",
      "Mbeumo's trademark",
      "Mbeumo scored his ninth goal of the season to fire United back into the game, and he used the same celebration as he did against Liverpool at Anfield, outstretching his arms.",
      "He used the same celebration when he scored against Tottenham in November, and it feels like it's becoming Mbeumo's trademark to wheel it out when he scores against 'big' clubs.",
      "It must be irritating for opposition fans to see Mbeumo celebrating in front of them like that. The 26-year-old has been a brilliant signing and possesses the kind of confidence that you need to represent United.",
      "Carrick was composed",
      "Luke Shaw received tactical instructions from Carrick while United celebrated their equaliser. Carrick moved his hands while he was locked in conversation, and he appeared to ask to move the ball quicker.",
      "Some managers may have got carried away in the euphoria of the goal on the touchline, but Carrick remained composed and used the time to pass on instructions after spotting something that could be improved.",
      "Remarkably, Carrick did not even show emotion when Cunha scored to make it 3-2. Instead, he began a dialogue with his backroom staff. There was finally a release of emotion from the 44-year-old at full-time.",

      "Hello and welcome to the MEN's Manchester United live blog on Monday, January 26.",
      "It's been a remarkable weekend for Michael Carrick and his side, with United earning a dramatic 3-2 win over Premier League leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Bryan Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha found the net to secure a second straight victory.",
      "Off the pitch, attention now turns to recruitment - both for the remainder of this month and ahead of the summer. The January transfer window closes on February 2.",
      "United continued to be linked several players, and a central midfielder appears to be at the top of their shortlist, with Casemiro set to depart at the end of the season. The Brazilian announced he will be leaving United when his contract expires in the summer.",
      "Elsewhere, Cole Palmer, Noah Sadiki and Wilfred Ndidi are the latest names linked with United, while Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Ruben Neves have been the focus of speculation for weeks - and in some cases, months.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "We will bring you all the latest news throughout the day...",
      "According to the Mail, United view Mouzakitis as a medium-term investment to bolster their midfield.",
      "The 19-year-old Greek player has made a strong impression at Olympiakos since breaking into the club's youth ranks in 2024. Given his current club's preference to keep him until the end of the 2025/26 season, it could be another deal to revisit in the summer.",
      "Michael Carrick - 1/1",
      "Oliver Glasner - 7/2",
      "Gareth Southgate - 8/1",
      "Thomas Tuchel - 10/1",
      "Unai Emery - 14/1",
      "Julian Nagelsmann - 16/1",
      "Mauricio Pochettino - 16/1",
      "Roberto De Zerbi - 16/1",
      "Xabi Alonso - 20/1",

      "Kieran McKenna - 33/1",
      "Zinedine Zidane - 33/1",
      "*BetFred odds correct at the time of writing.",
      "Man United's focus on Sunday would have been on their Premier League clash against Arsenal, but some eyes may have been across the capital at Selhurst Park.",
      "Adam Wharton was in action for Crystal Palace in their match against Chelsea, with the midfielder being heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent months. Palace were on the receiving end of a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea on home soil, in a game that ended early for Wharton.",
      "The England international was sent off for two yellow cards picked up in quick succession in the second half at Selhurst Park. Even though the game ended in a way Wharton would not have liked, it’s unlikely to see rumours linking United with a move for the midfielder come to an end anytime soon.",
      "Palace are also reported to have placed a £100million price tag on Wharton’s signature for last summer and for the January transfer window.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Man United have asked about the conditions of a potential deal for Ndidi, according to Turkish journalist Mustafa Karatas.",
      "United are said to be weighing up a £12 million bid 'including a purchase option' for Ndidi, who only arrived at the Turkish club last summer. It's also noted that United's plan is to bring in the combative midfielder on an initial loan.",
      "Caught Offside understand that Man United are tracking Rennes striker Mohamed Kader Meite.",
      "It's said that his rapid rise in Ligue 1 - marked by maturity, blistering pace and a clinical eye for goal - has alerted several Premier League clubs.",
      "Aside from United, Chelsea, Brighton, Tottenham, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Brentford have all sent scouts to watch Meite over the past month.",
      "The Sun report that Palmer is feeling unsettled at Chelsea - missing friends from his home city.",
      "It's said he could be tempted either by a return to Man City or a move to Man United, the club he grew up supporting.",
      "However, Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior has reiterated the midfielder is happy at Stamford Bridge, saying: \"I’ve had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems very, very happy to be here. He is very, very happy to be here. He’s a huge part of our plans in the long term.",
      "\"He’s an outstanding player. Every player goes through difficult moments in their careers in terms of injury. But my job and the club’s job is to get him in a place where he can consistently perform at the level that he wants to.",
      "\"And there was frustration in the Brentford game, not because he wasn’t happy here, just because he couldn’t perform. He was in pain. He couldn’t perform to the level he wanted to do for the club.\"",
      "Man United are reportedly considering extending his contract until 2031, as Michael Carrick begins to give him more regular playing time to aid his development.",
      "According to a report from the I, Man United have placed Adam Wharton at the top of their midfield shortlist ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Casemiro will leave Old Trafford at the end of the season, prompting the Reds to search the market for an appropriate replacement. United reportedly view Wharton as a worthwhile investment as they seek to strengthen an ageing midfield.",
      "Should United succeed in their pursuit, it would represent a significant setback for Palace, particularly as they have already lost Marc Guehi to Man City this month, whilst Jean-Philippe Mateta's future at the club remains uncertain.",
      "We’ll be bringing you all the latest rumours, analysis and breaking news from in and around Old Trafford throughout the day.",
      "Grab yourself a brew and let's get started."

      "Matheus Cunha celebrates his dramatic winner for Manchester United against Arsenal(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick praised the way Matheus Cunha channelled his disappointment at not starting either of Manchester United's wins against Manchester City and Arsenal, after coming off the bench to have a major impact in both matches.",
      "Cunha got an assist at Old Trafford when he created Patrick Dorgu's goal but was the hero of the hour at the Emirates, firing in a stunning winning goal from 25 yards just moments after Mikel Merino had equalised for Arsenal.",
      "That capped off a madcap game in North London, with United coming from behind to lead 2-1 after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and a thunderbolt from Dorgu, but Carrick felt Cunha's reaction to being dropped summed up the spirit on show in the first two weeks of his spell in charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Matheus coming on and having a big impact again, like he did last week,\" Carrick said. \"Creating a goal last week. I really fancied him to score. Again, fantastic finish. Kind of epitomises probably what, as a group, what the what we've been like this week. Matheus has not started both games, but he's had a real big impact and he's been disappointed not to start, but he's used it in a really good way.",
      "\"Two huge moments and he totally deserves that winning goal for that, how he's applied himself all week and I'm absolutely delighted for him.\"",
      "Dorgu's 20-yard volley had given United the lead and although it was a stunning finish, Carrick was pleased with the quality of the move leading to the goal and hailed the impact of the Dane in his first two games in charge.",
      "\"The move for Pat was a really good move, and the connection through the pitch, but to finish it the way he did was some finish,\" he said.",
      "\"Pat's been a big player for us over the last couple of games. I think in so many ways, attacking wise, obviously he scored two goals, but I think in terms of the threat and his athleticism and his quality coming in as well, and connections. I think the defensively he's been immense as well, down the side with Luke and doubling up against two teams that ask a lot of questions down the side",
      "\"It's a big, big job for him and I'm delighted for him because the two goals he scored, very different goals, but you get that because he's put so much into the performances. It's nice to see him smiling and happy.\"",
      "Dorgu came off towards the end after clutching the back of his leg but Carrick is hopeful it was just a bout of cramp.",
      "\"Hopefully a little bit of cramp, hopefully it's nothing worse, but he ended up coming up like that and just shows what he's put in, really, to the performance,\" he said. \"At this stage it's hard to tell, so we'll just have to wait and see, but yeah, for sure we're hoping that it's not too bad.\"",

      "Arsenal equalised through Mikel Merino in the 84th minute, but there was another twist in the game when Matheus Cunha scored three minutes later to secure a huge victory for United.",
      "When Ratcliffe left the stadium, he was asked if he could speak to reporters. \"No, no, no,\" he said before adding, \"just get the smile\" and gesturing that his lips were sealed. Then the United co-owner was asked whether he was happy with the result, and he responded: \"Very, yeah.\"",

      "Speaking to the BBC, Carrick said: \"It was a good day. I think we had to put a lot into that game, an awful lot. Credit to the boys, so proud of them. We had to sustain some attacks, especially earlier on and we grew into the game.",
      "\"We had a setback, come back strong, had a setback towards the end, come back strong. So many elements to the game that were good. We're so fresh whether it's 10 days in, two games, it's never going to be perfect at this stage, especially coming against a team like Arsenal.",

      "Manchester United celebrate Matheus Cunha's goal against Arsenal(Image: )",
      "Manchester United continued their dream start under Michael Carrick as they secured back-to-back wins against the Premier League's top two with a famous victory at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It felt like United had weathered the early storm from Arsenal when the hosts took the lead. It was a sloppy goal to concede and Lisandro Martinez got the final touch as he battled Jurrien Timber in his six-yard box.",
      "But United's response was excellent and they capitalised on an Arsenal defensive blunder to level. Martin Zubimendi's pass handed the chance to Bryan Mbeumo and he rounded David Raya to score.",
      "Carrick's side then took the lead with a stunning goal early in the second half. Dorgu teed the chance up for himself with some clever control and unleashed a stunning volley that hit the bar and went in. Mikel Merino looked like he had secured a draw for Arsenal only for Matheus Cunha to score almost immediately.",
      "Here's the MEN player ratings.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Senne Lammens: Good saves from Zubimendi and Saka and mostly dealt well with the aerial bombardment. Crowded out for the equaliser. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Dealt well with Trossard and looks a little more comfortable at right-back. The kind of solid and unfussy game he has needed. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Surely worth a new contract if this form continues. Looked the best centre-back on the pitch, which really is saying something. 9",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Should have been stronger against Timber for Arsenal's opening goal. One good block on Rice but Gyokeres troubled him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended really well against Saka and stayed aware throughout. Arsenal used clever moment down that flank but Shaw was never exposed. 8",
      "Casemiro: Big contribution in his own box from set-pieces and used the ball well. Another reminder that he can still cut it at the highest level. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Felt that United got a foothold in the game when they got the ball to Mainoo more often. Growing in confidence under Carrick and got the late assist. 8",
      "Amad: Took in-swinging corners and got his deliveries spot on. One poor choice on the break in the first half but kept at it. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Curious game. Sloppy with a couple of passes but also had moments where he looked really dangerous and led well when in front. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Weak defensive header in the build-up to the first goal but boy did he make amends. An incredible goal to put United ahead and maintain his own momentum. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Now scored against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. Took his goal really well and was a threat with his movement and clever runs. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Took up some good positions and again looked bright off the bench. Brilliant, brilliant goal. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Little time to make an impact. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Late sub. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Heaven, Malacia, Ugarte, Mount",

      "Matheus Cunha celebrates scoring for Manchester United at Arsenal(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick stood motionless on the Emirates touchline. Hands behind his smart black jacket, dressed to kill like a Manchester United manager should be. Inside, his stomach must have been churning.",
      "He raised his left arm to try to wave his team forward, but his right arm never moved. He looked like the calmest man inside a stadium that had long since lost its head.",
      "A couple of minutes earlier, Casemiro had grabbed the back of Matheus Cunha's shirt and slammed him into the turf in sheer delight. That wasn't even to celebrate the forward's stunning goal, but to mark him winning a free-kick from an Arsenal corner. The emotions were everywhere, from a United side finding its mojo again to an Arsenal team that just can't take control of this title race.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Everywhere apart from the away technical area, that is. United's coaches poured out to appeal for a late free-kick as they defended another Arsenal cross. The unflappable Carrick barely flinched.",
      "When the full-time whistle blew, Carrick clenched his left fist and twice subtly punched the air next to him. There was a low-key embrace with his staff and a handshake with Mikel Arteta. For the 44-year-old Carrick, this is just what Manchester United do.",
      "As auditions go, this couldn't have got off to a better start. Carrick has guided United to wins against the Premier League's top two when a month ago they had looked like a team devoid of confidence and lacking enjoyment. This win against Arsenal was the kind of dramatic away-day success the very best United teams produce.",
      "They have had some moments to savour in the FA Cup here in recent years, but they hadn't won a league match at the Emirates since December 2017. That was the day of David de Gea's 14 saves and Jesse Lingard's double in a 3-1 victory under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim had tried and failed to win a league fixture here. Carrick had at least some experience of success. He was among Solskjaer's staff for an FA Cup fourth-round win on a Friday night in January seven years ago.",
      "A lot had changed since then. Arsenal have gradually built to a point where their 22-year title drought could end in the next five months. United have cycled through a succession of failed managers and are back on another short-term appointment in Carrick. Short-term for now, at least.",
      "The feelings of de ja vu are pretty hard to escape right now. Carrick has delivered exactly the kind of uplift Solskjaer brought in December 2018, both in mood and performance. He has to be in the frame to get the job permanently after these victories. Any more of this and it may prove impossible to overlook him.",
      "This was a different kind of win, as well. They started the derby well last weekend and built the confidence that comes from seeing a game plan work on the pitch.",
      "At the Emirates, they began on the back foot. They faced a flurry of early set-pieces and Senne Lammens turned over a header from Martin Zubimendi at point-blank range. Set-pieces had seemed Arsenal's likeliest route to goal, but it felt like United had weathered the storm when they went behind.",
      "Patrick Dorgu failed to deal with Piero Hincapie's cross, Bukayo Saka found a pass to Martin Odegaard and his mis-hit shot was sliced into his own net by Lisandro Martinez. You feared for United at that point, but the response was exceptional before and after half-time.",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost capitalised on a defensive error from William Saliba before Bryan Mbeumo punished Zubimendi. The Spaniard's pass back towards his goal only succeeded in playing in United's false nine and he rounded David Raya before finishing.",
      "Arsenal had been shooting themselves in the foot, but they were powerless to stop the goal that gave United the lead. Dorgu manipulated a bouncing ball into a more promising position and then sent a 20-yard rocket fizzing past Raya, the ball hitting the underside of the bar and bouncing into the roof of the net to give the strike the kind of aesthetic it deserved.",
      "Dorgu's renaissance over the last five weeks has been one of the stories of United's season. He had struggled in the first half here, not only with Arsenal's goal but against Saka, who got far more joy against him than he did the excellent Luke Shaw. But Dorgu's future surely belongs further forward if his recent contributions in the final third are anything to go by.",
      "Arsenal piled the pressure on in search of an equaliser and looked to have rescued a point when Mikel Merino bundled a corner over the line, but United again responded almost immediately. Kobbie Mainoo poked a clever pass to Matheus Cunha, who bent a stunning shot from distance into the corner of the net.",
      "As the majority of the Emirates emptied, United's players gathered in front of a delirious away end at full-time. Casemiro handed his shirt to a fan, and Carrick was serenaded several times. By the time Cunha and the immense Harry Maguire finished their TV interviews, it was still full. There was time for one final flurry of fist pumps after a breathtaking victory.",

      "United grew in confidence last week after a good start but it’s been backs the wall stuff here in the first 15 minutes. United are defending well but Amad wasted their one counter-attacking opportunity by making the wrong pass. Arsenal keeping the Emirates involved at the moment and dominating territory. United trying to slow it down.",
      "Arsenal have made a decent start, as you'd expect at home. United need to take the sting out of the game and quieten the crowd."

      "Alejandro Garnacho has sent Bruno Fernandes a message on social media following Manchester United's 3-2 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Patrick Dorgu scored an incredible goal to fire United into the lead in the second half following Bryan Mbeumo's equaliser.",
      "Arsenal were able to level the scores, but Matheus Cunha restored United's lead shortly after coming off the bench with a superb strike from the edge of the box. Interim head coach Michael Carrick has made an impressive start to his interim spell, overseeing victories against Manchester City and Arsenal.",

      "This prompted a response from Garnacho, who replied with: \"T best.\"",
      "Garnacho appears to have followed United closely since leaving Old Trafford for Chelsea in a £40million summer move, bringing his three‑year spell at the club to an end.",
      "Dorgu also responded to the post, writing \"Nice assist,\" followed by laughing emojis. Cunha then hailed the Portuguese midfielder as the \"IQ man.\"",

      "Chelsea star Cole Palmer, who has emerged as a potential United target, showed his approval by liking it.",

      "Carrick remains undefeated in his first two games in charge of United, having taken over temporarily until the end of the season following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim earlier this month.",
      "However, former club captain, Keane, is sceptical about the idea of the 44-year-old taking on the role permanently at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Yeah, two great performances...anyone can win two games, it's what he does at the end of the season. Even if they do get into fourth, I still wouldn't be convinced that he's the man for the job. Absolutely not.",

      "\"I still think they need a bigger and better manager. But he's got the opportunity - what a chance it is for him, and do you know what, he's taking it so fair play to him.\"",

      "Arsenal started strongly, applying intense pressure on the visitors from the get-go. Lisandro Martinez unfortunately scored an own goal 29 minutes into the match while attempting a clearance in his six-yard box, inadvertently setting the stage for what would become a high-stakes, drama-filled encounter.",
      "However, Arsenal's lead was short-lived. Roughly eight minutes later, Bryan Mbeumo intercepted Declan Rice's errant pass back to David Raya, swiftly rounding the goalkeeper before slotting into an open net.",
      "Five minutes into the second half, Patrick Dorgu found the back of the net with a stunning volley from the edge of the box, giving United a 2-1 lead they hoped to maintain for the rest of the match. Mikel Merino managed to equalise with about six minutes of regular time remaining, but his efforts were ultimately undone just three minutes later.",
      "Matheus Cunha secured the victory for United with a beautifully curled shot that spiralled past Raya. Carrick's United will next face Fulham at home in a week's time.",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of the season. United have taken the unusual step of announcing five months before the Brazilian's contract was due to expire that he will be leaving the club this summer.",
      "The 33-year-old moved to Old Trafford from Real Madrid in August 2022 for a fee rising to £70million, signing a four-year deal with an option for a further season. But the club have decided against triggering that extension, and the MEN understands the decision was made well before Thursday's announcement as part of their long-term planning.",
      "The MEN also understands that Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option and asked the club to make their plans public in order to \"bring external clarity\" to the situation.",
      "Casemiro, who has scored 21 goals in 146 appearances for United so far, said: \"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life.",
      "\"From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months.",
      "\"We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",

Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid in 2022 in a deal rising to as much as £70m, scoring 21 times in his 146 games so far from the base of United's midfield.",
      "After helping the squad to a League Cup and FA Cup win, there had been calls to sell the ageing midfielder, but this season has shown that he is still more than capable of being a key man, most recently at the derby win over Manchester City. Posting on his Instagram account, Casemiro said: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Commenter Antw writes: \"People underestimate how good Casemiro actually is. He’s had a few off games, but when we played Lyon at Old Trafford & miraculously won, Casemiro had a part to play in all of the last 3 goals. He won the penalty, he set up Mainoo & also set up Maguire. Unfortunately his legs are giving up.\"",
      "Chrisssssss says: \"Yeah sad to see him go, but realistically seems like a sensible decision. Always more humble than I imagined.\"",

      "For others, thoughts are already turning to what comes next for United's midfield. 1968red says: \"Well at least it will free up a few quid for a replacement, but it's been money well spent since we signed him. Wish him all the best and thanks for the memories Cas.\"",
      "Rightwing7 wants to see a similar character come in through the door: \"One of the best, if not the best DM in football history. Unfortunately for us, we got only 30% of the best Casemiro, but he give us 100% of what was left in his tank. Never complaining, 100% professional. Wish we can get a young 'Case', like the one when he was in his prime. All my respect for a fantastic football player, and I wish him well in future.\"",
      "Some would even like to see him remain at United in a different capacity. On our Facebook page, Ng Yoon Fatt says: \"This guy is a fantastic professional. He could be an inspiration to our kids in the academy. Personally, I would want to keep him, of course at the right price.\"",
      "Peter Bowker agrees: \"He should be put on the coaching staff in the academy. He is like Cantona, he commands respect. Been a great football player.\"",

      "Now, it's time for the centre of the park. While that seemed likely to be the focus of the recruitment team anyway, that need has been accelerated due to Casemiro's situation.",
      "Man United have confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club this summer at the end of his contract, with the decision made not to trigger the extra year that is included as a clause in his deal.",
      "The Brazilian was one of the last major investments in the midfield, with around £60m spent on securing him from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "While there have been some highlights, it seems United are keen to move on and look at the future beyond the 33-year-old, which puts greater emphasis on their deals in the summer.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at a few potential replacements for Casemiro in the transfer market, and what they could offer the team in the years ahead.",
      "Adam Wharton has already proved he has the skills and qualities to slot into any Premier League squad at present. However, given he is currently wanted by the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool and Spurs, United will face stiff competition in securing his services this summer.",
      "A fee north of £65m could also await any interested parties, given the 21-year-old is already Premier League proven.",
      "While Wharton is thought to be United's main interest at present, it is thought that Elliot Anderson is also being monitored. The 23-year-old has been a shining light in a struggling Nottingham Forest squad this season, but a deal will not come cheap.",
      "That's because the Tricky Trees have reportedly slapped Anderson with a price tag of around £100m.",
      "United pursued Carlos Baleba for the majority of the summer, only to be put off by Brighton's £100m valuation of the 22-year-old. An interest still remains in the midfielder and it will be interesting to see if the Seagulls' stance on letting him leave the south coast changes this summer.",
      "Joao Gomes has excelled with Wolves despite the club staring directly down the barrel of imminent relegation. The MEN reported earlier this week that a loan with an obligation to buy for the 24-year-old would be a most likely move. Wolves reportedly want £40m to let him leave midway through 2025/26.",
      "Like Baleba, United found themselves linked with Real Madrid's Eduardo Camavinga in the summer. The 23-year-old has been a revelation at the Bernabeu, with Arsenal and Liverpool said to be monitoring him. It was reported last month that Los Blancos will listen to offers around the £87m mark."

      "\"I think it’s reflective of the tough times that the club’s going through and there's a genuine fear that they could fall out of the top 10 next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe describes them as the world's leading football brand, but if the world's leading football brand is outside of the top 10 of revenue generators, then that's not very promising.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim steered United to the final of that competition in Bilbao, but even that didn't make up much of the shortfall to being outside of the Champions League at a time when a seat at Europe's top table is more financially rewarding than ever.",
      "\"With this new Swiss model, the Champions League is worth an absolute fortune,\" he said. \"And being in the second competition, you're probably getting around about a quarter of the money that you'd get.",
      "\"Even United getting to the final, they would have earned less money than the likes of City would have generated from being knocked out by Real Madrid in the play-off round.\"",
      "The value of Champions League football shows how important it is for United to secure a return to that competition this season after two successive years away.",
      "Last weekend's win against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge has put them back in fifth, which should be good enough to qualify, although the league table remains congested.",
      "If Carrick can steer United back to the Champions League and they enjoy a good season next year, then it should put them back on track financially as well.",
      "\"One successful season can do it,\" explained Maguire. \"Every match at Old Trafford in the Champions League is worth £8million or £9million in terms of ticket sales, so you've got a minimum of four matches.",
      "\"You get to the quarter-finals, you're probably looking at six or seven, so that's £60million. They'll pick up £70million or £80million in prize money as a minimum if you get that far. That’s £150million, then you get the extra £10million from Adidas and other sponsors will be kicking in as well, so that’s the thick end of an extra £200million and they bounce back to where you would expect them to be.",
      "\"Paradoxically, Manchester United fans, from a financial point of view, should want City and Liverpool to do well in the Champions League because that will cement that fifth place, which could be the difference as far as next season is concerned.\"",

      "Manchester United scout Antonio Cruz has confirmed he is leaving the club after 18 years of service as a first-team talent-spotter in Portugal and Spain.",
      "Known as Toninho, Cruz confirmed his departure on LinkedIn, and he is the latest scout to leave Old Trafford as the club follows the modern trend of using data and AI to aid their recruitment and player watching.",
      "A former lower-league player in Portugal, Cruz is one of dozens of full-time scouts to leave United over the past 12 months, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's second round of redundancies including a slimming down of the scouting department.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "More than 80 full-time scouts were employed at that time, but swathes have been made redundant or moved on as director of recruitment Christopher Vivell seeks to overhaul what Ineos felt was an antiquated set-up.",
      "Writing on LinkedIn, Cruz said: “After 18 years at Manchester United as an International Scout, the time has come for me to close this important chapter of my career.",
      "“Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey.”",
      "Cruz joined United in 2007 and as well as scouting first-team players in Portugal and Spain, he would offer valuable insight into Portuguese opponents ahead of European fixtures. His biggest success story from a recruitment perspective is helping scout Bruno Fernandes, who joined the club six years ago.",
      "United recently advertised for three new roles at the club to assist with their data-led approach, with the aim of appointing a senior football data scientist, a senior football data engineer and a senior software engineer.",
      "The data scientist would be involved in solving \"football-related questions\" across men's, women's and academy teams and that data would be used in recruitment.",
      "United appointed Michael Sansoni as their director of data in April. Sansoni previously worked at the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team, which is part-owned by Ineos.",
      "Ratcliffe was critical of United's approach to data after investing in the club, telling the United We Stand fanzine it was \"still in the last century of data analysis\". Sansoni has been handed the power to bring United up to speed in terms of data, with some of their Premier League rivals enjoying a significant head start.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "“The first time we saw a glimpse of what he could be was actually under Amorim when he played him as a wide right.",

Arsenal are nervous, create absolutely nada, sterile in possession and, you guessed it, cannot score one single goal. Bournemouth managed 3 at home to a Liverpool side with less injuries than the one El Fraudo faced. Nevertheless, the verdict from Islington MAGA? “1 point gained, Citeh and Villa dropped points”.

Again, Arsenal midfield lacks creativity, lethargic, soporific and dull. Arsenal to their credit finally manage a goal from open play (the opposition scored it naturally) Like Liverpool at home: the Fake Champions-elect are passive, cannot create and cannot score.

I bet on ManYoo to win this match because Carrick showed against Citeh that he’s brave enough to attack and take risks – whereas, as I’ve eternally maintained, Arteta is a coward plain and simple.

      "So after all that, it turns out that managing Manchester United is actually a piece of piss.",
      "Okay, that may be a conclusion too flippant to make the 16 in the wake of the Red Devils’ impressive win at Arsenal on Sunday. But there is certainly a strong argument for Ruben Amorim being one the easiest-ever managers to follow in the Premier League era.",
      "With each passing game under Michael Carrick’s control, the folly of Amorim’s religious devotion to a system that suited almost no-one at Old Trafford becomes more stark.",
      "Carrick came in after Darren Fletcher acted as first responder and in just two games, United might not be ‘back’, but they certainly look a sight closer to what a United team ought to.",
      "What’s Carrick’s magic formula? Play players in positions and a formation that suit their individual and collective talents.",
      "It really is that simple. Sure, Carrick and his coaching staff will have found other ways to lift a woefully-underperforming squad – taking ketchup off the contraband list, that sort of thing – but to make the biggest difference, all they really had to do was get out of the players’ way.",
      "That is not to diminish Carrick’s achievements so far. Going unbeaten against City and Arsenal would have been a very creditable return. To spark United to be the first team in a decade and a half to win back-to-back games against the top two is quite remarkable.",
      "MORE: 16 Conclusions from Arsenal 2-3 Man Utd: DNA, bottle, retro kits, Carrick, Arteta, Mbeumo and more",
      "But, more than anything, it highlights just how much Amorim’s stubbornness was holding United back.",
      "From being a team whose shortcomings in the middle third set them up to fail at either end, the Red Devils suddenly appear defensively solid and threatening going forward. It was all so bleedin’ obvious.",
      "Amorim is hardly the first and only coach to make it all about himself. Fans and the wider public now insist upon a philosophy, a recognisable style – usually recognisable because almost every other team is trying to play the same way – and identifiable patterns of play. More than anything, Amorim sought to make United the embodiment of his principles, at the cost of, y’know, winning football matches.",
      "Carrick was hired to keep it simple. That’s all United needed in the Amorim aftermath.",
      "In a system more familiar to every single one of them, the players look free. Liberated from Amorim and their own minds, no longer second-guessing each instinct while making 3-5-2-1 appear a quadratic equation.",
      "Any team will always be the sum of its parts and the improved performances of individuals is just as damning on Amorim as the collective revival.",
      "The most obvious: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Amorim deemed the England international – it wasn’t that long ago –  incapable of playing in the base of his midfield because… reasons. Mainoo might not have always helped his own cause but the fact him and United came as close as they did to giving up on each other highlights the misplaced priorities during Amorim’s reign.",
      "We know Mainoo is technically good enough for the role. His ability to cover the ground was questioned but in two starts under Carrick, he ran further (11.89km against City and 11.26km at Arsenal) than any other player on either pitch.",
      "Mainoo’s presence means Bruno Fernandes can play higher. Putting the skipper, one of Europe’s most creative players, on a leash held by three centre-backs ought to have been a sackable offence in itself. That Fernandes made the best of it reflects far better on him than the departed manager.",
      "Giving Mainoo and Fernandes the platform each need to thrive were such easy and obvious wins, Carrick probably could have been forgiven for thinking it was a trap.",
      "Any manager needs luck and Carrick has benefited from the timing of his appointment. Mainoo was just out off the treatment table when he walked into the dressing room and doubtless the change of manager helped speed the healing process. Fernandes too was just back from injury, as was Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Paul Scholes might not fancy the World Cup winner much but it is clear to anyone without an agenda that United, in and out of possession, are a much better with Martinez as part of a duo – not a trio – at the heart of their defence.",
      "If Carrick’s luck holds, and United keep their key players fit through the remainder of his interim rein, on the evidence of his first two games, he could back the board into the kind of corner they haven’t easily wriggled out of in the past.",
      "United will be egged on to keep Carrick more with each win, the danger of doing so only matched by refusing to even consider the possibility that he could be a leading candidate come the end of the season.",
      "The prematurity of that debate makes it tiresome already, but February will offer a clearer picture of what United and Carrick might be capable of. In contrast to opening with the top two, four of their next five games are against bottom-half sides, the type of opponent that tripped up United almost as often as they stumbled over themselves under Amorim.",
      "Roy Keane wouldn’t give Michael Carrick the permanent job at Man Utd even if the interim boss won “every game from now until the end of the season”.",
      "Arsenal are bottling this Premier League title. Some people are loving it and others are despairing. It makes for a great Mailbox.",
      "Liverpool fans are despairing at this Liverpool team and what Arne Slot is doing to this team of champions.",
      "Andy Robertson to Spurs would have topped this lot, but there have still been five pretty strange deals in this January transfer window…",
      "Time to crack out the testing kit and find out just what is in that Michael Carrick Man United DNA after a 3-2 win at Premier League leaders Arsenal.",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he’s spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating the Norwegian to the Man Utd interim head coach role."

      "This has still been unexpectedly impressive, obviously, and it does need saying that for all United were ultimately good value for their win here that it still relied on two spectacular goals. That’s not a particularly repeatable tactic.",
      "But these first two weeks of Carrick’s temporary(?) reign have shown that it never needed to be anything like as bad as stubbornness made it for so, so long.",
      "",
      "4. As for Arsenal… are they really doing it again? Surely they’re not doing it again? It’s an impossibly harsh but unavoidably relevant question. Arsenal’s recent history means the scope for things to become painfully self-fulfilling at this point is unbelievably potent.",
      "It is patently ridiculous that a team losing a 24-0-0 all-competitions record when scoring first is damned for the loss of such a record rather than praised for its existence. But nobody will be making these points more forcefully than Arsenal fans themselves. Nobody will be more aware of what this might be than Arsenal fans themselves.",
      "There was a desperate, palpable nervousness about Arsenal today as they sought to respond to victories for Man City and Aston Villa earlier in the weekend.",
      "",
      "5. And while the point about the spectacular nature of United’s second and third goals applies just as much to not over-reacting to Arsenal’s defeat as it does to over-reacting to United’s victory, it’s not as if they were bolts from the blue. These were not rogue misfortunes that derailed an otherwise acceptable performance.",
      "Arsenal were nowhere near it, and weirdly got more nervous and less certain after what should have been a perfect nerve-settler of an opening goal.",
      "",
      "6. It had been an odd start to the game before it burst so dramatically to life. Arsenal were in total control, but it was an eerily sterile dominance. Arsenal had all of the ball and all of the territory but before getting their goal via a swing and a miss from Lisandro Martinez led to the ball cannoning in off his standing leg, they had created precious little.",
      "At one point in the first 15 minutes Arsenal had completed 22 passes in the final third to United’s zero. Yet Arsenal had nothing really to show for being in such utter control of proceedings. The goal would eventually come, but it never felt like it definitely would. Never had the sense of inevitability you’d expect.",
      "It never, in fact, felt as inevitable as United’s equaliser did almost from the moment Arsenal went ahead. As for Martinez, we can only say that perhaps that goal wouldn’t have happened if he’d just bothered to be slightly taller? Something to think about there.",
      "",
      "7. So soon after Arsenal’s opening goal did United’s first glimmer of a chance come that Peter Drury hadn’t even finished his prepared soliloquy before grudgingly accepting the need to mention with a sigh that Bryan Mbeumo was now to be found bearing down on goal.",
      "That chance came to nothing, but another miscommunication at the back soon after created another chance for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "This time it required an extraordinary recovery from William Saliba to prevent an equaliser. Having initially let the ball run past him, presumably unaware of the lurking danger, he then somehow stuck out a telescopic go-go-Gadget leg to get their first and scupper Bruno’s shot.",
      "",
      "8. But the reprieve was temporary. Arsenal’s third and most egregious error in five baffling minutes saw Martin Zubimendi, usually the most reliably safe pair of hands imaginable, make a horrible mess of a backpass after having a pass fizzed into him with unnecessary pace.",
      "Mbeumo still had plenty to do, and did it with what is becoming customary style as he shimmied round David Raya to score his 50th Premier League goal.",
      "He is already one of the signings of the season and is developing a happy knack for scoring premium goals.",
      "That’s now goals in victories at Anfield and the Emirates, as well as in a home win over Man City. It’s a fine return on investment in his first season, and he was sorely missed during that dispiriting run of draws around the new year when he was away on AFCON duty.",
      "",
      "9. It would have been easier to forgive Arsenal’s first-half sloppiness and nervousness had they been shaken out of these navel-gazing afflictions at the interval. But they weren’t.",
      "The second half began very much as the first ended, with United encouraged to believe there was far more here for them today than anyone might have anticipated.",
      "Of course there’s an air of freakishness to Patrick Dorgu scoring what Gary Neville called on commentary ‘a goal of a lifetime’ but these are the things that can happen when you offer opponents as much seemingly unnecessary encouragement as Arteta’s side has taken to doing.",
      "Having played a sort of double one-two with Fernandes, Dorgu arced his shot spectacularly beyond Raya even before we’d fully completed the thought that we hoped he didn’t do that because it would force us to try and describe the set-up and ‘double one-two’ feels entirely unsatisfactory.",
      "",
      "10. We do feel we have to take some responsibility for Arsenal’s shoddiness here. You can’t go around publishing Quadruple Content on the morning of a match without expecting egg to be instantly administered to faces.",
      "Of course, nothing is f*cked here today. Arsenal are still four points clear. They are still heavy favourites to win the league. They probably haven’t just commenced a bottlejob. But we must all accept they are slightly less compelling quadruple candidates this evening than they were this morning.",
      "But whatever happens over the weeks and months ahead, they will have one quadruple to look back on thanks to the mass Hail Mary substitution Arteta attempted just before the hour to try and rejuvenate what was by now a thoroughly moribund performance.",
      "Four substitutes, Mikel? Four? That’s insane.",
      "In fairness, the introductions of Mikel Merino, Eberechi Eze, Ben White and Viktor Gyokeres did energise Arsenal a bit.",
      "",
      "11. Or at least, they energised the crowd. There was a conspicuous cheer for the introduction of Gyokeres in particular. It might not have been a good day for Arsenal, but Gyokeres wouldn’t be human if he didn’t feel something at the sight of Gabriel Jesus so utterly failing to stake a claim to a regular starting spot when handed the chance in a big game.",
      "",
      "12. And we were certainly invested in the idea of Ben White scoring an equaliser and then celebrating in Steve Holland’s face. Although even here we saw doubt and uncertainty from Arsenal where none has existed before. Hincapie’s return and White’s deployment in the reshuffle from the bench meant Myles Lewis-Skelly once again reduced to a watching brief.",
      "There still appears to be a lack of real belief in the youngster when the chips are truly down.",
      "",
      "13. Arsenal scored an equaliser of such unparalleled Arsenalness that it barely requires description. The words ‘corner’ and ‘Merino’ and ‘bundled’ and ‘goalline technology’ are all you need to know to form a perfect image of it all in your mind. Or failing that, in your planet-melting AI of choice.",
      "A subdued Emirates suddenly came alive with expectation. A horribly unpleasant afternoon was now pregnant with the possibility of some real Hallmark of Champions behaviour and possibly even some stern words and tut-tutting from the Celebration Police. There was surely only one winner from here, you thought to yourself.",
      "",
      "14. And you were right. In fairness, this is where a degree of caution must be particularly advised for those going all-in on Carrick’s club-knowing DNA-possessing Unitedness being the difference maker in a big away game at a long-term rival.",
      "Because really what United went and did here under Carrick is just what they went and did under Amorim at Anfield; after conceding a late equaliser, they went and found a late winner.",
      "It was another stunning goal, wonderfully and precisely worked with no panic or late-game-bluster before Matheus Cunha calmly curled the ball into the bottom corner from 25 yards like it was a tap-in.",
      "And as a general point, it does become even harder to avoid the temptation to compare this United to previous all-conquering iterations when they do this sort of thing to league leaders while dressed as the 1994 team in that wonderful black Eric Cantona kung-fu tribute kit.",
      "",
      "15. Victory finally takes United into a wide-open top four that has been waiting for them all season long. Nobody appears remotely interested in what is for now (but almost certainly won’t end up being) the final Champions League spot, with United among the most egregious offenders with all manner of daft results against daft teams when opportunity knocked previously.",
      "Now, after back-to-back wins against teams that are not daft, the chance has been taken. And there really does seem no good reason to think United can’t remain precisely where they now find themselves given who they’ve now eliminated from their fixture list.",
      "Nobody could accuse United of appointing an interim at a time designed to give him a straightforward start, but having beaten City and Arsenal it really could get even better for a while yet.",
      "United, infamously, are not overburdened with fixtures for the rest of the season, but even so they have what looks like an outrageously gentle February after this potentially punishing end to January.",
      "If they can avoid the classic ‘win the hard games, then mess up the easier ones’ trope, then a February featuring Fulham and Tottenham at home before trips to West Ham and Everton could be a rewarding one. Haircuts all round if that lot goes the way current form suggests it should.",
      "",
      "16. For Arsenal, a first home defeat of the season. And the loss of that 24-0-0 record in all competitions when scoring first. And three goals conceded in a Premier League game for the first time since a 4-3 win over Luton Town in December 2023.",
      "We haven’t crunched all the numbers but are going to say that it must at the very, very least be rare to concede three goals against a team that is relegated twice before you concede three goals to anyone else. If United get relegated twice before the next time Arsenal concede three then we’re all in trouble.",
      "The ridiculousness of that stat and indeed the nature of the goals Arsenal conceded today – two worldies, one silly gift – should also be a reminder of just how ridiculous and unbreakable that Chelsea goals conceded statistic really is.",
      "There was some talk earlier in the season that Arsenal could threaten the absurd 15-goal mark of Terry and Carvalho and Cech and, above all, Mourinho. We get it; Arsenal are an exceptional football team who at their best specialise in denying their opponents any chances whatsoever.",
      "But the fact that record is already off the table with 15 games still to play should give anyone pause next time someone comes along with an impressive pair of centre-backs and high-class goalkeeper.",
      "Roy Keane wouldn’t give Michael Carrick the permanent job at Man Utd even if the interim boss won “every game from now until the end of the season”.",
      "Michael Carrick has tapped in enough open goals at Man Utd that his early success as interim manager says more about his successor…",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he’s spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating the Norwegian to the Man Utd interim head coach role.",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed when Casemiro’s exit from Manchester United was decided, while David Ornstein believes he has an advantage over other managers.",
      "Man Utd interim boss Michael Carrick is likely to be “in the mix” to become the permanent Red Devils manager in the summer, according to David Ornstein.",
      "Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood insists that Benjamin Sesko “should be nowhere near” Michael Carrick’s starting XI at Man Utd."

      "Arsenal are doing it again, aren’t they?",
      "Manchester United were very good. Michael Carrick is at the wheel. Yadda yadda. More of that in 16 Conclusions.",
      "But Arsenal…wow. This is shaping up to be the worst bottlejob of the lot, and losing at home to their great rivals feels like the first step towards it.",
      "The Emirates felt edgy right from the start. Arsenal looked tentative, predictable, and nervous.",
      "It was a strange first half; the Gunners didn’t necessarily start poorly. For the opening 15 minutes, United couldn’t get out of their own half, but as soon as they did, the equilibrium shifted. Arsenal’s nerves and United’s confidence grew in tandem.",
      "Arsenal’s opener should have settled the anxiety, but if anything, they looked even shakier after taking the lead.",
      "In a game where the first goal felt pivotal, it proved to be so in a way we didn’t see coming. The hosts looked even more unsettled, and a calamitous Martin Zubimendi error led to Bryan Mbeumo’s 37th-minute equaliser.",
      "Under an insignificant amount of pressure, the Premier League’s best among the 20 most expensive signings of the season bobbled a woeful backpass towards David Raya, getting nowhere near it as Mbeumo calmly swept up the mess.",
      "They didn’t look like a team four points clear at the summit with a game in hand. Instead, they looked like a team desperate to relinquish the burden of being chased by Manchester City and Aston Villa.",
      "That passivity bled into the second half, and Michael Carrick’s men took full advantage.",
      "Patrick Dorgu’s go-ahead goal was spectacular, and having spent the evening refusing to take any risks, Arsenal were suddenly forced to show some character and inventiveness. They had to show us what they’re made of, basically.",
      "Mikel Arteta showed what he was made of almost instantaneously, hauling off four players in an unprecedented quadruple substitution before the hour mark.",
      "Benjamin White, Mikel Merino, Ebere Eze, and Viktor Gyokeres replaced Piero Hincapie, Martin Odegaard, Martin Zubimendi, and Gabriel Jesus. It gave Arsenal height, set-piece threat, and a delicious delivery specialist, and, alas, their equaliser came via a six-yard-box scramble from a corner.",
      "But on a day when not even the dark arts could bail Arsenal out, they were undone by another absolute belter, this time from substitute Matheus Cunha.",
      "Ironically, just as the Arsenal supporters looked like they believed and were fully behind their team, Cunha’s sucker punch sent the hosts right back to where they were four minutes earlier.",
      "It has been an almighty crash in recent weeks. Three games without a Premier League win. Their first home defeat of the season. The first time in 25 league games they’ve gone 1-0 up and failed to win. And the first time Arsenal have conceded three goals in a match since facing Luton Town back in December 2023.",
      "The connections weren’t there. Again. The individual sparks were non-existent. Again. It felt like the first significant step in Arsenal’s latest bid to bottle the Premier League title. AGAIN.",
      "It happened in quite remarkable fashion too, conceding two screamers against a Manchester United side enjoying a mini-revival under Carrick. The silver lining for Arsenal is that the Red Devils’ hierarchy and supporters might get giddy and hand Carrick the job full-time.",
      "As Gary Neville said on commentary, Arsenal didn’t lose the league today. They wouldn’t have won the league today either. But they are sending all the wrong signals. Wrong for them, right for a Manchester City team seemingly in crisis and an Aston Villa side that has no right to be third.",
      "City’s form has been poor, but they won on Saturday and will build on that momentum. Yet that will pale in comparison to the buzz generated by Arsenal losing at home in a fixture they had no right not to win.",
      "Even at kick-off, it felt like Arsenal players and supporters were bracing for disaster. That atmosphere was on the pitch and in the stands.",
      "Losing the 2022/23 Premier League was down to their title charge coming too soon. 2023/24 was one slip-up too many. Last season was just crap. If Arsenal don’t do it in 2025/26, it will be the worst of the lot by a country mile.",
      "If they do ultimately bottle it, this will feel like the first major step towards doing so.",
      "And as always, no one does more damage to Arsenal’s title hopes than Arsenal themselves."

      "Another year, another quadruple attempt. You can set your watch by them. Every January, some clever-clogs team will be chasing the quadruple before shamefully ending up with something embarrassing like only the Premier League and Champions League to show for it. Mortifying.",
      "Of course, there’s a good reason that the Full Quad in the world’s only proper football, which is obviously English football, and the four proper trophies available – Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup – has never been done. It is almost impossibly difficult. There is literally no shame in failing to complete it; that you can get past the halfway point of the season with something so impossible still theoretically possible is itself extraordinary.",
      "And Arsenal are right now among the less convoluted quad-chasers. They are top of the Premier League and top of the Champions League. They are current favourites in each of the four competitions. It really might happen. Except: it won’t. Because it never does.",
      "But that thought set us upon another thought: what is the best quadruple that has actually happened? We have, through necessity, allowed all manner of bullsh*t pots into this, but we have limited ourselves to Europe’s top five leagues for our own sanity.",
      "Unfortunately, that does mean no place for Celtic, whose 1966/67 Quintuple contains all the proper ingredients (European Cup, Scottish League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup) as well as a Glasgow Cup which, given the historical if not current nature of Scottish fitba, is at least as good as a League Cup probably. But if we included them, we’d have gone down a long, arduous yet inevitable road that leads directly to Linfield’s 1961/62 Septuple and pure delirious madness. So we haven’t. Soz.",
      "",
      "A Quadruple containing neither European nor domestic league glory? F*** all the way off, you cheeky scamps. You’re trying to pull a fast one here and we’ll not have it. Quadruple? Notruple more like.",
      "",
      "This was Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona at the peak of their powers and an indisputably great side, no doubt about that. They don’t need a Quadruple to prove it. Which is just as well, because this is still firmly in tinpot territory. We’ll give you La Liga, obviously, especially after losing just once all season and still only edging out Real Madrid by three points in an epic tussle. But the rule that any cup containing the word ‘Super’ is bobbins is immutable and in play twice here.",
      "The UEFA and Spanish Super Cups are (or were at the time) both two-team low-wattage affairs (albeit the Spanish version was played over two legs) and not really major titles. The FIFA Club World Cup may have slightly more teams, but we all know that in its historical pre-Trump format it amounted in the end to the old Intercontinental clash between the European and South American champs. Barca started the season with six titles up for grabs, but missed out in the Copa del Rey to Sevilla in the last 16 and to Jose Mourinho’s party-pooping Inter in the Champions League semi-finals.",

      "It must be quite nice to be able to go “This is the worst Quadruple we’ve ever won”. The inherent implications can only augur well. This is the worst Quadruple Bayern Munich have ever won.",

      "And this is the second worst. A far better one in 2012/13 opened the Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup doors, gifts that were duly accepted. In accordance with tradition, Guangzhou Evergrande were beaten en route to World Cup glory, while penalties were needed to exact a measure of revenge on Chelsea for the 2012 Champions League final in the UEFA Super Cup. But Bayern were thrashed in the Champions League semi-finals by Real Madrid and sloppily passed up the DFB-Supercup right at the start of the season with a defeat to old rivals Dortmund.",
      "",
      "Don’t hear as much about this as you do the 1999 Treble, do you? Even though four is definitely more than three. Can’t think why this is less venerated. Not every day you beat Gamba Osaka and Quito to land the Club World Cup. Or beat Portsmouth on penalties to win the Community Shield. You can stick That Night in Barcelona up your arse, quite frankly.",
      "",
      "Scores grudging bonus points for the fact they’ve done this particular quadruple four times since replacing Lyon as French football’s dominant force. No arguing with the neatness of that. There’s a very obvious reason it’s not as good as 2024/25’s effort, but three of the four here are at least actual competitions containing multiple matches and more than two entrants.",
      "We also quite enjoy the fact that because PSG weren’t even letting anyone else have a go in the League Cup – winning six of the final seven renewals – it was just abolished altogether. We assume that’s why it was chucked in le bin anyway.",
      "The Trophee des Champions sounds much better than ‘Community Shield’ and less deceptively bombastic than ‘Super Cup’ but amounts to the same thing. It’s just a glorified friendly between league winners and cup winners, and PSG have won loads of the buggers. This is a Quadruple built around a Domestic Treble and therefore not too tinpot, but inevitably loses some points because farmers and no Europe.",
      "",
      "A Proper Domestic Double is a high-quality cornerstone of any respectable Quadruple, and Barcelona tick that box in style here, putting a three-game April wobble behind them to win their last five league games by an absurd aggregate score of 24-0 to pip Real Madrid by a point. Sevilla were beaten in extra-time for Copa del Rey glory, but alas it then goes once more into the realm of the tinpot. Athletic Bilbao offered minimal Supercopa resistance, while Guangzhou Evergrande (it is always Guangzhou Evergrande) and River Plate (it is quite often River Plate) were sorted out with little fuss in the Club World Cup. The Champions League bid came a cropper against eventual finalists and domestic rivals Atletico Madrid in the last eight.",
      "",
      "Yes, another Champions League for Real Madrid. Nice one, Loris Karius is crying. The rest of it: tish and fipsy. Alright, so the Supercopa was against Barcelona, but it was still a fancy two-legged friendly. Al-Jazira and Gremio were dispatched in the Club World Cup and Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup. Real also finished second behind actual Tottenham in their Champions League group stage, and third in La Liga. Utter frauds.",
      "",
      "This is one of our favourite Quadruples. Because it highlights the absolute folly of it all. The whole Quadruple obsession vaguely reminds us of the razor blade wars when Gillette and Wilkinson Sword would constantly set out to one up each other by just adding blade after unnecessary blade. The Mach 3 was definitely enough, guys.",
      "And that brings us to Manchester City’s 2018/19 season, in which their Champions League hopes collided with the unstoppable chaotic banter force of Spurs with inevitable consequences, but they did complete an unprecedented English Domestic Treble. An achievement Sir Alex Ferguson had declared impossible, rightly acknowledging the League Cup is far harder to win than the Champions League. But here’s the thing: nobody cared.",
      "And, sure, a lot of that was because it’s City and people in general still don’t care about City the way they do United or Liverpool or even Arsenal. They still didn’t care all that much when they emulated United’s Proper Treble in 2023. But it wasn’t entirely that. Quadruple obsession had rendered Trebles meh. Ludicrous as that is.",
      "Still, though. Whack in the good ol’ Community Shield, and you have a Quadruple. And with all three proper pots pocketed in a league where that had never happened before or since it remains one of the better ones. And you can’t really blame anyone for coming off second best to Spurs with Fernando Llorente in his pomp, can you?",
      "",
      "Were it not for an extremely careless Copa del Rey quarter-final defeat over two legs to Celta Vigo, this would be challenging for top spot. The league title was snaffled after a typically forthright to and fro with Clasico rivals Barcelona, while a slightly scruffy Champions League group stage featuring three draws on their way to second place behind Dortmund was put right in a dominant march through the knockouts. Classic Real Madrid Champions Leaguing, really. They know their way around a UCL knockout tie better than most, a bother with which Man City are about to collide. Napoli and Bayern were beaten home and away in the last 16 and quarter-finals, while a 2-1 second-leg defeat to Atletico mattered not a jot with a 3-0 lead in the bag from the first. On to the final in Cardiff, and a 4-1 shellacking for Juventus. It is the history of the etc.",
      "Super Cup and Club World Cup formalities were also completed along the way, although extra time was required against both Sevilla in the former and Kashima Antlers in the latter. The Antlers were only in the tournament at all as J-League champions because Japan were hosts, but defied the odds to make it all the way to extra-time in the final, beating Auckland City, Mamelodi Sundowns and most notably Copa Libertadores champions Atletico Nacional (thanks in part to the first penalty ever awarded by VAR) along the way.",
      "",
      "We’re going to go right ahead and say it: winning the Champions League is better than winning the French Coupe de la Ligue. Let it never be said we are afraid of molten takes here.",
      "PSG seemed pretty happy, all in all, with a season that finally delivered that long-awaited first Big Cup success alongside a customary sprinkling of domestic baubles. But we’re still pretty annoyed that the abolition of the French League Cup meant no Proper Quad was achieved. On the flipside we are, in truth, relieved at their failure to win the summer’s Club World Cup because then we’d have had to decide which, if any, season it belonged to and we can’t be remotely arsed with that noise.",
      "But within the definite confines of the actual 24/25 season, the entire absence of the Coupe de la Ligue does leave this as a largely unimprovable effort with the domestic double at its core and the big European prize to go with the more tinpot Trophee des Champions.",
      "Of course, this season could set new benchmarks despite Coupe de France embarrassment. Having already won all three of the Glorified Friendlies available to them post-quad – Trophee des Champions, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Intercontinental Cup – and with a live interest retained in both Ligue 1 and Champions League there is a tinpot quintuple very much up for grabs.",
      "",
      "There is no Carabao equivalent in Germany, so this does have to go down as a largely unimprovable effort for Bayern, for whom a Quadruple featuring no tinpottery whatsoever is thus impossible. Won all three major pots in some style, breaking all manner of records on their way to a ludicrous 25-point victory margin in the Bundesliga and winning their six DFB-Pokal games by a combined aggregate of 20-2. Arsenal gave them an almighty scare in the Champions League last 16, winning 2-0 in Munich after a 3-1 Bayern win at the Emirates appeared to have put the tie to bed three weeks earlier. Sauntered past supposed European superpowers Juventus and Barcelona by scoring 11 goals and conceding none before outlasting Jurgen Klopp’s Dortmund at Wembley to take the Big Cup.",
      "We don’t want to get into the hypothetical, but it does seem pretty reasonable to assume this team that lost just once to a German side (2-1 to Bayer Leverkusen in October) all season long may well have won a German League Cup were there such a thing to be won.",

      "When the opening weekend of a Premier League season rolls around, there will always be excitable knee-jerk reactions to the first round of games.",
      "Teams and their players are often rashly written off after a disappointing start or hyped as the real deal, though these early assessments do not always reflect how the season pans out.",
      "This was particularly the case with Arsenal’s unconvincing 1-0 away win against Ruben Amorim’s supposedly resurgent Manchester United side at Old Trafford in August.",
      "At the time, there were the same old fears about Arsenal being held back by Mikel Arteta’s defensive mindset. Meanwhile, despite losing, Man Utd were widely praised for their positive performance that was tipped to indicate a much-improved season under Amorim.",
      "This has since been proven wrong on both counts, with Sunday’s reverse fixture pitting runaway Premier League leaders Arsenal against a Man Utd side with renewed optimism under a new interim head coach after Amorim ultimately failed to turn things around.",
      "So, ahead of Sunday’s match at the Emirates, we have revisited Matt Stead’s conclusions from the August fixture (he was right to be pessimistic about Man Utd) and detail ten main takeaways that have since been debunked and/or proven…",
      "",
      "‘Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.’",
      "Credit to Stead for shoehorning a great Vicar of Dibley bit into his dissection of one of Man Utd’s many false dawns, with good performances against top sides before losses against your Grimsby Towns, Brentfords and Evertons a hallmark of Amorim’s reign and other managers before him.",
      "We don’t need to go into what followed the Arsenal defeat right here, but those who naively felt Man Utd had turned a corner here were badly wrong, with this club now renowned for delivering letdown after letdown.",
      "Michael Carrick’s side will probably replicate the levels reached against Man City when they face Arsenal, but don’t be shocked if/when they lose against Fulham in their next game.",
      "READ: Paul Scholes should ‘f**king grow up’ as shock four-man Manchester United midfielder shortlist ‘revealed’",
      "",
      "‘Liverpool and Manchester City can make their four-goal statements before Arsenal stumble over their words, but the final message was all the same.’",
      "Arsenal were far from convincing in their 2025/26 opener, but their unrelenting reliability and defensive resiliance has given them a huge advantage over their title rivals, especially considering there’s been a significant drop off from Manchester City and Liverpool.",
      "",
      "‘A shiny penny to whomever is first to ask whether Arsenal are better without him.’",
      "Stead was pretty forgiving of Gyokeres’ first of many non-performances in a big game for Arsenal this season as he was far from 100% for the Man Utd match.",
      "Still, early signs of his ineffectiveness in the Premier League and in this Arsenal side were evident against Man Utd and have been laid bare in the months since. His stunning goal in midweek does little to gloss over the fact that he has been a huge disappointment and has not been the No.9 solution he was meant to be…",
      "",
      "‘Arsenal naturally looked smoother and more coherent when he came on but the difference in sharpness, technical levels and decision making against what came before with Gyokeres was clear.’",
      "As this season has developed, it has looked increasingly inevitable that Kai Havertz will eventually replace Gyokeres in Arsenal’s starting XI. And in actuality, the Swedish international’s situation is worse as he could realistically find himself third in the pecking order behind Havertz and Gabriel Jesus following the Brazilian’s unexpected resurgence.",
      "READ: Every Premier League club’s revelation of the season features Calafiori and The New Mbappe",
      "",
      "‘It turns out spending £200m on a completely new frontline while loaning out all the previous composite parts can rejuvenate it.’",
      "Man Utd’s performance against Arsenal may have proved a false dawn en route to Amorim’s long-overdue demise, but there are at least some positives for the club following a summer transfer window that was largely positive across the board.",
      "Before the Arsenal game, Man Utd had already completed their £200m attacking overhaul, and there were positive early signs from Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and, less so, Benjamin Sesko. They have further cemented themselves as integral players over recent months, but they need some help…",
      "",
      "‘It is not worth contemplating how much needs to be spent fumigating and then rectifying their other glaring problem positions… Brighton are going to extract a comical amount of money from skint Sir Jim next summer for Carlos Baleba. Whether this midfield can hang on for long enough is unknown.’",
      "While Liverpool attempted to fix all of their problems in a single window, Man Utd did not have the financial means to do so without Champions League football and opted to push back their plans for a midfield rebuild to this year.",
      "This has seemed a mistake, but Amorim’s exit and the return of Kobbie Mainoo ease their issues in this department. Still, as Stead mentions,  a marquee signing in Baleba’s mould is a must to fill the void left by Casemiro, with a four-man shortlist revealed.",
      "",
      "‘The goalkeeper situation is untenable… Investing hundreds of millions on forwards is pointless [without a new No.1].’",
      "Any chance of Alter Bayindir having a prolonged stint as No.1 following Andre Onana’s exit ended against Arsenal, with the stand-in proving a regen of his flaky predecessor.",
      "Bayindir would have likely cost Man Utd as many points as Onana, so Man Utd could not afford to not sign a new No.1 goalkeeper in the final days of the summer window. INEOS acknowledged this and landed Senne Lammens, who performed better than anyone could have anticipated as a brilliant fix for one of his side’s biggest issues. It’s ridiculous to suggest Emi Martinez could replace him.",
      "READ: Man Utd can’t repeat tactic which ‘broke Arsenal’ because Bruno ‘would be doing three people’s jobs’",
      "",
      "‘The way Raya has transitioned to becoming a genuinely brilliant keeper is not spoken of often enough, nor how Arteta absolutely nailed such a ruthless decision.’",
      "Lammens has been superb this season, but he still has a long way to go to match the standards of Arsenal standout Raya, who continues to make Arteta feel smug after upgrading Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "",
      "‘That sort of brutal, cutthroat call really might need to be made on Arsenal’s left wing at some point… Arsenal could charge a sizeable rent based on the room for improvement in that position; it really could hold them back.’",
      "At this stage, it’s hard to pick a fault with this Arsenal side as they are littered with quality options in every position. However, if they have a weak spot, it is on the left flank.",
      "Stead’s dismay was directed at Gabriel Martinelli, who Arsenal really need to cash in on this year to cut their losses, as his development has plateaued to the point where he is the weakest of Arteta’s wingers.",
      "Leandro Trossard’s return to form has been welcome this season, but he has a limited shelf life, so Stead’s point still stands and Arsenal’s next big-money signing should be a left-winger capable of having a similar output as Bukayo Saka on the right.",
      "",
      "‘Where the captain fits on this ship is unknown as the issues in slotting him into this system persist… Maybe £100m in exchange for a brilliant but incongruous 30-year-old wasn’t the worst deal.’",
      "The biggest thing Stead arguably got ‘wrong’ was his point about Fernandes, who re-established himself as an indispensable player against Man City in his preferred role as a lynchpin of Man Utd’s attack. He remains their only world-class player and Carrick (and eventually his successor) needs to build around the club captain rather than move him on to fund signings.",
      "READ NEXT: Man Utd will find it easier to find a new manager than a new Bruno Fernandes",

      "Arsenal are top of the Premier League, top of the Champions League, have one proverbial foot in the Carabao Cup final and are bookies’ favourites for the FA Cup.",
      "In other words, this is currently one of the more credible bids at the Proper Quadruple we’ve yet seen. Any talk at this time of the season is always, by definition, premature simply because actually winning the quadruple is vanishingly unlikely even when everything is going as swimmingly as it currently is for the Gunners.",
      "And if you don’t believe us about how small and twatty the banana skins upon which previous quadruple tilts have slipped, just have a look at this tale of hubris and despair and teams who ended up only winning two or three trophies like massive f*cking losers.",
      "",
      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Won\nChampions League: Won\nLeague Cup: Quarter-finals",
      "A philosophical question for you: if a quadruple bid ends before anyone even actually realises it’s started, does it make a sound? Clearly, nobody was talking about a quadruple – or even a treble for that matter – when Manchester United travelled to White Hart Lane in December 1998 for a League Cup quarter-final against Spurs. They were third in the league, five points behind leaders Aston Villa, hadn’t started their FA Cup campaign and were not yet certain of qualification from a Champions League Group of Death alongside Bayern Munich and Barcelona.",
      "But given everything that happened across the rest of that season, and while acknowledging that the Butterfly Effect applies to quickfire Chris Armstrong doubles after half-time every bit as much as it does to the flapping wings of world-destroying insects, you could make a decent case that this is still actually the closest anyone has ever come and they didn’t even know it.",
      "Sure, maybe the distraction of a two-legged semi-final against Wimbledon and a final against Leicester might have derailed United’s loftier ambitions but also: probably it wouldn’t. And given that even a phenomenally mediocre Spurs team managed to negotiate those games and actually win themselves a trophy (arguably a more notable thing than United’s Treble) you’d have to imagine an all-conquering United would also have done so; they didn’t lose a single game from December 19 onwards in that fabled campaign.",
      "Essentially it boils down to this: all else being equal, United only needed to see off teams who finished the season 11th, 16th and 10th to add a final (but also first) coat of shiny gloss to their greatest ever season. But David Ginola yet again had other ideas.",
      "",
      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Semi-finals\nChampions League: Quarter-finals\nLeague Cup: Semi-finals",
      "Bit harsh maybe to sully an unbeaten Premier League season with ‘What if?’ chatter, but Arsenal really were a few moments here and there away from something even more spectacular. If you take an unbeaten league season as the baseline, then ending up with only one trophy isn’t great is it? You know, relatively speaking.",
      "All three cups were distinctly winnable as well. Middlesbrough were Arsenal’s destroyers back then, beating the so-called ‘Invincibles’ home and away in the League Cup semi-final and then going on to defeat Bolton at the Millennium Stadium. Arsenal should definitely have won that one, really.",
      "Old rivals Manchester United knocked Arsenal out at the same stage of the FA Cup, but it was the still-elusive Champions League that was perhaps the real near-miss. Wayne Bridge’s 87th-minute goal secured victory for Chelsea at Highbury in a wide-open tournament that ended with Jose Mourinho and Porto beating Monaco in the final.",
      "So, in summary: Arsenal’s Invincibles are massive, massive frauds who lost four games to Premier League opponents. Next.",

      "In terms of keeping the dream alive as long as possible, few QUAD TILTS can match Chelsea’s 2006/07 effort even if they ultimately missed out on the two biggest gongs.",
      "Jose Mourinho’s teak-tough bastards got all the way to May with the big fish still on the hook having pocketed the League Cup and reached the FA Cup final – which they would also go on to win – while battling with Manchester United for the league title. Liverpool awaited in the Champions League semi-final.",
      "Chelsea led 1-0 after the first leg at Stamford Bridge, but Daniel Agger’s goal levelled the tie at Anfield and ultimately sent it to penalties where Arjen Robben and Geremi misses left Liverpool 4-1 winners.",

      "It all went tits up in April, though, when United failed to recreate that shoot-out success after another goalless 120 minutes against Everton in the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "United did win eight of their last nine games to secure the Premier League title, including that weird week where Federico Macheda became the most important footballer in the country, but failed to defend their Champions League crown after getting schooled by absolutely peak Barcelona in the final. No shame in that, of course. That defeat to Everton, taking with it the chance of an at-the-time-unprecedented domestic treble, constitutes the real dropped bollock here.",

Wigan were City’s nemesis at the time, though. Having hilariously and inexplicably denied City in the 2013 FA Cup final, Wigan returned to banter them off a second time.",
      "Sunderland had been dispatched in the League Cup final a week earlier, and City would famously go on to pip slippy Liverpool to the league title with five straight wins at the end of the season. But the quad dream came crashing down a week after the League Cup win as Wigan stunned the Etihad with a 2-1 victory in the FA Cup quarter-final before Barcelona completed the formalities of a last-16 Champions League win with a 2-1 victory at Camp Nou, having won the first leg 2-0 in Manchester.",
      "",
      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Fifth round\nChampions League: Quarter-finals\nLeague Cup: Won",
      "Wigan again. What witchcraft is this? The Latics once again denied the League Cup winners and record-breaking Premier League champions in the FA Cup. Fifth round this time.",

      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Won\nChampions League: Quarter-finals\nLeague Cup: Won",
      "The second treble winners to see their quadruple hopes dashed by Spurs. What a club.",
      "But unlike United’s 1998/99 bid that only became apparent with the benefit of hindsight, City’s 2018/19 was so dominated by talk of quadruples that their unprecedented domestic treble drew mainly shoulder shrugs and indifference.",
      "The dream died on a gloriously silly night of European football at the Etihad as Spurs arrived with a hard-won 1-0 first-leg lead they gave back almost instantly before Son Heung-min scored two just as quick to take Mauricio Pochettino’s side into an improbable two-goal lead with away-goal buffer to boot, back when such things existed.",
      "City roared back; with barely 20 minutes on the clock the scoreline was an absurd 3-2 to City on the night with Spurs now narrowly ahead in the tie by virtue of those away goals.",
      "When Sergio Aguero scored on the hour, City appeared to have done enough. Only for Fernando Llorente to scramble home a highly controversial third Spurs goal to restore their away-goal advantage. City thought they had won it again in stoppage time only for an agonisingly long VAR check to eventually spot an offside in the build-up.",
      "Reading all that back, it is truly incredible to think that wasn’t even Spurs’ maddest away night of a Champions League run so unutterably bonkers that UEFA had no choice but to scrap the away goals rule altogether in direct response. Maybe. Also a reminder of one of the key things that makes a quad so very hard to pull off: football is really bloody daft.",

      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Semi-finals\nChampions League: Runner-up\nLeague Cup: Won",
      "No Spurs or Wigan whimsy this time around, with Chelsea proving to be City’s undoing on this occasion. That’s slightly less embarrassing, at least but it did also occur twice.",
      "The quadruple has arguably never felt quite so feasible as it did on the morning of April 17 in 2021 when City, already in the Champions League last four and cruising to the league title with the Carabao safely in their pocket after Ryan Mason’s Spurs had been dealt with at Wembley, prepared to take on Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "But a close-fought game was decided by Hakim Ziyech’s goal. As if that wasn’t enough, Chelsea would go on to repeat the punishment in the Champions League final in Porto six weeks later, Kai Havertz this time netting the only goal as City’s bid to land all four trophies ended with a mere and quite shameful two.",

      "Perhaps technically the closest a Premier League club has ever come to winning the Quadruple, Liverpool already had a pair of domestic trophies to show for their efforts as they entered a seismic final week, facing Wolves at home in the Premier League before continuing their perennial search for vengeance against Real Madrid in the Champions League.",
      "Liverpool never were top of the Premier League on that remarkable last day but the opportunity was right there. With the gap to Manchester City a single point, Steven Gerrard had done his bit by guiding Aston Villa to a 2-0 lead at the Etihad as late as the 75th minute. But Pep Guardiola’s side maintained a slender advantage on goal difference for as long as Liverpool could not find a breakthrough against Wolves.",
      "The Reds did eventually vanquish their obstinate visitors, but by the time Mo Salah and Andy Robertson scored in the 84th and 89th minutes to make it 3-1, Manchester City had already completed their remarkable turnaround with goals from Ilkay Gundogan and Rodri in the 76th, 78th and 81st minutes to lead Villa 3-2.",

      "There are two possible ways to view only the second proper Treble in English football: through the prism of a slightly larger number in those 115 charges; or by laughing at how Nathan Jones stood in the way of history being made.",
      "Manchester City were kind enough to let Arsenal top the Premier League for most of the season before vanquishing the Gunners during a run of 12 consecutive and title-securing wins in one of Guardiola’s usual bouts of unstoppable post-Christmas form. The FA Cup was delivered a couple of weeks later with Manchester United beaten in the final, while seven days after that it was Inter who City just about managed to find a way past to end their wait for continental glory.",
      "Three trophies were in the bag but it really ought to have been four. Then again, what is a trophy-hoarding machine supposed to do when encountering a relegation-bound team and one of the worst managers in Premier League history? Nathan Jones was in charge of Southampton for 95 days and a list of the five teams he beat before being sacked is just incredible: Everton (who sacked Frank Lampard nine days later), Crystal Palace (who sacked Patrick Vieira 70 days later), Lincoln (who were in the bottom half of League One), Blackpool (who would be relegated from League One) and an otherwise all-conquering City.",

      "Looking at those eventual outcomes sums up how a) quickly giddy quadruple talk can get out of hand in relation to b) how really, really hard it actually is to do. When they lifted the Carabao, though, Liverpool did boast realistic hopes in all other competitions. They were favourites to win the Europa League but didn’t make it through another round. They were certainly favourites to beat Manchester United and reach the FA Cup semi-finals. And they were bang in the title race with Manchester City and Arsenal right up until they weren’t.",

      "So easily were Liverpool easing to the title that it didn’t take long for quadruple talk to bubble up. And, to be fair, what ultimately looks like they were nowhere near was not perhaps as far off as it ends up looking in raw numbers that read one single solitary trophy.",
      "The dream died in the most unlikely fashion, with an FA Cup fourth-round defeat for a much-changed team at Championship basement-dwellers Plymouth. Given everything else Liverpool were going for, and the nature of the opposition, you can understand the gamble even if it backfired miserably.",
      "After that, Liverpool would memorably go on to lose rather meekly to Newcastle in the Carabao final, while their reward for topping the league stage of the Champions League was a last-16 clash with PSG, which has to be considered sub-optimal.",
      "Somehow – to this day nobody really knows how – Liverpool emerged with a 1-0 win from a fearful battering in Paris but then lost by the same scoreline at Anfield before going out on penalties. It was as close as anyone came to halting PSG’s march in the knockout stages as Aston Villa, Arsenal and then most emphatically Inter were all dispatched. Liverpool would have very much fancied their chances of doing likewise had those spot-kicks gone differently."

      "But the main thing with Kamara is: our record with him vs without is pretty stark. The last time we lost a prem game with him in the team was Liverpool away on 1 November; otherwise, with him in the team we’ve played 6 other games against Big 6 teams and won 6. (And Wolves, which may not seem much but it has been hard work for us over the years, including this season until Bouba banged in a Rogers special).",
      "The last 3 league games he missed were Everton last weekend, Arsenal in December and Palace in August – we lost all 3 by an aggregate score of 8-1, even with the easier 2 games being at home. And the only cup games we’ve lost – Brentford in the Carabao and GAE in the Eurovision – were Kamara-free as well. So the fact that he will miss *every* game for the rest of the season has put the frighteners up all of us.\nNeil Raines",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games. Could do little to stop either of Sunderland’s goals.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves before a very creditable clean sheet at Villa.",
      "",
      "Burnley are in the mire but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 22 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo. And dropped a bollock against Everton.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad. Little he could do in the face of Carrick-ball.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal. A first clean sheet in five against Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4. And flapping at the corner that led to West Ham’s winner was a dreadful look.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and had very little to do against Palace and Wolves either side of a madness against Leeds.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so but Big John fluffed his big chance.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save at Fulham and only one against Burnley from his own defender.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri was back in. Briefly, as it turned out. Darlow took the gloves again for a serene outing against Fulham.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Unsurprisingly dropped when Fulham came to Elland Road.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save. Newcastle gave him little more to do.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he? It has been a rotten few weeks for the Cherries keeper.",

      "Andy Robertson to Spurs would have topped this lot, but there have still been five pretty strange deals in this January transfer window…",
      "The Mailbox can’t see a way back for Liverpool boss Arne Slot or Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank after their latest poor results in the Premier League.",

      "We could (quite fairly) be accused of erring on the side of negativity here at Football365. We revel in the rubbish and are often guilty of failing to bask in the brilliance we see on a regular basis in the Premier League.",
      "We’ve selected the most overrated players, the very worst player at each club and enjoy calling out big-money signings for an entirely reasonable struggle to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "But sometimes it’s nice to be nice, and so here are the revelations of the season, the players who have surprised us with their excellence – one per club.",
      "",
      "He must have been cursing his misfortune upon his arrival last season when Myles Lewis-Skelly enjoyed one of the most stratospheric rises to prominence in recent memory, to such a degree that Calafiori was linked with an exit in the summer, 12 months on from his arrival for £42m.",
      "But he’s made the left-back position in his own in the Premier League this term, combining near faultless defensive displays with no small amount of attacking threat. Being a big lad certainly hasn’t hurt him in his successful usurping of the academy star.",
      "",
      "An honourable mention for the Lazarus of the West Midlands, Matty Cash, who we thought was finished but has played nearly every minute under Unai Emery this term, scoring in the victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. But the new level Rogers has found this season gives him the edge; his knuckleball deserves its own section.",
      "Jude Bellingham or Rogers for England? Could genuinely be a toss-up.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ graded by football analysis experts Gradient Sports",
      "Seven Premier League goals in 646 minutes for the teenager, who’s got the best minutes per goal rate (92.3) of any player in the top flight this season, with Erling Haaland (95) second. The ‘New Kylian Mbappe’ tag doesn’t seem quite so silly now.",
      "",
      "Sixteen goals is at least 14 more goals than we expected from the £30m summer signing who scored 18 in what must actually be The Best League In The World for Club Brugge in 2023/24.",
      "",
      "His ability to thread passes through opposition teams is arguably unmatched in the Premier League and he also loves a battle with a centre-forward, as Haaland found out earlier this month. Quite weird that there’s not more interest in his service from the Big Six vultures. Surely only a matter of time.",
      "",
      "Eight goals in the Championship last season, Anthony’s already got five in the Premier League, including home and away against Manchester United and at the Etihad vs Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Him being fit is a revelation in itself but the way in which he’s developed as a central midfielder has also been remarkable. That move from right-back – which we questioned like many others – may end up being Enzo Maresca’s most crucial and enduring Chelsea legacy. His performance against Arsenal in that role was extraordinary.",
      "",
      "His level has dropped along with the rest of his teammates of late, but the 29-year-old put in several hugely impressive all-round displays when it was still worth getting up in the morning at Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Few would have predicted Garner as Xavi Simons’ answer to a question about which Premier League player has surprised him most – “technical with the ball, he’s really, really good” – or that midway through the season we would be seeing a (bit of a) clamour for him to be called up by Thomas Tuchel for England amid questions as to whether Manchester United should re-sign him as an answer to the midfield conundrum.",
      "",
      "Surely the biggest Premier League revelation of all with his eight goals and five assists for Fulham. And he so very nearly made a deadline-day move to Leeds – a private jet was pre-emptively booked before talks broke down.",

      "Nine Premier League goals, eight of which have come in a run of nine games after Daniel Farke changed formation to stick another striker up top with him. The England clamour is real.",
      "",
      "Slim picking it’s fair to say but 12 goals in all competitions is a decent return for a striker most of us assumed wouldn’t get much of a look in this season.",
      "",
      "We assumed he was destined to be one of those ten-a-penny wingers who get close to the top by being very, very quick but not quite having it in the top two inches, but he’s developed his game to the point where he doesn’t just look like he could and should make the difference but actually does.",
      "",
      "There’s life in the old dog yet as this particular old dog is evidently desperate to represent his country at the World Cup, before seeing out his days lying balls-up on the sofa, only rising from his slumber for meals and to curl the occasional one out in the back garden, probably in Saudi Arabia.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe described Kieran Trippier’s “spontaneous” decision to hand Miley the armband for the final few minutes of their clash with PSV on Wednesday as “poignant” and also quite possibly a sign of what’s to come, dubbing the 19-year-old a “potential future captain of the football club”.",
      "There was a time – maybe even only a few weeks ago – when an injury to Bruno Guimaraes would have been an utter disaster for Newcastle. But the outstanding versatility and quality shown by Miley this season makes his absence feel manageable at the very least.",
      "",
      "You pal down the pub claiming they always knew Anderson would emerge as the answer to that age-old England problem is almost certainly telling porky pies. His Transfermarkt valuation has nearly doubled from £28m to £52m this season and that’s likely around half of what Manchester City will pay for his services after he conducts England to World Cup glory in the summer.",
      "",
      "There are few things we like more than a Premier League giant selling an academy star to a lower-league team before they return to the top flight to rub the mistake in their face. It’s a shame for us vengeance seekers that Ballard’s boyhood club Arsenal might be the only Premier League side he wouldn’t start for based on his outstanding form this season.",
      "",
      "He does next-to-nothing to help his side keep hold of the ball or get up the pitch, which is entirely as expected, but has also scored seven Premier League goals when we assumed he would be fortunate to score any as a bit-part player before escaping in January.",
      "",
      "We liked what we saw of him for Southampton last season, but it takes quite some mental fortitude not to crumble in this West Ham team, playing in that stadium, in front of those fans. Two relegations in two seasons won’t feel great, but Real Madrid interest in triggering his not-so-secret £20m release clause will.",
      "",
      "The only positive Wolves can take away from this season and the fans will if anything not want him to display too much more of his burgeoning talent for the rest of the campaign, lest he be pinched by a club set to still be playing Premier League football next term.",
      "Pundit Danny Murphy has explained why he thinks only one team is capable of stopping Arsenal winning the Champions League this season.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid have issued an ‘ultimatum’ to Vinicius Junior, while president Florentino Perez ‘wants’ to sign a Manchester City star.",

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha scored a sensational 87th-minute winner to clinch a 3-2 victory for Michael Carrick's Manchester United and cut Arsenal's lead at the top of the Premier League to four points.",
      "Substitute Cunha curled a stunning finish into the corner from 25 yards out, only three minutes after Mikel Merino had hauled the lacklustre hosts level from a Bukayo Saka corner.",
      "Earlier, Arsenal had squandered a lead when Martin Zubimendi's poor pass allowed Bryan Mbeumo to run through on goal and beat David Raya after Lisandro Martinez had diverted Martin Odegaard's cross-shot into his own net for the opening goal.",
      "Arsenal struggled to regain their composure after Mbeumo's leveller and Manchester United, 2-0 winners over Manchester City in Carrick's first game in charge last weekend, went in front when Patrick Dorgu crashed a superb effort in off the bar.",
      "Arsenal: Raya (6), Timber (6), Gabriel (6), Saliba (6), Hincapie (6), Zubimendi (5), Rice (6), Odegaard (6), Saka (6), Trossard (6), Jesus (5)\n\n\nSubs: White (6), Eze (6), Merino (7), Gyokeres (6), Madueke (6)\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (7), Maguire (8), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Amad (7), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (8), Mbeumo (8)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (8), Sesko (n/a), Mazraoui (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Harry Maguire",
      "Mikel Arteta tried to change the flow of the game by making a quadruple substitution before the hour mark, but Arsenal continued to flounder before finally restoring parity when Merino prodded over the line for yet another set-piece goal.",
      "At that point, it seemed Arsenal might go on and find a winner, but Cunha silenced the Emirates Stadium when his stunning, long-range effort sparked more wild Manchester United celebrations. There were boos from some home fans at the final whistle.",
      "The victory continues a dream start in the dugout for head coach Carrick, and leaves alarm bells ringing for Arsenal, whose lead at the top of the Premier League is reduced from seven to four points following Manchester City and Aston Villa's wins.",
      "Having been held to goalless draws against Nottingham Forest and Liverpool in their previous two Premier League games, Arsenal are now without a win in three as Manchester United continue to push for a Champions League finish in fourth.",
      "Former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira felt his former side showed a lack of mental strength.",
      "\"It's not just that they lost the game, it's the way they lost the game. Saka and Trossard didn't produce enough to worry United.",
      "\"They need a leader to lift the spirit of the team. They need to understand when they are on the pitch they have to play with more energy and more risks. They have the quality.",
      "\"They didn't play with the freedom to express themselves.\"",

      "\"A very painful one but it's time to be close to the players who gave us great moments. We all want to win.",
      "\"We have to learn from it. Defeats are part of winning, and we have to take them like this, because they need to be reminded how good they are.\"",
      "\"It wasn't good enough from us. We need some time to analyse it now but it was not good enough, the performance. We should have done better but now is the time to stick together even more and keep working, be together, and bounce back.",
      "\"In the first half, we were the better team, scored the goal and had control of the game but we had a lot of giveaways in the game that created dangerous moments and in the second half the game changed a little bit.",
      "\"We know the quality they have when they get the space to run. In the second half, there were a lot of duels they won that gave them the momentum of the game and let them run and we never really managed to get into that rhythm of creating chances.",
      "\"It was never going to be easy in this league, we know that. Now is the time to be strong. We are still top of the league so we have to keep going and bounce back straight away.\"",
      "\"Massively proud. I think it was different from last week. It was always going to be different today. They put us under a lot of pressure in different ways.",
      "\"We probably didn't have as much genuine, regular threat within the game as we did last week, but I thought there were periods when we looked really dangerous.",
      "\"To come here and score three goals in the manner we did, going one down, coming back, then the setback, and still keeping going - it was a huge moment for us.",
      "\"The boys had to put an awful lot in today. It probably didn't come as easy as it did last week. Last week, the time, the flow of the game and the momentum was with us pretty much throughout, whereas today we had to dig deep.",
      "\"It was a massive effort and I'm really proud of them.\"",
      "\"It's absolutely massive. We know the first game under Michael Carrick was the Manchester derby at Old Trafford. You always get up for those games and results like that can happen. But we knew we had to back it up today.",
      "\"We spoke about it before the game, coming here to face the league leaders, who have been excellent this season. They ask a lot of questions of you, and to go and get the winner after a late setback shows the character of this team. It was a magnificent performance.\"",

Bruno Fernandes had spurned an excellent chance moments earlier too. Arsenal cannot say they weren't warned, in other words.",

      "He boldly threw on Benjamin Sesko as the injured Patrick Dorgu's replacement late on at the Emirates with the score at 2-1, when it would have been easy to opt for the industrious Mason Mount to help Luke Shaw stifle Bukayo Saka.",
      "Sesko went down the middle and the attack-minded Matheus Cunha was shifted to the left, with his winning goal coming from when he was able to drift into space before curling in.",
      "\"We're not getting carried away,\" said Carrick, but some Man Utd fans left the Emirates singing \"we're going to win the league\". They now sit inside the top four and while a title challenge is most unlikely, securing a Champions League spot is much more achievable.",

      "Right now, Konsa is playing with authority, composure and a footballing brain that elevates those around him.",

      "They've picked up two points in the league across that run and scored only three goals, while shipping 18.",

      "The hosts had two gilt-edged chances before half-time, attempted 35 crosses but only forced Matz Sels into one real save across 90 minutes at the Gtech. They faced a Forest side playing peak Sean Dyche football for much of the game, but one they played into the hands of.",
      "Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will head and kick everything away all day. Brentford did not move Forest around enough, and on the rare occasion they did manufacture something from a clever pass they nearly scored.",
      "The timing of the visitors' two goals, book-ending the game as they did, could not have been much better and showed up a Brentford attack which laboured but had few ideas to combat the visitors' low block.",
      "Brentford will not face Dyche every week. But losing Mikkel Damsgaard to a suspected knee injury will not aid their cause given a lack of real creative alternatives in midfield. Keith Andrews himself said it had been a delight to watch the Danish midfielder play - and he will hope more than anyone that his diagnosis is not serious.Ron Walker",
      "Newcastle's summer recruitment in forward areas was meant to soften the blow of life without Alexander Isak. Instead, it's starting to underline just how hard he is to replace.",
      "The 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa felt like a case study in attacking shortfall. Plenty of effort, plenty of running but very little incision. When the game needed a spark, Eddie Howe turned to his bench and got no real lift.",
      "Jacob Ramsey, Anthony Elanga and Nick Woltemade - a combined cost of £175m - were all given opportunities but the game passed them by. Ramsey looked lost, Elanga's pace never translated into end product and Woltemade looked isolated against Villa's centre-backs.",
      "Meanwhile, Yoane Wissa, another summer recruit, couldn't find space to threaten from the start.",
      "This is where Isak's absence looms large. He doesn't just score goals, his movement and intelligence won Newcastle games. Without him, the attack looks flatter, easier to contain and more predictable.",
      "Recruitment is always judged over time, but right now the early evidence suggests Newcastle haven't found the right blend to cover for Isak's unique profile.Lewis Jones",
      "Joao Pedro was the player of the match at Crystal Palace but Estevao continues to excite. The 18-year-old Brazilian became the youngest Chelsea player to score and assist in the same Premier League match since Neil Shipperley in 1993. Different times.",
      "His goal in the 3-1 win was superb, showing not just pace but skill and strength to hold off a quality defender in Tyrick Mitchell. The finish was emphatic, ramming the ball beyond Dean Henderson. No wonder Chelsea supporters want to see more of him.",
      "This was Estevao's first goal since the win over Barcelona in November, although Chelsea as a whole have been a little out of sorts since then. This was a first Premier League away win since beating Burnley that month, ending a run of five without a win.",
      "There are a plethora of options for Liam Rosenior in the attacking positions at Chelsea. That, coupled with some fitness issues, has led to Estevao making more of his appearances off the bench than from the start since losing to Leeds in early December.",
      "But Estevao's potential far outstrips that of his peers in Chelsea blue - not just for the future but the here and now. No player has scored more goals for the club at the same age during the Premier League era. His impact at Selhurst Park feels like just the start.Adam Bate",

      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick is relishing the opportunity for his side to prove themselves against league leaders Arsenal after a dream start at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick, who is in interim charge of United until the end of the season, got off to a winning start as he led his side to a 2-0 derby day win at Old Trafford. It was a performance that earned plaudits for a dominant attacking display.",
      "The former United midfielder is preparing his side for another test against an Arsenal side that are in the driving seat to end a 22-year wait for a Premier League title.",
      "United travel to the Emirates, where the Gunners haven't lost a single game at the Emirates this season, searching for a first Premier League win at Arsenal since 2017.",
      "However, Carrick may take some added confidence given the fact that when he last took on Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, the 44-year-old guided United to a 3-2 victory in 2021, while in caretaker charge.",
      "\"I think Mikel's done a really good job assembling a team that can do so many things well. That in itself is a challenge.",
      "\"The wide men are dangerous one-vs-one. They fill the box and they get a good balance within the team, how they attack, how they defend.",
      "\"They're all a team and they all play their part. It's not necessarily one individual who carries them. Again, from a coaching point of view, credit to Mikel for that.",
      "\"Set plays, they're a threat as well. That's why they're sitting at the top of the league and that's why they're doing so well at the moment in the Champions League.",
      "\"The feeling we've taken over the last week or two in the game and the training, The boys feel in a good place and are looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It's a challenge, we know that, but we can go there and we can face it head-on. We've got good players and we're a good team as well, so we've just proved that. We need to keep proving it as we go.\"",
      "Recalling the win over Arteta's Arsenal in 2021, Carrick added: \"There's not much to take from that moving into this one. It's a whole new challenge, a whole new game, a whole new group of players. More feeding off what we've done this week, going into the game and looking forward to it.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta expects Manchester United to bring \"intensity\" and \"new ideas\" under Carrick as Arsenal aim to get back to winning ways following goalless draws against Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Arsenal boss is especially wary of their counter-attacking threat having watched them ruthlessly punish Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in last weekend's Manchester derby.",
      "\"Michael coming in will bring new ideas,\" he said. \"Always, the intensity rises up.",
      "\"You could see that in the Manchester derby, the kind of behaviours and the game that they played, so we will expect a really tough match and we'll adapt to that for sure.",
      "\"But we are at home and we know how important that game is for us.",
      "\"They are so good in a lot of departments, but it is clear that when that team has a space to go in a certain place to activate or run, they become lethal.",
      "\"You saw that a few days ago in Manchester. They have a lot of attributes to cause you problems. But as well, like every team, they have their weaknesses as well.",
      "\"Historically, there has always been something very linked to that,\" he added of their counter-attacking threat. \"And the profile of players that they always have and certain individuals that are so good at activating those spaces as well.",
      "\"I don't know the stats exactly, but for sure, they are one of the best.\"",
      "Arteta also recalled his meetings with Carrick as a player. \"One of my favourite No 6s,\" he said. \"Very intelligent, looked like he could never break sweat, he was so in control of the games.\"",
      "Of their previous meeting as coaches, Arsenal's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford in December 2021, Arteta added: \"Not great memories, so we have to change them.\"",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United in the summer. His estimated cost to the club £119m. The Athletic asks whether he was worth it",
      "By Mark Critchley, The Athletic",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 18:41, UK",
      "Spending at least £60m in transfer fees on a 30-year-old, giving him a salary of up to £350,000-per-week, and signing him to a four-year contract with the option of a further 12 months would not typically be viewed as cost-effective business.",
      "That is at least partly why Manchester United will not be triggering said option in Casemiro's contract. His Old Trafford career will instead come to an end this summer, as had long been expected.",
      "Once he says goodbye, after adding to his 146 appearances, many will hold up Casemiro's time in Manchester as another symbol of United's waste and extravagance in the transfer market, and a starry-eyed infatuation with big-name, big-money players who arrive well past their peak.",
      "There is undoubtedly some truth to that, but even if he may not have been a particularly smart signing, Casemiro was arguably a necessary one. And though four seasons of a five-time Champions League winner was never going to come cheap, it would also be unfair to dismiss him as a costly mistake.",
      "If anything, the cost was a symptom of United's desperation and dysfunction during Erik ten Hag's tumultuous first summer in charge, with his signing from Real Madrid being quickly accelerated after back-to-back defeats in their opening Premier League games.",
      "The long, protracted and painful pursuit of Frenkie de Jong had run aground by that point. Champions League qualification needed to be delivered at all costs.",
      "Ultimately, it was, thanks in no small part to Casemiro. For that first year in Manchester, certainly for the first six months of his Old Trafford career, he was considered a transformative addition.",
      "The arrival of one of the best No 6s of his generation finally addressed a longstanding problem at the base of midfield. Even if his age meant he was not going to be a long-term solution, his quality and experience meant he was a quick, effective fix.",
      "At his best for United, around the time of the Carabao Cup final victory over Newcastle United that February, he was being uncontroversially hailed in some quarters as the club's most important signing since Eric Cantona.",
      "Casemiro's second season was much more of a struggle, though, and has coloured perceptions of his United career away from Old Trafford. On several occasions, he no longer looked capable of keeping up with the pace of the Premier League, and those stuck in the craw.",
      "Though far from the only player to have difficulties meeting the demands of Ten Hag's increasingly helter-skelter style of play, it did him absolutely no favours as a holding midfielder on the wrong side of 30 and exposed the short-termism of his signing.",
      "He didn't, though. And even after being cast to the peripheries by Ten Hag's successor, at one stage finding himself behind a 21-year-old Toby Collyer in the pecking order, his dedication and determination to win back his place led him to practically become an ever-present again. From then on, he was an example Ruben Amorim would constantly tell his other players to follow.",
      "Last week, The Athletic revealed that Casemiro's option would be automatically triggered if he started every remaining game this season. The chances of that were remote. Even if United had been open to another year, even if their shrinking budgets could afford it, injury or suspension would likely have got in the way. But on form alone, it was not such an outlandish prospect.",
      "Casemiro has started 19 of 24 matches in all competitions this season, including all but one of the Premier League games that he has been available for. Despite the justified clamour for Kobbie Mainoo to be given more opportunities, few argued that should come at the 33-year-old's expense.",
      "When part of more compact and conservative tactical setups than Ten Hag's, he has generally looked capable of continuing to play at a high level.",
      "His considerable threat from set pieces has left him with a respectable tally of 21 goals since joining. And though he could be erratic with his passing, there were often nights over the past three and a half years when he looked like the only United player other than Bruno Fernandes capable of creating something.",
      "Thursday's announcement that he will leave at the end of the season followed a man-of-the-match display in the 198th Manchester derby. It was only the latest example that Casemiro still has something to offer United, albeit not on his current pay packet.",
      "Even without the one-year option triggered, a rough estimate puts the minimum cost to United of first signing and then keeping Casemiro for the past four seasons at £119m ($160m). Was it worth it? Opinions will vary.",
      "But here's something more of us can agree on: United have been a better team when Casemiro is playing. This season, especially. And now, he must be replaced.",
      "There is a different set of decision-makers in place at Old Trafford compared to the summer of 2022, and they will surely look for a younger and more athletic midfielder, with a higher ceiling in terms of what they can achieve as a United player, and a higher resale value if they fall short of that mark. A smarter signing, we'll all surely agree.",
      "Like Casemiro, that midfielder - whether it is Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or another target - won't come cheap. And to avoid any sort of drop-off next season, they will need to be as dependable at the base of United's midfield as the man they are replacing has been for most of his eventful Old Trafford career.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has 18 months remaining on his Manchester United contract, plus the option of a further year; 20-year-old did not start a Premier League game this season under Ruben Amorim but was restored to the XI in Michael Carrick's first game",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 11:58, UK",
      "On the day when United confirmed that one key midfielder will leave Old Trafford, with the soon-to-be-34-year-old Casemiro departing at the end of this season, it can now be revealed they are keen to tie down another, much younger, midfielder with a vastly improved deal.",
      "It is understood there has been initial contact with Mainoo's representatives, with a plan to sit down and discuss the details of a new and improved contract - one which would see his wages brought more in line with his team-mates and his standing at the club.",
      "Having come through United's academy, Mainoo's salary is among the smallest of all the members of the first-team squad. But with the 20-year-old not part of former head coach Ruben Amorim's plans, and with 18 months remaining on his current deal - plus a further year option - it was not seen as a priority for the club to open fresh talks.",
      "Mainoo did not start a single Premier League match this season under Amorim but was selected at the first opportunity by new head coach Michael Carrick last weekend as he put in an impressive performance as United beat City 2-0 in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"It's a significant time.",
      "\"On the day Manchester United announce Casemiro will be leaving the club at the end of the season, the club want to tie down another, much younger player in Mainoo, who they see as a key player for the future.",
      "\"It's a significant change for Mainoo.",
      "\"Under previous coach Ruben Amorim, he didn't start a single game this season.",
      "\"There was also interest in him in Europe but Michael Carrick has come in and he starred in the win over Manchester City.",
      "\"Manchester United now feel that this is the right time, while they are putting their house in order, they want to tie down some of their younger players who are important to the club's future. Mainoo is at the heart of it.\"",
      "The Mainoo news comes as Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season, ending a four-year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "As SSN previously reported in the autumn, Casemiro is one of the highest earners in the squad and it was unlikely United would renew his contract as the freed up wage capacity will allow more space for future investment/signings in the midfield area.",
      "Casemiro has had a renaissance at the club in the last 12 months. After being out of the team under Ruben Amorim initially, he was praised by Amorim for his willingness to fight for his place and has been a key part of the team since then - he started the Manchester derby under Michael Carrick in his first game as well.",
      "Looking ahead to the summer, Manchester United have an interest in the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.",
      "\"It's very interesting because we knew Casemiro's contract was running out this summer.",
      "\"Harry Maguire is also someone to talk about because his contract also runs out this summer. No fresh talks have happened with him, either.",
      "\"But especially with Casimiro, he is one of the highest earners at the club, and with that freed up wage space, we've been reporting in not just this window how Manchester United are targeting the summer to reinforce their midfield.",
      "\"We've already talked about the likes of Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace, Carlos Baleba at Brighton, Elliot Anderson and Nottingham Forest, to name a few.",
      "\"And through INEOS taking really control of the football operations, they've tried to change the way structures are streamlined a lot more.",
      "\"They're hoping that all of this capacity freed up can allow for more signings in the future, and with the midfield as a priority, it will mean that they definitely have to now sign someone in the summer.",
      "\"They'll only have Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, who looks like a new player under Michael Carrick, based on the Manchester derby.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes, now moving to No 10, they won't have many options in that position. INEOS will have to act quickly.\"",
