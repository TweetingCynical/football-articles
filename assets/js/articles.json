      "Newcastle United could solve Alexander Isak's transfer standoff by agreeing to sell him next summer once they've found a replacement, says former Premier League defender Chris Powell. The Swedish striker made his intentions to quit Tyneside known back in July and has since attracted a jaw-dropping £110million offer from reigning champions Liverpool.",
      "But the Magpies rate their star man much higher, leaving negotiations at a complete deadlock at St. James' Park. Isak has made it abundantly clear he won't pull on a Newcastle shirt this season as he pushes for his dream switch to Anfield, though with no improved offer on the table, the situation is becoming increasingly toxic.",
      "Powell, who featured in the top flight for Derby County, Charlton and Watford before moving into management, thinks there's still a way forward and believes the club could throw Isak a lifeline by promising to cash in on him in 12 months once they've lined up a proper replacement.",
      "\"There is a way back for Newcastle if they say to Isak, 'Give us a year,'\" said Powell, Footy Accumulators No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, in partnership with BOYLE Sports.",
      "\"We've seen it before with (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Sir Alex Ferguson) Fergie, give him a year and he can go next summer. That gives them time to get a replacement.",
      "\"At the moment, they've missed out on (Benjamin) Sesko, (Bryan) Mbeumo, one or two others, they can't get a replacement now. All of a sudden, they might panic and get players they don't necessarily want.\"",
      "Newcastle have had two record-breaking bids for strikers rejected this summer, including a £70m offer for Hugo Ekitike that was turned down, reports Chronicle Live.",
      "Liverpool managed to secure the signing of Frankfurt's French striker in a £79m deal, and shortly after, another target, Benjamin Sesko, also eluded them.",
      "The Magpies made two offers for RB Leipzig forward, with the second bid escalating to £75m. Despite Newcastle's more lucrative offer, Manchester United ended up securing his services.",
      "Howe's side missed yet another opportunity to replace the 25-year-old, leaving Isak in a state of uncertainty. He is currently training separately from his Newcastle colleagues.",
      "Powell has suggested that the club should reach a compromise with Isak, convincing him to stay for another year before guaranteeing his departure next summer when a new striker can be signed without any rush. However, the 55-year-old concedes that Isak's move to Liverpool in the future is inevitable, despite the club's insistence that he is not for sale.",
      "\"I think Isak's going to Liverpool. For him to do that and express his desire to leave, he's going,\" continued Powell, who last coached Sheffield Wednesday, a position he left in July.",
      "\"They're not going to keep him and tell him he's in the reserves. You can't do that anymore, those days are over. He's going to Liverpool. And if Liverpool gets him, that's it. The league is over.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim wants to bolster his midfield after spending £200million on his frontline but is having to consider his options with the Seagulls playing hardball over their Cameroon midfielder - which has led to United's interest in Hjulmand.",
      "The Dane would be available for £50m, which is notably less than his £68m release clause. The Portuguese side would be willing to accept a lower fee if the necessary add-ons were met, reports The Sun. The 26-year-old has been a massive hit since signing from Lecce for just £15m in 2023.",
      "It was Amorim who bought Hjulmand to the Portuguese capital and he's known to be a fan of his leadership qualities. The midfielder is also fully embedded in how to play in the 3-4-3 system that the United manager has been implementing.",
      "Baleba remains the first choice target in Manchester but Brighton want more than £100m before they part with their player, making Hjulmand a far cheaper alternative at a time when cash is not freely available for the Premier League side.",
      "Hjulmand played 65 times during his spell together with Amorim at Sporting - winning two Primeira Liga titles and a Taca de Portugal. The Dane scored his first goal of the season as he helped Sporting secure a 2-0 league opening win over Casa Pia on Friday.",
      "The cash United would save from signing Hjulmand as opposed to Baleba would also potentially leave money left over, which would be used to pursue a new goalkeeper. Gianluigi Donnarumma is on the market but the Red Devils need to act quick with Manchester City circling.",
      "Amorim is still to be convinced by Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro in pre-season, while Kobbie Mainoo still needs to impress with manager with the Portuguese boss admitting publicly where his game is short.",
      "Brighton are poised to be a tough but to crack though with their chief executive Paul Barber making it clear they don't want to part with their top names, especially having already seen Joao Pedro leave for Chelsea.",
      "He said: \"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.\"",

      "Steve McManaman believes Marcus Rashford has no place at Barcelona despite his sensational loan move. The Manchester United forward finally sealed a move away from Old Trafford last month as he moved to Catalonia for the forthcoming season.",
      "The switch sees him move on loan, albeit Barcelona have an option to make the move permanent next summer for around £30m. But Rashford has had a slow start to life in Spain.",
      "Barcelona are still struggling to register him for this season’s La Liga opener due to their uncertain financial situation. And Liverpool icon McManaman struggles to see Rashford getting an opportunity given the options that the club already have.",
      "“It's certainly important that he hits the ground running,” he said at an event with ESPN. “I thought it was an incredible move for him, to be very honest.",
      "“The last couple of seasons at Manchester United, the way Manchester United performed - for him to leave and go to arguably one of the most exciting teams in Europe, I thought: 'He's got an amazing agent.'",
      "“Where's he going to fit in? The answer is, I don't know. Because Raphinha, Robert [Lewandowski] and Lamine [Yamal], they had the most incredible season.",
      "“So you think that is set in stone. You've got Ferran [Torres] behind them. They've moved a couple of players out - if anything, when you look at Barcelona's team, they need a couple of more defenders... but they go and bring in yet another forward. So we'll wait and see.”",
      "McManaman added: “I hope he's a huge success, and I hope he does play. Because it will benefit everybody if he does play.”",
      "Barcelona are just a day from starting their latest La Liga season as they travel to Mallorca on Saturday evening. As it stands, Rashford’s registration has still not been approved.",
      "But it appears that the Spanish giants are set to take emergency action to ensure that he can play sooner rather than later. According to The Athletic, Barcelona executives would be willing to put their own personal wealth at risk to secure a bank guarantee worth around €7million (£6m).",
      "Rashford is not the only player who is not eligible to play though. Goalkeepers Joan Garcia and Wojciech Szczesny, as well as young defender Gerard Martin, are still not registered.",
      "Rashford will certainly be keen to get back on the pitch sooner rather than later having scored four goals in 17 appearances on loan at Aston Villa last season, albeit the Premier League side chose not to sign him permanently.",

      "Bruno Fernandes admits it \"doesn't fill me with pride\" that he gets lauded whilst playing in a failing Manchester United side - and would much rather play a lesser role to see the team succeed.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker enjoyed another stellar campaign on an individual basis, but did so whilst the Red Devils endured their lowest ever Premier League finish. Their dire campaign was their worst since the mid 1970s and saw them end up in 15th.",
      "Fernandes' solo stats still made for impressive reading and he was often left to carry the struggling outfit. He scored 19 goals in all competitions and was nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award alongside the likes of Mohamed Salah and Cole Palmer.",
      "The 30-year-old's influence was such that Jeff Stelling remarked that they'd be fighting to remain a top flight team minus him. “Without Bruno Fernandes this season, Manchester United would be battling to stay out of the bottom three,” he said in April.",
      "Despite being hailed for his individual contributions Fernandes takes no solace from those reviews and would rather see his role and importance reduce if it meant the team were on the up.",
      "He told ESPN Brazil: \"I hope you'll hear less about Bruno this year, but a lot more about United. That's my main objective because my name being spoken, let's say vaguely alone, It doesn't fill me with pride or anything.",
      "\"United being talked about, being positive, that's the most important thing and that's what I want for this season. If it happens that Bruno has to score fewer goals, provide less assists or do another type of provision of what is necessary for the games, I would be very happy.\"",
      "There is likely to be less of a reliance on Fernandes to contribute in the final third. The playmaker has been joined by more than £200million worth of talent in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and is confident that the right moves are being taken.",
      "He added: \"Now people have joined the club, not just the players, but also staff and management, who have a different vision. I hope that all these changes and everything that we have done can bring the club back to the place where it really deserves to be.\"",

      "If history is anything to go by don't necessarily expect the Premier League's first weekend to produce the results you expect - in fact the first set of fixtures are littered with shock results.",
      "Some of those have been a sign of things to come, others may involve a new manager or a new look team just getting to grips with each other and on some occasions it is an early speed bump, but nothing that matters come crunch time in May.",
      "The opening set of games can be unkind - just ask Manchester United and Arsenal as they prepare to square off on Sunday. For others, like Liverpool at home to Bournemouth, there's an expectation they should get the job done with minimal fuss.",
      "Manchester City head to Wolves, which has not always been a happy hunting ground, whilst Chelsea host the Community Shield winners Crystal Palace. Tottenham's game with newly promoted Burnley is also one the north Londoners are expected to negotiate.",
      "But the early weeks of the season, often involving new players and new systems, can mean the status quo is thrown out. They can lead to knee jerk reactions, especially if transfer windows have not gone to plan.",
      "We take a look back at some of the opening weekend results that raised serious eyebrows - some situations that were recoverable and others that were the beginning of the end.",
      "The Erik ten Hag era did not begin well as Brighton, then led by Graham Potter, rocked up at Old Trafford and found themselves ahead by the half hour mark. By half-time it was 2-0 and the home fans were shell shocked as their new manager was being outclassed. United pulled a goal back to set up a nervy finish, but it wasn't to be as Cristiano Ronaldo was bought off the bench to try and be the saviour.",
      "Remember the name Reece Oxford? He produced the one and only standout game of his career as he bossed the midfield to give the Slaven Bilic era the perfect start. It was also the match where the Hammers realised they had a potential star in Dimitri Payet. Arsenal thought they'd got the missing piece of the jigsaw when they signed Petr Cech, only for him to make a notable error for one of the goals.",
      "Another forgettable afternoon at the Emirates to begin the season. Boos rang out at full-time as Arsene Wenger saw his side beaten with Antonio Luna among the scorers. Arsenal would react by signing Mesut Ozil and rebuilding their season impressively, but before the German arrived it was looking like a bleak season in north London.",
      "Like the aforementioned Ten Hag, this was another new era that did not begin as planned. One this occasion it was Louis van Gaal, the Champions League-winning manager, who was outdone by Garry Monk. Wayne Rooney cancelled out Swansea's opening goal and it was set-up for the Red Devils to come from behind and pick up the three points - but Gylfi Sigurdsson had other ideas will the game's winner.",
      "The Blues hoped to build on a record-breaking title success under Antonio Conte, but that summer was marred by the club consistently failing to get the Italian's targets over the line. So come the first game of the season, against Sean Dyche's Burnley, the feeling was not positive and when the Clarets raced into a 3-0 lead the clouds were gathering over Stamford Bridge. A late fightback made the result look better, but it was not the start anyone wanted.",
      "An iconic scene as Premier League matches welcomed back full stadiums for the Bees' top flight debut. Their stadium was bouncing with Arsenal coming to town and the newly promoted side produced a streetwise performance to down Mikel Arteta's side - who would embark on a forgettable opening few weeks before they mounted a recovery. But not before there was calls for the manager to be axed.",
      "On the face of it, not an outstanding shock. But on paper this was a newly promoted side, who had just seen their manager leave his role, downing the Premier League champions. Leicester were out to prove that their 5,000/1 miracle was no fluke, but their difficult season began in Hull with a late defeat.",

      "Peter Crouch is backing Benjamin Sesko to hit the ground running in the Premier League. Sesko has joined Manchester United in a £74m deal from RB Leipzig and will play alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a new-look £200m attack.",
      "“But out of the new faces, Sesko is the one that I like watching. I’m excited by him. There’s still the fact that he hasn’t played in the Premier League and that is something that you have to look at.",
      "“Can he settle straight away? But he’s the player that excites me the most out of the new signings.”",
      "Sesko has landed at Old Trafford after Arsenal opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon instead. The Gunners paid £64m for the ex-Coventry man, who netted a staggering 54 times in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "Gyokeres was considered by Ruben Amorim for a reunion at United, but will instead work under Mikel Arteta this season. Arsenal scouted Sesko heavily over the past few seasons before going for Gyokeres, yet Crouch is more excited by the Slovenia international.",
      "“Obviously he’s a proven goal scorer. I know someone who worked with him when he was in England previously,” the ex-Liverpool striker said of Gyokeres ahead of United vs Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "“It was strange that he was let go. He went out to Sporting and banged in loads of goals and I’m sure he can do the same for Arsenal. But how quickly will he settle?",
      "“It strikes me that Sesko is the man to hit the ground running. You just never know. If he gets a couple of goals then he’ll be full of confidence, he could go on a mad run because he’s more than capable of it.”",
      "United have invested heavily at the top end of the pitch after managing a measly 44 goals in 38 games as they finished 15th last season. Alongside Sesko, they have gone for proven Premier League quality in the form of Cunha, who scored 15 times in the league for Wolves in 2024/25, and Mbeumo, who bagged 20 goals for Brentford.",
      "Crouch thinks that their new firepower can propel United well up the table this season. “There are some great signings,” he said. “But the forward line needed work, didn't it? It was misfiring all last season and Bruno Fernandes got them out of a real hole at times.",
      "“Cunha and Mbeumo – it’s not like they haven’t played in the Premier League, they were both brilliant and scored a lot of goals last season. And Sesko is a top player.",
      "“I think they will be a force. It was an awful year for them last year. I think there will be a huge improvement and they will finish in and around the top six.”",
      "Peter Crouch was speaking ahead of Paddy Power’s most generous start to a season ever. With Super Sub your bet carries on – even if the player you’ve bet on comes off, meaning even more chances to win. With more FREE Bet Builders than ever before, there’s nowhere better to place your punt.",

That was seen as the most favourable option before Fulham expressed their interest, but they want to know about the player's state of mind, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "United want to move on Hojlund, especially after landing Benjamin Sesko for more than £70m. The ex-Atalanta man has been unable to deliver consistently during his two years in Manchester, leading to them dipping into the market once again.",
      "The player though has expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place, even if Sesko's arrival will push him further down the pecking order.",
      "It is unlikely that Fulham will want a player who was forced out of Manchester and moved to them against his will, as a result they have enquired about his willingness to make the move.",
      "Hojlund was adamant that he relished the competition when he was quizzed on his future during United's pre-season tour of the United States. He said: “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",

      "Isak has claimed he will not play for Newcastle again and it is that stance that could see the 25-year-old in trouble. The star striker has so far continued to receive his £140,000-a-week wages amidst the stand-off.",
      "The Daily Mail report Newcastle's stance will change once Isak misses a competitive match and discipline will then arrive.",

      "Man United may have finally found a route out of Old Trafford for Jadon Sancho but it will come at significant cost. Serie A giants Roma have launched a £20m bid for the England international — a figure more than £50m short of what they paid for the winger in 2021.",
      "United have already been forced to admit they will sell Sancho for less than £25m this summer, while Roma could also be interested in a loan deal, per BBC.",
      "That would contain clauses to be triggered at the end of the season but is complicated by Sancho's contract situation. The Red Devils have an option to extend the star's deal by a further year but his significant salary places some doubt over whether United would be willing to action such a move.",
      "Fulham are ready to enter the race for Rasmus Hojlund but want assurances that the Man United striker has an interest in joining them with the Dane previously expressing a desire to remain where he is.",
      "The west Londoners are weighing up a move for the forward as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject of bids from Atalanta, which could leave them light in the final third. Those at Old Trafford are open to Hojlund's exit and are currently looking for a suitor.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United regarding the striker and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. That was seen as the most favourable option before Fulham expressed their interest, but they want to know about the player's state of mind, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "The Evening Standard reports that Spurs have held talks for Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze and Manchester City winger Savinho in recent days with their manager making it clear he wants more arrivals.",
      "“We do work very hard to see if we can do that. In general, I’m very happy with the squad, but of course, in every window, you’d like to see if you can make the squad stronger before the window closes. That’s what we’re working hard on.”",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot admits they need \"one more attacker at least\" as the club continue to go after Alexander Isak with their pursuit showing no sign of cooling.",
      "The Reds spent £79m to land Hugo Ekitike from Frankfurt, the Frenchman scoring on his debut, but Slot wants more and has opened the door to his new signing pushing out wide to accommodate another new arrival.",
      "Eddie Howe has confessed that Newcastle are having to accept that they may have to work with the squad they've been left with - which is one that doesn't include Alexander Isak as he addressed the saga once again.",
      "\"I don't think it's been healthy for us,\" he said. \"I don't deny that's been a big challenge. Alex, for me, is one of the best strikers in the world - if not the best. To miss him from your squad leaves a huge gap.\"",
      "He also added: \"I think morale was certainly affected early on during pre-season. There was nothing I could do to affect that - it was always going to be there.",
      "\"When you have a player that good who is not part of your group, it's difficult for the players to fully understand it and to know what's going on and how to react. But, as time has gone on, there has been an acceptance this is the squad and we have got to make the best of the situation.\"",

      "Complacent Premier League bosses have “no plans” to move any of their domestic fixtures abroad - and claim they have no need to export their brand. Spanish football will break new ground this season after Villarreal and Barcelona were given permission to play their LaLiga fixture in Miami on December 20.",
      "But Premier League chief executive Richard Masters insists English football won’t be following suit - even though clubs voted in favour of a 39th game back in 2008 and it was only binned after world governing body FIFA vetoed it.",
      "Masters said: “LaLiga have been very open about their desire to play matches abroad. The Spanish federation have approved it, but as far as the Premier League’s position is concerned, I’m very clear about it.",
      "“We don’t have plans to play matches abroad. It’s not being discussed around our table. The overall objective of playing matches abroad is to grow that league internationally - but we’re now a genuinely global league.",
      "“All of the data points suggest the Premier League is growing internationally without the need to play matches abroad. We have fantastic international broadcasting partnerships, we’ve got global digital services now for fans to interact with the game and, of course, we’re investing in other things like the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "“But I think playing matches domestically is where we’re going to stay.” Masters’ optimism that English football’s domestic calendar will remain confined to these shores may not be shared by Premier League clubs - more than half of whom have foreign owners.",
      "If a two-thirds majority - 14 top-flight clubs - decide they fancy playing abroad, Masters will be powerless to stop it. Eleven of this season’s Prem clubs are owned by American majority shareholders alone, and the States would be the No.1 choice for a game abroad, just as regular NBA basketball and NFL gridiron games are already played in London.",
      "Masters insisted: “There is no desire to discuss this at the moment. If La Liga want to do it, and it’s within the global framework of the game, then it’ll be a very interesting thing to observe. But number one, two and three: The Premier League does not have plans to do it.”",
      "In his pre-season briefing, Masters claimed the “lights on the dashboard are flashing green” to indicate the game’s rude health economically.",
      "The rising cost of attendance for match-going supporters, however, remains a huge bone of contention for diehard fans. Bournemouth fans face a 530-mile round trip through Friday traffic for tonight’s opening game at champions Liverpool.",
      "Adult tickets in the Holte end for Aston Villa ’s home game with Newcastle cost an eye-watering £77, while a full adult Chelsea replica kit will set fans back £148.",
      "But Masters said: “We fully understand the relationship between full stadiums being part of the show that goes around the world that makes English football special.",
      "“We’ve had a long period of flat ticket prices - some are going up, but eight clubs have frozen their prices this year, and we’re committed again to the £30 price cap for away fans. Although we can’t get involved in the pricing of kits, clubs do understand affordability.”",

      "The lengths Manchester United went to sign Benjamin Sesko have been revealed by the star's agent. Elvis Basanovic claims the Red Devils followed his every step to engage in talks across six different cities as they beat Newcastle United to his signature.",
      "United signed Sesko in a deal worth up to £74million from RB Leipzig to add to Ruben Amorim's squad in a summer that has seen Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also arrive at Old Trafford. Club chiefs were able to persuade Sesko that United was the correct club to join, despite Premier League rivals having a bid accepted first and being able to offer Champions League football.",
      "Arsenal were an early contender for Sesko's signature too, with the Slovenia international among their priorities. Such was the fee required, the Gunners decided to move on to land Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP instead.",
      "But it was United's persistent efforts that ultimately proved successful in getting a move over the line. And a longstanding relationship between the parties paid off.",
      "\"We were in contact with Man United's negotiations director, Matt Hargreaves, who was a ruthless negotiator,\" Basanovic told the 24UR programme on Slovenian station POP! TV.",
      "\"In the last 10-15 days, they followed my every step, and the talks took place in three different countries and six different cities.\"",
      "Sesko had been of interest to United for as long as seven years and the forward's agent had kept the club well aware of his plans. While Sesko opted against moving to Manchester as a teenager, a transfer to the Premier League was always on the agenda.",
      "Basanovic added: 'We visited their academy when he was just 15. Even then, we were planning this move for the future. At the time, we didn't want him to go [when he was] so young.",

      "\"Whenever a deal doesn't go through, there are always several factors. In the end, everything has to align for it to happen.",
      "\"What's important here is that Benjamin's wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.\"",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton could be thrown into disarray by Liverpool's transfer plans. Ruben Amorim's squad are considering midfield targets after bringing in three forwards this summer.",
      "New striker Benjamin Sesko is set to lead a revamped United attack, supported by fellow signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. After assembling their front three, United have shown interest in Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Seagulls' hefty price tag has reportedly led the club to consider Palace ace Wharton as an alternative. However, United's chances of securing a deal for Wharton could hinge on the futures of Palace's other star players, Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "The Independent has stated that United have identified Wharton as an alternative to Baleba due to the latter's price tag, said to exceed £100million. However, it is suggested that the Eagles may demand even more for Wharton if they do part with England duo Guehi and Eze.",
      "Liverpool are keen on Guehi to strengthen Arne Slot's defensive choices. The 25-year-old is in the final year of his contract and Liverpool are hoping to sign the centre-back for £35m, while Palace are believed to be demanding £40m. The centre back is keen on the move but a deal looked to be off with both clubs some distance apart on his valuation.",
      "However, Guehi's situation at Palace has been further muddled by the club's interest in Liverpool's Harvey Elliott, who is valued at the same price. The Sun reports that a swap deal involving Guehi and Elliott hasn't been ruled out, which could damage United's hopes of signing Wharton.",
      "There was previously hope that Guehi might remain at Palace this season, potentially making the Eagles more receptive to offers for Wharton. However, the club are not prepared to let the defender walk away for nothing next summer.",
      "Following Palace's Community Shield victory last weekend, chairman Steve Parish said: \"Players come and go in football clubs, you know, I mean, it's a life cycle isn't it? Hopefully they're still here. That's what I'd like but we'll see.\"",
      "In the meantime, Palace are reportedly eyeing up Elliott as a potential replacement for Eze, who has caught the attention of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Eze's release clause is set at £68m, but it s claimed to be expiring on Friday.",
      "Should Palace part ways with just one of Eze or Guehi, the Eagles might be more inclined to consider bids for Wharton. However, if both Guehi and Eze depart, they'll become even more determined to retain the midfielder and will boast a stronger financial position following potential transfer fees for the duo.",
      "The 21-year-old has garnered widespread praise since his switch to Selhurst Park from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024, although injury setbacks hampered his campaign last term, limiting him to just 20 league outings.",
      "The defensive midfielder shares the same age as Baleba, who has likewise caught the eye in the Premier League since his move to Brighton from Lille two years ago. His boss, Fabian Hurzeler, dismissed speculation that Baleba was set to depart the club after he sat out Brighton's friendly against Wolfsburg due to a minor knee problem.",
      "\"He trained today, he trained yesterday,\" Hurzeler said. \"So we don't want to take any risks, but he will be back.\"",
      "United are eager to bolster their midfield ranks ahead of the forthcoming season. Amorim chiefly turned to Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield last campaign.",

      "Roy Keane made his thoughts clear on Manchester United's transfer plans by blasting Sir Jim Ratcliffe over his decision to get rid of staff meals. It's been an expensive summer for the Premier League side who've spent over £210million following what was one of the worst seasons in the club's modern history.",
      "Bringing in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and most recently Benjamin Sesko, Ruben Amorim has transformed his attacking line-up through heavy spending. Despite the overhaul at the top end of the pitch, the Red Devils still possess issues in defence and midfield, especially the latter, with no signings having been made to improve the engine room.",
      "United are interested in signing Brighton's Carlos Baleba, who is reportedly valued at £100million by the Seagulls, who want to recoup a nine-figure fee to part ways with the talented 21-year-old.",
      "The Red Devils have also been linked with a move for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced his acrimonious exit from the French champions on Wednesday after being shunned by Luis Enrique. Donnarumma could well join City instead but United have also been linked with other big-money moves, including for Emiliano Martinez and Adam Wharton.",
      "The two potential incomings were discussed on the return of The Overlap's Rest is Football podcast, as Keane took aim at United's possible further expenditure. \"If United were to get him [Donnarumma] and there's talk of Baleba from Brighton which I can't believe,\" Gary Neville began saying.",
      "After the Irishman asked how United would get the money to pay for Donnarumma and Baleba, Jamie Carragher piped in and said: \"I thought they were going bankrupt. They were months away from going bust weren't they?\"",
      "The Liverpool legend referenced Ratcliffe's claim earlier this year, where he said the club would have run out of money by Christmas this year if he hadn't introduced several rounds of redundancies and cut back on staff meals to save money.",
      "\"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put £232.72m ($300m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer, he told the BBC. \"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans.",
      "\"The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\" In jest, Keane responded with: \"Are the staff gonna get their sandwiches back?\" It was in February that it was announced that free lunches for staff at Old Trafford and Carrington were removed, as well as the closure of the staff canteen at the stadium.",
      "While Keane said United's struggling midfield will receive some respite due to the ability of the new attackers to be on the front foot, it remains an issue for Amorim. The ex-United skipper said: \"There's slightly less pressure on their midfield, don't get me wrong, but that will be the problem that'll still hold them back over the next year or two unless they bring in players.",
      "\"But they have to start somewhere. They weren't going to bring seven or eight players.\" When asked by Neville whether he believes they could pull off a move for Baleba, Keane said there's one main reason a deal won't be done.",
      "\"I'd be surprised if it happens,\" he said. \"I still think he's got to do a bit more. It's still potential. You can't pay £100m for a player that you don't know where it's going to go.\" Amorim's new-look United attack will face an immediate acid test as the Red Devils' campaign commences on Sunday when they host Arsenal.",

      "Manchester United may have finally found a route out of Old Trafford for Jadon Sancho but it will come at significant cost. Serie A giants Roma have launched a £20million bid for the England international — a figure more than £50m short of what they paid for the winger in 2021.",
      "Sancho's four-year spell at United has not seen him find the success many anticipated. A falling out with Erik ten Hag in 2023/24 saw him return to Borussia Dortmund on loan before he spent last season at Chelsea.",
      "The Blues had an obligation to make his move to Stamford Bridge permanent but opted to pay a £5m penalty to see him return to United. Sancho has not been part of Ruben Amorim's first-team set-up this summer and has trained separately as he attempts to broker a move to a new club.",
      "Juventus had been hotly linked with securing a move for the 25-year-old who has just one year remaining on his contract. The Turin-based team have not been forthcoming in getting a deal over the line however, with one Italian chief suggesting players would need to be sold to coutenance a deal.",
      "United have already been forced to admit they will sell Sancho for less than £25m this summer, while Roma could also be interested in a loan deal, per BBC. That would contain clauses to be triggered at the end of the season but is complicated by Sancho's contract situation.",
      "The Red Devils have an option to extend the star's deal by a further year but his significant salary places some doubt over whether United would be willing to action such a move. Sancho was willing to half his wages in order to facilitate a move to Juventus, but the Old Lady were able to offer the lure of Champions League football, Roma are unable to provide the same incentive.",
      "Sancho is one of a number of players United have been unable to get off their books so far this summer. The ex-Manchester City youth product has been kept away from first team operations along with Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The latter is hoping for a move to Chelsea having agreed personal terms but a fee has not yet been agreed between clubs. Antony meanwhile is holding out for a transfer to Real Betis but has been handed an ultimatum by United to make a move more quickly with the La Liga side planning on waiting until the very end of the summer window.",
      "United boss Amorim has suggested that group could yet return to his plans. \"Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team,\" said Amorim earlier in the summer.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Neville has warned Manchester United that they risk missing out on European football unless they sign a new goalkeeper. The pundit believes that Ruben Amorim must upgrade on Andre Onana in the final weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have been busy in the transfer market, with Benjamin Sesko joining the ranks and potentially forming part of a new-look front three under Amorim. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who netted a combined 35 league goals for Wolves and Brentford last season, have also arrived at Old Trafford.",
      "United are eyeing a move for Brighton's highly-rated midfielder Carlos Baleba as they look to bolster another area of their squad. However, Neville insists that without a new number one - amid links to PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma - United could fall short of their ambitions.",
      "\"You've got to get a goalkeeper. If you've got a goalkeeper and a midfield player, I think fifth or sixth will be achievable,\" Neville stated on the Stick to Football podcast. \"I think without a goalkeeper, it's eighth or ninth.",
      "\"That is the number one most difficult position in English football, Manchester United goalkeeper. I think it's the most scrutiny that anybody comes under.\"",
      "As for potential replacements for current first-choice Andre Onana, Neville suggested: \"Donnarumma or [Emi] Martinez. When they said about Martinez from Villa earlier in the season, I wanted him. His personality. He's got guts. He's got that presence.\"",
      "Martinez appeared poised to depart Villa this summer following tearful scenes towards the end of last season at Villa Park, but he seems to be remaining with Unai Emery's squad. Meanwhile, Onana has endured substantial scrutiny since joining United as David De Gea's replacement in 2023, though he has won the FA Cup and reached the Europa League final during his time at the club.",
      "Donnarumma has surfaced as a potential target for United late in the transfer window following his recent dispute with PSG. The Italian shot-stopper was omitted from the club's UEFA Super Cup triumph over Tottenham Hotspur and the 26-year-old posted what appeared to be a goodbye message to PSG supporters on social media.",
      "\"From the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team's success. I am disappointed and disheartened.",
      "\"I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn't happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.\"",
      "Donnarumma is in the final year of his deal and has yet to pen fresh terms, leading PSG to snap up Lille shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier during the transfer window. However, United's cross-city rivals Manchester City could possibly make a move for Donnarumma, despite welcoming James Trafford back to provide competition for Ederson.",
      "PSG's choice to axe Donnarumma from their Super Cup squad suggests the keeper is set to depart the French giants. When asked about his client's future, Donnarumma's agent Enzo Raiola didn't dismiss the prospect of a switch to England.",
      "\"Gigio is very disappointed, I'm shocked, I didn't expect this from PSG,\" Raiola said, as reported by Gazzetta dello Sport. \"We've had so many seasons of respect and success, a castle of four years has collapsed in ten days.",
      "\"The situation went on for a long time because PSG had offered lower terms in the spring, which Gigio had accepted out of respect for the club and the fans. However, in March-April, once we had decided to move forward together, the club changed the rules again. So we preferred to talk about it again after the Champions League final.",
      "\"We spoke again after the [Club] World Cup, they confirmed the situation, and I replied that Gigio would respect his contract but would not renew. Then, in the last ten days, PSG changed everything again. It's a lack of respect, beyond the technical decisions the coach talks about, and in the coming days we will also discuss with my lawyers how to address the situation.",
      "\"We will consider solutions now, maybe in the Premier League there will be clubs able to pay what's needed. Paris Saint-Germain are asking for big money. They talk about respect, but it's only about the money.\"",

      "Wrexham co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac have been handed a reality check on the extent of their popularity. The two actors have taken the football world by storm since buying the Welsh club in February 2021.",
      "The Red Dragons have registered three promotions in a row, lifting them from the National League to the Championship. Wrexham have also attracted a global fanbase after their achievements were highlighted on the Welcome to Wrexham documentary.",
      "However, while supporters in the North Wales city are more than happy to have the A-list pair on board, a new poll shows not every fanbase would be. Betfair's annual 'Nation Predicts' survey shows 66 per cent of more than 2,000 football lovers questioned wouldn't be interested in Reynolds and Mac owning their club.",
      "Liverpool and Newcastle supporters were most against the idea of Hollywood ownership. The findings of the poll conducted by YouGov Sport are perhaps unsurprising given the two clubs' relative satisfaction with their current owners, who are also far richer than the Wrexham pair.",
      "The Reds lifted the Premier League title last season and a summer of big spending has followed under owners Fenway Sports Group. Meanwhile, Newcastle, backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, clinched their first piece of major silverware since 1969 by winning the Carabao Cup.",
      "Manchester United fans were the most receptive to the idea of Reynolds and Mac taking the helm, with 27 per cent supportive of the prospect, compared to 56 per cent against. That could potentially be down to significant discontent with the Glazer family's ownership and, more recently, the partial takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Surprisingly, 69 per cent of Tottenham supporters were against the notion of the Hollywood duo taking charge, with only 21 per cent in favour. That's despite Spurs fans often voicing their anger at chairman Daniel Levy over the club's fortunes in recent years.",
      "While supporters of Premier League sides might turn their noses up at Reynolds and Mac, who recently filed to legally change his surname from McElhenney, their stock in Wrexham remains as high as ever. And former England goalkeeper Nigel Martyn also believes that celebrity ownership can provide a net benefit for football after highlighting the progress enjoyed by Wrexham and Birmingham City, who are part-owned by NFL legend Tom Brady.",
      "Speaking to Parimatch, Martyn said: \"I think it's been a breath of fresh air if I'm totally honest. Seeing things like the Wrexham documentary on television and how open they've been with everything is great for the game.",
      "\"They're popular people and while Ryan Reynolds is somebody that most people think, 'Yeah, he looks like he's a nice guy and he's funny,' both he and Rob McElhenney are serious about how they run the football club as well.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "\"You won't hear anyone in Wrexham say a bad thing about them, I wouldn't imagine, because they've turned them around from a team that had been out of the Football League to one which I expect to see pushing into the higher echelons and the Premier League. It's been tremendous.",
      "\"Anything that boosts the club and the standing of your club in a positive way is a good thing. To have Tom Brady at Birmingham City, for Birmingham fans, it makes them stick their chest out a little bit further and say, 'Look who we've got now.'\"",
      "He added: \"So far, Wrexham have done it tremendously well and Birmingham appear to be making progress. In all honesty, it doesn't matter how much money you throw at it, there is no guarantee that you're going to win the league. But, so far, both teams have bounced up the leagues pretty well.",
      "\"Fair play to them, it's going to be interesting but I think it's a positive thing, definitely, and celebrity ownership, with people trying to copy Wrexham and Birmingham, is probably something we'll see more and more and more of.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",
      "Available every Wednesday, it provides all the insights you need to be a top red. And for a limited time, a subscription to 'Wrexham is the Game' will cost fans just £15 for the first year.",

      "The Red Devils have made their interest in the Cameroon midfielder known but the Seagulls are wanting around £100million before they sanction his departure. Those sort of funds are unlikely to be available at Old Trafford given their summer spree.",
      "Instead the 21-year-old is set to join the Baggies as he looks to aid their Championship promotion push and his own personal development, reports the Athletic. The likes of Harvey Barnes have previously excelled after spending time on loan at the Hawthorns.",
      "Several second tier clubs were keen on Collyer but West Brom, where Ryan Mason is now manager, look to have won the race, which puts pay to Brighton's hopes of re-signing the midfielder.",
      "The United star was part of their pre-season trip to the United States and admitted he was ready to talk with club bosses over what was best for all parties. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan,\" he said.",
      "Collyer came through the ranks at Brighton before leaving in 2022 and those in Manchester were surprised when the chance to sign him came up. He was considered one of the best midfielders in his age group and United jumped at the chance to snap him up.",
      "Collyer was born in Worthing, just 10 miles from Brighton, and was destined for a first-team spot at the Amex until he was released. Ruben Amorim's system in Manchester only allows for two midfielders to play - and one of those is likely to be captain and talisman Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Manchester United's meeting with Arsenal is the headline clash on the Premier League's opening weekend but up to six players could miss the contest at Old Trafford with the hosts sweating on the fitness of Andre Onana.",
      "The goalkeeper has been missing throughout pre-season and has long been in a race against time to get back for the first game of the season. A hamstring issue has sidelined him, leaving Altay Bayindir to step in during the interim period.",
      "The Turkish shotstopper may have to continue against the Gunners, the team he performed heroics against in an FA Cup final win last year. But earlier this month Onana issued a positive update and suggested he could play. He said: “I feel good, I feel great. It’s been a few difficult weeks, but yeah, hopefully, I will be back for the start of the season.”",
      "Ruben Amorim stands to be without several members of his defensive unit with Lisandro Martinez still injured. The Argentine has struggled for fitness for some time and whilst he travelled to the US for pre-season, no timeframe is given on his return.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui hasn't been pictured in training for some time after being forced off at half-time during United’s pre-season opener against Leeds in Stockholm last month. His injury has not been specified but his lack of appearance does not spell good news.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, one player who has been linked with a move away from Manchester amid all the new faces in attack, is touch and go to play against the Gunners. The Dutchman claimed in July that he was targeting his return for the opening game.",
      "Arsenal meanwhile, who drew this fixture last season, will want to get off to the best possible start with Mikel Arteta's side potentially including a number of their new recruits. Viktor Gyokeres is likely to lead the line, which is a plus given Gabriel Jesus remains sidelined with a serious knee injury.",
      "The Brazilian has been out since the early part of 2025 and it meant Arsenal were struggling for players to spearhead their attack, motivating their pursuit of Gyokeres. Leandro Trossard is one player who has done that when required but the Belgian too is struggling for fitness.",

      "England's competition is the most popular globally but all of the matches are played in the UK and that is not set to change. Italy, alongside Spain, have signalled their plan to take a domestic match abroad and are seeking permission from FIFA and UEFA.",
      "It could mean that the Serie A sees AC Milan and Como facing off in Perth, Australia in February. Other one-off matches like the Italian Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup have also been played abroad in recent years.",
      "The Premier League is much more driven by tradition as opposed to some of the other major sporting competitions. Staging NFL games outside of America is now common practice and hugely lucrative but that is not currently on the agenda from a football stand point.",
      "Masters told the BBC: \"I don't think it changes the Premier League's view on this at all, we don't have any plans to play matches abroad. It's not anywhere near my in-tray and it's not a debate around our table.\"",
      "The idea of the Premier League playing an extra round - which became known as the '39th game' - outside England was raised in 2008 but those plans were binned amid huge backlash from fans.",
      "Former Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claimed a decade ago that clubs were keen on the idea, but Masters insists that is not forthcoming despite the amount of American interest in the Premier League. There are 11 US-owned clubs in the top flight, putting them close to the two-thirds majority of 14 that is needed to bring about changes to the Premier League's rules.",
      "Masters added: \"The first thing to say is it hasn't happened yet. You need a whole bunch of things to happen. The Premier League flirted with this over a decade ago and the reason was to grow the league internationally and we were able to do this through different means - digital means, broadcast partners, concepts like the summer series in the US. The necessity that was driving that concept has dissipated.\"",

Palhinha, 30, played under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting, excelled in the Premier League with Fulham and United have recruited three players from Bayern within the last three years.",

      "United head coach Ruben Amorim told Garnacho he could leave in May. Amorim was unhappy that Garnacho, 22, cast doubt on his future and complained about his demotion to the bench in the immediate aftermath of the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Garnacho and Marcus Rashford were dropped by Amorim in only his seventh match in charge at Manchester City on December 15. Amorim was unhappy at how inattentive Garnacho was as he prepared to come on against Victoria Plzen in the Europa League three days earlier.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I think [with] Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said last month. \"And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Garnacho paid for a team dinner by way of apology after he headed straight down the tunnel following his first half substitution in the home defeat of Ipswich Town in February.",
      "After United returned from their post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong, Garnacho posted an Instagram Story celebrating his return from the six-day jaunt. A month later, Garnacho donned an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name on it and posted it on his Instagram account.",
      "United sources have acknowledged Garnacho’s brother, Roberto, has also caused commotion with several social media outbursts.",
      "Garnacho did not travel on United’s pre-season tour of the United States amid his wish to leave and he has been told to report for training at separate times to the first team squad at the club's Carrington complex.",
      "Since United signed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid's academy in 2020, he has made 144 appearances and scored 28 goals. Garnacho decided United's FA Youth Cup triumph against Nottingham Forest in 2022 and he was on the scoresheet against Manchester City in the FA Cup final in 2024.",
      "After Garnacho made his first team debut under Ralf Rangnick in April 2022, he was named in Erik ten Hag's pre-season tour squad that summer. Ten Hag did not play Garnacho in any of United’s four tour friendlies after he was late for a team meeting.",
      "Garnacho had actually reported for pre-season earlier than expected that summer, having represented Argentina in the Toulon Tournament. He made his full United debut against FC Sheriff in the Europa League in October 2022.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Liverpool and Bournemouth kick us off this evening but, of course, the main event is on Sunday as United welcome Arsenal to Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim will face the media for the first time in the 2025/26 campaign today where the topic of transfers will undoubtedly come up.",
      "United have welcomed four first-team players to their squad this summer. Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all been added and could make their Premier League debuts for the club this weekend.",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is set to leave PSG this summer but a move to United is currently deemed unlikely due to their current belief in first choice Andre Onana. The Reds will also be wanting to complete sales before the window closes on September 1.",
      "On Thursday, Jadon Sancho became a player of interest to AS Roma. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia also want to leave United while Rasmus Hojlund is now open to joining AC Milan.",
      "We will keep you updated on all this United news and more in our live blog below...",
      "Speaking ahead of Brighton's opener against Fulham on Saturday, their manager Fabian Hurzeler has insisted that he is confident that Baleba will stay on the south coast.",

      "There will be concerns in the United ranks that Garnacho has been overlooked by three Champions League clubs this summer.",

      "United will more than likely want £40m plus for Garnacho this summer and it remains to be seen if Chelsea will be willing to spend that on the Argentine.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Arsenal, Tottenham and Atletico Madrid were all offered Garnacho and rejected the opportunity to purchase him.",

      "Manchester United would allow Harry Amass to join Sheffield Wednesday on loan for regular game time.",
      "Although nothing is finalised, Wednesday are thought to be leading the race to sign Amass and it's understood United would be happy to send the youngster to Hillsborough Stadium.",

      "Read the full story here.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano on his YouTube channel, Brighton have deployed the same negotiation tactic they used to offload Moises Caicedo, to Chelsea, on Manchester United for Carlos Baleba.",

      "\"What is important to mention is Manchester United are still there, still in contact with the agents, still working on a deal. They want to understand how high is the wall from Brighton but they are still working on the Carlos Baleba.\"",
      "Romano added: \"They are not giving up. Difficult? Yes. Very difficult? Of course. But, United are still there.",
      "\"The player is not closing the doors at all. Personal terms are not a problem, European football for Baleba is not a problem. He'd go to United immediately and I can guarantee that. But club to club, we are still far from a solution...\"",
      "Fulham are showing 'tentative interest' in signing Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund, according to the Daily Mail. Marco Silva's side are weighing up a move for the Denmark international as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject to offers from Serie A side Atalanta.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United for Hojlund and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. However, the 22-year-old has made it clear that he wants to fight for his place at Old Trafford, despite the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last week.",
      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has been given until the weekend by Besiktas to make a decision about their offer before they turn their attention elsewhere, as per journalist Secan Dikme, via Sports Digitale. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are said to have 'gotten tired' of waiting for Sancho this summer.",
      "They're yet to hold negotiations with United about him but if they don't receive a response, they will turn their attention to other options. The pressure is now on Sancho to make up his mind.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand has advised Hojlund to leave Old Trafford this summer to provide himself with further experience.",
      "I think Rasmus Hojlund has to go on loan. I think if I was him, I’d definitely want to go out on loan, minimum – fresh start. Italy. He knows the place and did good out there. I think it would be a good move for him. What could happen when he comes back? Who knows?",
      "Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho has now agreed terms with Chelsea, according to journalist Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport.",
      "The 21-year-old is 'waiting' for a move to Stamford Bridge, as club-to-club talks are advanced.",
      "United insist on receiving at least £50m for Garnacho, as the Reds argue that he should not be sold for much less than the £52m Chelsea got for Noni Madueke, who made the move to Arsenal last month.",
      "However, Chelsea are aware that United need to sell players, especially if they want to pull off a record-breaking deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba before the end of the transfer window.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, following a summer which has seen him be linked and ultimately reject a move to Saudi Arabia, Fernandes has set out his goals for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "I hope you'll hear less about Bruno this year, but a lot more about United. That's my main objective because my name being spoken, let's say vaguely alone, it doesn't fill me with pride or anything. United being talked about, being positive, that's the most important thing and that's what I want for this season. If it happens that Bruno has to score fewer goals, provide less assists or do another type of provision of what is necessary for the games, I would be very happy.",
      "Roma have submitted an official bid to Manchester United to sign Jadon Sancho, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Serie A side have offered £20million to United for the 25-year-old's services.",
      "I Giallorossi are also open to a loan to buy deal for Sancho, should that be United's preference. The Reds, however, are keen to offload the England international on a permanent basis.",

      "While there is scepticism that a deal for Baleba can be sorted between now and September 1, Fabrizio Romano believes that derives from club to club negotiations rather than the 21-year-old's preferences to the move.",
      "Romano claims he 'guarantees' that Baleba would agree a move to Old Trafford quickly if a fee could be agreed.",
      "However, agreeing said sum is still far down the line.",
      "Explaining the latest situation in a Q&A, The Athletic's Laurie Whitwell has discussed the possibility of signing Baleba this summer.",
      "The journalist believes that there is a level of scepticism on both sides that the deal will be done this summer.",
      "If that's the case, it could be time to look at some alternatives that have been mentioned previously.",
      "Along with Wharton and Baleba, it is believed that Atalanta's Ederson and Sporting's Morten Hjulmand are being considered by the Reds.",
      "Ederson has been heavily linked with the Reds for some time now and has yet to move from the Italian club.",
      "Hjulmand, meanwhile, has a long-standing relationship with Amorim after they worked together in Lisbon previously.",
      "Accompanying their update on Amorim's stance, The Independent adds that United see Wharton as an alternative target this summer.",
      "Eventually, the dream scenario would be to play Baleba alongside Wharton but Crystal Palace are expected to be even trickier to negotiate with.",
      "It is believed Steve Parish has no interest in potentially losing Wharton, on top of Guehi and Eze before the window closes.",
      "The Independent understands that Amorim is pushing hard for Baleba to join his team.",
      "He sees the Cameroonian as being a player who could complete his midfield this summer and add more bite to the centre of the pitch.",
      "However, there are alternatives that could be considered to bolster United.",
      "Amid the ongoing reports that United want to sign the Brighton midfielder Baleba, the Daily Telegraph understands that the Seagulls have set a price tag of £100m for him.",
      "It has long been thought that Brighton will value the central midfielder the same as Moises Caicedo who left them to join Chelsea for £115m.",
      "Unsurprisingly, it is believed that United will not want to purchase Baleba at that price.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be with you until 4pm bringing you all the latest United news as and when we get it.",

      "Roma have reportedly bid to sign Jadon Sancho on loan this season.",

      "Kingsley Coman is said to be signing for Al Nassr soon after years of links to United.",

      "Manchester United have strengthened Ruben Amorim's squad in the summer transfer window, but there is an area that hasn't been addressed ahead of the opening game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "You don't win any prizes for guessing it's the midfield. United have signed a striker, two forwards for the No.10 roles and a left-back, but have not secured a fresh face for the engine room.",
      "That has the potential to be problematic and immediately exposed against Arsenal, who have two of the Premier League's finest midfielders, Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard, alongside new addition Martín Zubimendi.",
      "There is positivity at Old Trafford ahead of the new campaign and United deserve huge credit for their business so far, but it's impossible to shake a feeling that they need a new midfielder through the door.",
      "Amorim plays with two midfielders in the pivot and his current options have not complemented each other as was hoped. Bruno Fernandes has been used in the pivot, but is playing Fernandes alongside Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo or Casemiro a sustainable option to secure results?",
      "It says a lot about Ugarte that United already need a new player of his ilk, just 12 months after signing him from Paris Saint-Germain. Ugarte's performances have been mixed and he hasn't truly nailed down the role.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, which represented a significant outlay, but United are planning to invest in his position again.",

      "Arsenal have quality in the centre of the pitch and will be hopeful of winning the midfield battle. And as a result, that could highlight and emphasise how much United need to sign a new midfielder this summer.",
      "The same thing essentially happened after the first two games of the 2022/2023 season. United lost 2-1 to Brighton and were hammered 4-0 by Brentford, which forced them into action in the transfer market.",
      "The midfield was ruthlessly exploited in those games and Casemiro arrived to provide defensive cover. United are very unlikely to have such a bad start this season, but Arsenal could highlight the chasm with midfield options.",
      "Amorim would obviously prefer to secure a victory rather than to oversee the kind of defeat that would send a message to the board about needing to sign a new midfielder, though.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford will be tremendous on the opening day of the campaign against a historic rival, which means United might be spurred to a victory, even with doubts about their midfield.",
      "However, Amorim needs a new midfielder to be successful this season and he appeared to warn that he needs a new signing when he spoke after the final pre-season friendly last weekend.",
      "Speaking to MUTV, Amorim said: \"I think it was a perfect game for preparation to show us we need to improve in different areas that we are going to struggle in some moments. But sometimes we have players who can make a play and elevate the stadium.\"",
      "It felt obvious that Amorim was referring to the midfield with that answer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Tim Sherwood is confident that Carlos Baleba will be joining a 'bigger' club soon amid links to Manchester United.",
      "The 21-year-old has emerged as a target for United this summer, with reports elsewhere suggesting that the Reds are in constant talks with Baleba's camp over his future. It is claimed that United are weighing up whether personal terms for the midfielder would be viable before launching their first bid.",
      "Baleba is understood to be open to the prospect of signing for United, even without Champions League football this term. However, the true test will be to reach an agreement with the Seagulls for his departure.",
      "Brighton are believed to be adamant that Baleba is not for sale this summer. Fabian Hurzeler has already lost Joao Pedro and Pervis Estupinan and the consensus is that the club have shut up shop for outgoings.",
      "However, this does not seem to have deterred United from testing the waters on Baleba. In his Premier League predictions for this season, Sherwood backed the Cameroonian to be the young player of the season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Explaining his decision, he also made a confident transfer prediction for the central midfielder. \"He had a great second season for Brighton, and he will get better and probably move to a 'bigger' club,\" Sherwood said.",
      "Should Baleba not sign, Sherwood's fellow pundit Matt Holland believes the Reds already have a young midfielder who could light up the Premier League.",
      "\"Perhaps a left-field choice, given he didn’t play as much as he would have liked last season,\" Holland said, referring to Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"He has such natural ability and I’m a huge fan of his. I expect Man United to be much better this season and that will help him have a bigger impact in the Premier League.\"",
      "The summer transfer window is due to shut on Monday, September 1, while United begin their Premier League campaign this weekend at home to Arsenal.",

      "After spending almost £200million already this summer, it remains to be seen just how deep Manchester United's pockets really are.",
      "Following a forgettable 2024/25 campaign, United have been left with no choice but to spend big in this summer's transfer market to improve head coach Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Diego Leon has arrived from Cerro Porteno for £3.3m, Matheus Cunha has joined the club from Wolves for £62.5m, Bryan Mbeumo has checked in from Brentford for £65m and Benjamin Sesko has arrived from RB Leipzig for £66.4m.",
      "Considering United are yet to oversee a single sale this summer, it is fair to say they have done pretty well. And there is still a thirst for more additions.",
      "With just over two weeks of the window remaining, United still want to sign a midfielder and possibly a goalkeeper. Their midfield has been a problem position for many years and they are still on the hunt for a long-term solution.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "It has been well-documented recently that Brighton & Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba has attracted United's attention. The Cameroonian has made rapid progress since joining the Seagulls from Lille two years ago, establishing himself as one of the most highly-rated midfielders in the business.",
      "Capable of providing plenty of energy, winning the ball back, driving forward with the ball and offering a varied passing range, Baleba ticks a plethora of boxes. United need a midfielder who is capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room.",
      "Brighton, of course, are the masters of finding hidden gems, developing them and selling them on for a handsome profit. It is a sustainable model that consistently delivers results.",
      "In Baleba, the Seagulls believe they have discovered the real deal. He has been excellent since joining the club in August 2023, so much so some reports have claimed Brighton will demand north of £100m to consider selling him this summer.",
      "Although United could still bring in a percentage of the reported fee Brighton are set to demand via player sales, amid their hunger to sell Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony before the deadline, it feels unlikely the club will be able to meet the Seagulls' demands.",
      "Despite the increasing probability that Garnacho will join Chelsea, no club has stepped forward with an offer to sign Malacia, Sancho or Antony on a permanent basis. Sancho and Antony both look increasingly likely to leave on loan instead.",
      "With that in mind, United might have to look elsewhere for a suitable midfielder. Although the Reds have preferred to try and target Premier League proven players this summer, there is still a chance they could explore the overseas market.",
      "And one option they could turn to is Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber. The Dutchman has less than a year remaining on his existing contract, meaning the Eredivisie outfit could be open to a cut-price sale.",
      "Timber, whose twin brother, Jurrien, plays for Arsenal, has a similar profile to Baleba in the sense he is a dynamic midfield operator, capable of getting on the ball in the centre of the park and driving his team up the pitch. He is also press resistant and can have an impact in both defensive and offensive situations.",
      "United lack a sense of mobility in midfield, particularly in possession, and Timber can provide that trait. The 24-year-old is renowned for his energy output and ability to drive forward with the ball at his feet.",
      "However, his recent injury record will generate cause for concern. He suffered a serious knee injury in February and that forced him to miss the remainder of the 2024/25 season, meaning he finished last season with just 26 appearances to his name.",
      "Timber previously suffered from a knee problem during the 2022/23 campaign, forcing him to miss around two months worth of action in the second half of the campaign. With a knee issue threatening to become a familiar problem for the Dutchman, that will be something for prospective suitors to bear in mind.",
      "But if he can remain fit, just as he did for the vast majority of the 2023/24 season, there is an exciting player waiting to go up through the gears. In addition to being a brilliant ball carrier, Timber can also flex his muscles in attacking sense, highlighted by his tally of 18 goals and 13 assists for Feyenoord.",
      "With Baleba set to cost an arm and a leg, Timber could be a cheaper alternative to consider.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Manchester United would allow Harry Amass to join Sheffield Wednesday on loan for regular game time.",
      "Although nothing is finalised, Sheffield Wednesday are thought to be leading the race to sign Amass and it's understood United would be happy to send the youngster to Hillsborough Stadium.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been in turmoil over the last few months due to problems with the club's owner, Dejphon Chansiri. The Owls were handed a transfer embargo for their failure to pay players and staff, but the embargo has been lifted and they have pitched to sign Amass on loan for 2025/2026.",
      "Despite the unrest at Sheffield Wednesday, United sources have indicated that game time is the priority when considering a loan offer and Amass would benefit from consistent starts.",
      "Amass is understood to be weighing up his options, but United have no qualms about potentially sending him on loan to Sheffield Wednesday and would green-light a move to S6.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday started the Championship season with only 16 registered first-team players after several departures and supporters have protested against the club's ownership.",
      "Last weekend, Sheffield Wednesday fans walked into their game against Leicester City late to protest against Chansiri, and further protests are planned before facing Stoke on Saturday.",
      "The Sheffield Wednesday Supporters' Trust has encouraged fans not to buy other merchandise or food at the ground, while supporters have boycotted the new home and away kit.",
      "After internal discussions and the arrival of Diego Leon this summer, Amass was earmarked for a loan move. Ruben Amorim handed Amass his first-team debut against Leicester in March and the youngster made a total of seven first-team appearances throughout the campaign.",
      "Amass was named on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham. He was subsequently considered to stay with the first-team for the new season, but Leon has impressed in pre-season.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Paraguay club Cerro Porteno to sign Leon, who was due to be assessed this summer before a decision was made on his future.",
      "Leon made a strong first impression at Carrington and was handed a first-team squad number before the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm. Amorim started Leon in that friendly and he made substitute appearances against West Ham and Bournemouth in the United States.",
      "Amass was not brought on the USA tour because United planned to send him on loan.",

      "United went unbeaten in pre-season for the first time since 2019 and brought in four new signings.",
      "Ahead of the visit of Mikel Arteta's side, United's players and staff are continuing to put the hard yards in at Carrington, and here are five things we spotted from Wednesday's training session:",
      "The weather has been glorious in Manchester this week, meaning Ruben Amorim's players have been gearing up for Sunday's curtain-raiser in sweltering conditions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The sun has been beaming down on the club's training ground, meaning United's players have been pushed to the maximum. The weather forecast for Sunday says temperatures could reach as high as 26 degrees Celsius.",
      "Pictures captured from Wednesday's training session at Carrington showed several members of the squad training in sleeveless vests. Among those donning a top of that type included Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Unfortunately, it will not be all that long before United's players are reaching for their hats, gloves and snoods for training.",
      "On Monday, United published images that had been captured from Sunday's post-Fiorentina training session. The day after a game is a recovery day for the starters, while those who start on the bench train as usual, whether they come on or not.",
      "Every substitute from the 1-1 draw with Fiorentina was accounted for except for striker Rasmus Hojlund. It felt somewhat significant amid United's efforts to offload him to AC Milan.",
      "However, he was pictured training alongside the rest of his teammates on Wednesday, meaning he remains in contention to be included in the squad for Sunday's game.",
      "It wouldn't be a United training session without a youngster or two involved. It has become a regular theme at Carrington in recent years, and Amorim has not shied away from giving some of United's most promising talent a chance to catch the eye.",
      "After going on the pre-season tour of the United States, both Tyler Fredricson and Jack Fletcher are continuing to train with United's senior figures. It was confirmed on Wednesday the latter was working with the first-team squad.",
      "Fredricson, 20, was given his senior debut by Amorim towards the end of last season, starting United's Premier League defeats to Wolves and Brentford. Fletcher is still waiting to make his competitive bow for the club, but was named on the bench seven times last term.",
      "With just three days to go until the opening game of the season, it is looking increasingly likely Noussair Mazraoui will miss out. Just as he was on Sunday, the Moroccan was absent from the pictures published from Wednesday's session.",
      "The defender has been missing since United's 0-0 draw with Leeds United in Stockholm almost a month ago, failing to play a single minute of their tour of the United States. He is currently nursing an injury and the last image published of him by United in training was on July 25.",
      "The Moroccan was a key player for the Reds last season, racking up 57 appearances in all competitions.",
      "The start of a new season always brings fresh optimism and hope. After a successful summer both on and off the pitch, United's players have every right to be in an upbeat mood ahead of the clash with Arsenal.",
      "The pre-season tour of the US captured just how positive the mood is within the camp, and that appears to have continued since returning to England just over a week ago.",

      "He is the perfect type of player to act as a mentor to Benjamin Sesko and may not demand the regular playing time that other options could. Mitrovic's arrival would also halt the need to promote Chido Obi too soon and allow Joshua Zirkzee to be used deeper where he clearly helps the team more.",

      "Manchester United appear to have reached a stalemate in the race to sign Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer, but the Seagulls seem determined to hold on to their prized asset.",
      "Baleba - whose contract at the AMEX Stadium expires in June 2028 - featured 34 times in the Premier League last season. Playing a key role in Fabian Hurzeler's side, he helped Brighton enjoy impressive wins over Manchester City, Chelsea and eventual champions Liverpool.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano on his YouTube channel, Brighton have deployed the same negotiation tactic they used to offload Moises Caicedo, to Chelsea, on United. The journalist said: \"For Carlos Baleba, the contacts are still ongoing.",
      "\"This is a difficult deal for Manchester United, not just financially but also in terms of strategy.",
      "\"What is important to mention is Manchester United are still there, still in contact with the agents, still working on a deal. They want to understand how high is the wall from Brighton but they are still working on the Carlos Baleba.\"",
      "Romano added: \"They are not giving up. Difficult? Yes. Very difficult? Of course. But, United are still there.",
      "\"The player is not closing the doors at all. Personal terms are not a problem, European football for Baleba is not a problem. He'd go to United immediately and I can guarantee that. But club to club, we are still far from a solution...\"",
      "According to The Independent, United have identified Adam Wharton as an alternative to Baleba. The report claims that the club may try to sign the Crystal Palace midfielder if they're unable to sign the Brighton ace.",
      "It's said that United are long admirers of the duo. The Independent argues that Wharton could cost even more this summer, however, with Steve Parish unwilling to do business - given that the Eagles could yet lose Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "Hurzeler has insisted that he's not worried about losing key players to other clubs. Speaking on the Monday Night Club podcast earlier this week, the Brighton manager said: \"No chance. I don't feel fear.",
      "\"I'm not afraid of anything, because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, like work as hard as we can. All the other things we can't influence, so we really have to focus on us.",
      "\"For sure, we can't spend the money like the big teams - but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I'm sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",
      "Speaking to supporters at a pre-season fan forum, Paul Barber commented on Baleba's future. As quoted by the BBC last week, the Brighton chief executive said: \"There's always going to be interest in our players.",
      "\"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. Speculation is speculation. Carlos is a fantastic talent.",
      "\"And we hope that he'll be here for years to come, but that's subject to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford will mark the beginning of a new dawn at Manchester United.",
      "After a miserable 2024/25 campaign, the Reds are looking forward to a first full season under head coach Ruben Amorim with a sense of optimism and excitement.",
      "Following their Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao in May, it was feared United could struggle to attract the players they wanted in the transfer market amid the absence of Champions League football.",
      "However, with just over two weeks to go until the deadline, United are still in with a very good chance of enjoying their best transfer window in years.",
      "They have made four new signings thus far, three of whom have been drafted in to try and sharpen their forward line. Matheus Cunha has arrived from Wolves, Bryan Mbeumo has checked in from Brentford and Benjamin Sesko has joined the club from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The trio, before accounting for possible add-ons, have cost United a whopping £193.9million. However, it was obvious to everyone they would have to break the bank to fix their biggest weakness.",
      "Cunha, who was signed from Wolves after his £62.5m release clause was triggered, scored 17 goals last season, and Mbeumo netted 20 for Brentford. He has cost United an initial fee of £65m.",
      "The duo are set to occupy the two No.10 positions in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, providing support for new striker Sesko, who finalised his move to Old Trafford last weekend.",
      "Signing a centre-forward had to be United's main priority this summer after finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10. Chief striker Rasmus Hojlund scored a paltry four league goals last term.",
      "With Hojlund being left out of the starting XI for United's last two warm up matches, it is incredibly likely Sesko will make his debut for the club as a starter against the Gunners. He will have had a full week's worth of training by the time Sunday comes around.",
      "With United spending almost £200m to assemble their new attack, there is no chance of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko coming to Old Trafford to warm the bench. They have been brought in to start and set about the challenge of boosting United's attacking output.",
      "Poised to be unleashed as a front-three for the first time this weekend, it will mark the first time since 2015 that at least three new signings have been included in United's starting XI for their Premier League opener.",
      "Louis van Gaal was the last United manager to throw at least three new recruits straight into the XI for a Premier League curtain-raiser, handing out debuts to Sergio Romero, Matteo Darmian, Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay for a 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford a decade ago.",
      "One of the biggest positives about United's recruitment this summer is that they have been able to secure the signatures of three high profile signings before the season has even started. That offers a massive boost in several different ways.",
      "Despite securing four of their five new additions ahead of last season's curtain-raiser, Noussair Mazraoui was the only starter. Fellow new recruit Joshua Zirkzee came off the bench to score the winner.",
      "With a new-look attack ready and raring to go this time around, Amorim will be hoping he doesn't have to turn to the bench.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The Reds have enjoyed a busy summer of the pitch in preparation for the start of the new Premier League campaign this weekend, bringing in four new players. They have prioritised attacking signings this summer and have drafted in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, Rooney, who is pleased with the addition of Sesko, highlighting what he will bring to the table, believes United still need to add a midfielder to Ruben Amorim's squad ahead of the window closing on September 1.",
      "\"I think it was something that was very much needed,\" Rooney told BBC Sport, reflecting on the additions of three attackers. \"It's great they have identified the players they wanted quite early.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"They got Cunha in, Mbeumo in, and I think Sesko is a really important signing. As a target man, he is quick, he can use both feet and he's good in the air. I think that is a very important signing for United.",
      "\"I would still like to see them sign a solid midfield player who will help control games for them.\"",
      "As Rooney was making his address, he was interrupted by fellow pundit Danny Murphy, who suggested Manuel Ugarte is an option available to Amorim to provide control in midfield.",
      "Rooney replied: \"I would still like one more. I would like to see Bruno push forward and that [the addition of a midfielder] allows him to go forward and play forward more.",

      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United could fall short of the European places again if they fail to sign a new goalkeeper in the transfer window.",
      "United have revamped their forward line during the summer, with the arrival of striker Sesko completing what could be a completely new front three for Ruben Amorim. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were identified as top targets after scoring a combined 35 goals last season in the Premier League for Wolves and Brentford, respectively.",
      "The club are interested in highly-valued Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba as United look to address another area of the team. However, Neville has warned that the club could fall short of their aims without signing a new number one, amid recent links with PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "“You’ve got to get a goalkeeper. If you’ve got a goalkeeper and a midfield player, I think fifth or sixth will be achievable,” Neville argued on the Stick to Football podcast. “I think without a goalkeeper, it’s eighth or ninth.",
      "“That is the number one most difficult position in English football, Manchester United goalkeeper. I think it’s the most scrutiny that anybody comes under.”",
      "In terms of the players who Neville believes could replace current first-choice Andre Onana, he said: “Donnarumma or Martinez. When they said about Martinez from Villa earlier in the season, I wanted him. His personality. He’s got guts. He’s got that presence.”",
      "Martinez looked set to leave Villa this summer after emotional scenes in the penultimate game of the season at Villa Park, but appears to be staying with Unai Emery’s team. Meanwhile, Onana has faced plenty of criticism since arriving at United as David De Gea’s successor in 2023, though he has helped the club win the FA Cup and reach the Europa League final.",
      "Donnarumma has emerged as a possible option for United late in the transfer window after his recent fallout with PSG. The Italian goalkeeper was left out of the club’s UEFA Super Cup win over Tottenham Hotspur and the 26-year-old issued what looked to be a farewell message to PSG fans on social media.",
      "“From the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success. I am disappointed and disheartened.",
      "\"I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.”",
      "Donnarumma is in the last year of his contract and is yet to agree an extension, prompting PSG to sign Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier in the transfer window. However, United’s rivals Manchester City have not denied holding an interest in Donnarumma, despite bringing James Trafford back to the club to compete with Ederson.",
      "PSG’s decision to drop Donnarumma for the Super Cup signals that the goalkeeper is set to move on from the French club. When asked about his client’s situation, agent Enzo Raiola refused to rule out the possibility of a move to England.",
      "\"Gigio is very disappointed, I'm shocked, I didn't expect this from PSG,” Raiola said, as reported by Gazzetta dello Sport. \"We've had so many seasons of respect and success, a castle of four years has collapsed in ten days.",
      "“The situation went on for a long time because PSG had offered lower terms in the spring, which Gigio had accepted out of respect for the club and the fans. However, in March-April, once we had decided to move forward together, the club changed the rules again. So we preferred to talk about it again after the Champions League final.",
      "\"We spoke again after the [Club] World Cup, they confirmed the situation, and I replied that Gigio would respect his contract but would not renew. Then, in the last ten days, PSG changed everything again. It's a lack of respect, beyond the technical decisions the coach talks about, and in the coming days we will also discuss with my lawyers how to address the situation.",
      "“We will consider solutions now, maybe in the Premier League there will be clubs able to pay what’s needed. Paris Saint-Germain are asking for big money. They talk about respect, but it’s only about the money.\"",

      "It’s known that both he and the Spanish club want to reunite if possible, but so far, Betis have looked unable to drum up the required funds for the move for the United man.",
      "That issue could be taken off the table soon, though. According to Estadio Deportivo, one of the options being considered to ‘unblock the situation’ is a new deal being offered to the winger at Old Trafford.",
      "That is an option Antony is said to view ‘more favourably’ than in recent weeks.",
      "That is as it could open the door for a loan move which would be good for all parties. Antony will not want to be tied down to then sit on the bench, but this avenue should be good for him.",
      "If he was to go on loan in his current circumstances, with his contract ending in 2027, he’d have just a year left on his deal at the end of that, and United would either get a small fee, or Antony could see out the final year and leave for free.",
      "If he extends his deal, the Red Devils will surely be happier allowing him to go out on loan again, knowing there’s still a good chance of them receiving a fee in the future, particularly if Antony plays well.",
      "For Betis, a loan seems the best course of action as they don’t have to drum up cash for the winger, but they’ll be able to get him back on a short-term deal, potentially to pick up where he left off last term.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the week that Antony had been told he needs to accept an exit by the end of the week or the threat of him being sidelined until January looms.",
      "That would have been a huge shame for the forward in relation to his World Cup chances. He was in the latest Brazil squad off the back of his Betis performances, getting back into international contention for the first time since 2023.",
      "Continuing to play well at Betis would have given him the chance to stay in contention for Brazil and potentially to play in the World Cup.",

      "",
      "10) Burnley – £111.89m\nFor their latest attempt at Premier League survival, Burnley have decided to build around some Chelsea cast-offs and some loanees whose deals were made permanent.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; they desperately need some transfer depth, even if the Super Cup clash with PSG was encouraging.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £132.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",
      "The Red Devils have transformed their attack in the summer transfer market with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all arriving.",
      "But Man Utd are still looking to bring in more players with a defensive midfielder and goalkeeper top of their list before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Brighton midfielder Baleba is their priority target in midfield with the Red Devils prepared to see if the conditions are right for them to make an official offer.",
      "Speaking on Thursday, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “For Carlos Baleba, the contacts are still ongoing. This is a difficult deal for Manchester United, not just financially but also in terms of strategy.",
      "“Brighton at the moment are still not giving an official number to Manchester United. They did a similar situation with Moises Caicedo two years ago when he went to Chelsea, they were not giving a number, not giving an indication. Then when Liverpool arrived with an official bid, Chelsea offered a bit more and signed the player. Brighton are not giving a number for Baleba and keep saying they do not want to sell.",
      "READ: Ten Man Utd alternatives to Carlos Baleba features Chelsea, Spurs and Aston Villa stars",
      "“What is important to mention is Manchester United are still there, still in contact with the agents, still working on a deal. They want to understand how high is the wall from Brighton but they are still working on the Carlos Baleba. They are not giving up. Difficult? Yes. Very difficult? Of course. But, Man United are still there.",
      "“The player is not closing the doors at all. Personal terms are not a problem, European football for Baleba is not a problem. He would go to Man United immediately, I can guarantee that. But club to club, we are still far from a solution.”",
      "Before Romano added on X on Friday morning: ‘Man United keep working on Carlos Baleba deal. Sales (Garnacho, Antony, Sancho) could be key for higher bid. Initial approach to discuss with Brighton ready, deal difficult; #BHAFC want to keep + eventually sell in 2026. Carlos, keen on the move.’",
      "While in another update, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Carlos Baleba, contacts are continuing on a daily basis with his agents and also with Brighton.",
      "“For Manchester United to present an official bid and to understand if it is worth negotiating with Brighton, it is important to see outgoings.",
      "“Selling players or finding solutions for players who are not part of the squad is really important.”",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are in front of neighbours Man City in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton this summer, according to reports.\nThe Red Devils are looking to continue…",
      "Manchester United have made a decision on Carlos Baleba as Brighton ‘have to listen to offers’ for the midfielder, who will be their ‘next major sale’.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has demanded that the Red Devils see through a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, according to reports.\nThe Red Devils have…",
      "Man Utd could free up an extra £75m in order to seal a record-breaking transfer for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, according to reports."

      "Players are ranked by size of the initial fee, with add-ons stated.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "10) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "13) Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain) – £54.3m rising to £57m with add-ons\nBournemouth held firm for as long as they could but were only able to resist the European champions for so long before making their third sale of a defender for at least £40m this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "15) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",
      "16) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nChelsea didn’t have enough forwards already.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nThere was an actual petition launched against the signing of Madueke, who might well have come in handy last season when it turned out Raheem Sterling was no Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "18) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma makes an awful lot of sense to replace Andre Onana as No.1 and won’t cost the world, but while we can absolutely see why Amorim has pinpointed Carlos Baleba as his ‘perfect’ midfielder, reports suggest the Red Devils aren’t able to drum up the £100m-plus required to sign him from Brighton this summer.",
      "They absolutely need a midfielder in a similar mould though, and as luck would have it, the great guys at FBRef have a very nifty list of 10 players from across Europe’s top five leagues who have similar characteristics to Baleba. Namely being an aggressive, tough-tackling midfielder who can go past opponents with the ball at his feet.",
      "",
      "Abdoulaye Toure (Le Havre, £2.5m)\nTen Ligue 1 goals from midfield for Le Havre last season sounds very promising indeed but a 15th-place finish having conceded 71 goals does raise the question as to how good Toure was at his primary job of protecting the defence.",
      "And there’s a suspicion of him taking a ‘f*** it, I’m going to enjoy myself’ approach to football at the age of 31 given his 11 previous seasons of senior football have yielded 17 goals in total.",
      "",
      "Felix Nmecha (Borussia Dortmund, £24m)\nOne that got away from Manchester City, not in the sense that he would ever have played for them, but because he left them on a free transfer in 2021, two years before being sold by Wolfsburg to Borussia Dortmund for £26m.",
      "United have been linked with the 24-year-old, but David Ornstein claimed ‘interest’ hasn’t turned into anything more concrete.",
      "",
      "Amadou Onana (Aston Villa, £43m)\nSigned for £50m from Everton last summer, Onana had a largely forgettable first season at Villa Park, partly down to a couple of injuries but also because of Unai Emery’s typical preference for Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara at the base of midfield.",
      "That’s a tricky partnership to break in fairness to Onana, who would undoubtedly improve United’s midfield but his transfer may also feel a tad underwhelming, as often appears to be the case when he plays.",
      "",
      "Jean-Eudus Aholou (free agent)\nUnconfirmed reports suggest Qatari side Umm Salal SC have already swooped in ahead of United to sign the 31-year-old journeyman, who represented seven Ligue 1 clubs before ‘amicably terminating his contract’ with Angers this summer.",
      "",
      "Mario Martin (Real Madrid, £1.3m)\nAfter 20 La Liga games for Real Valladolid last season the 21-year-old’s off to Getafe on loan this term. We wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Manchester United making a £50m-plus move for the graduate of the Real Madrid academy in 2027, because why sign burgeoning talent on the cheap when you can pay big bucks for them after developing elsewhere?",
      "",
      "Johnny Cardoso (Atletico Madrid, £22m)\nLinked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the window as part of a possible Antony haggle, to the extent that there are several ‘Welcome to Manchester United’ videos on YouTube of the USMNT international, who instead swapped Real Betis for Atletico, which is in itself enough to suggest he would be the right sort of player to aid United. Diego Simeone loves a midfield pr*ck.",
      "",
      "Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham, £26m)\nHe was excellent against Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup and we love watching an on-song Bentancur, but he’s arguably the most Tottenham of all the Tottenham players, somehow managing to have the mercuriality of a 20-year-old winger as a 28-year-old defensive midfielder. We have every confidence that a move to Old Trafford would swallow him whole.",
      "",
      "Anton Stach (Leeds, £12m)\nAs much as we would enjoy the volume of boiled piss leaching into the rivers of West Yorkshire as a result of a player Leeds signed this summer moving immediately to Manchester United, it’s unfortunately unlikely to happen.",
      "",
      "Dario Essugo (Chelsea, £17m)\nWe have a sneaky feeling Chelsea may have another very, very good midfield destroyer on their hands in Essugo, who’s only just arrived from Sporting but will need at least one significant injury to play anything more than a bit-part role under Enzo Maresca this season, with Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Andrey Santos all very much above him in the pecking order. A loan move would be a smart option, but that’s not going to be to United.",
      "",
      "Seydouba Cisse (Leganes, £2.6m)\nRelegated with Leganes last season and a lack of interest in his services from sides remaining in the top tier suggests Cisse is not the big fix Amorim needs as the base of his midfield.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",

      "It’s removed the need for a pick-me-up normally required at this time of year to get ourselves ready and raring for the new season. Player welfare, player shmelfare, and while our football itch has been scratched by that delightful bleeding of one season into the next, so too has our great desire to see big football clubs spend the GDP of small countries on new players in a transfer window featuring several middle fingers to the PSR overlords.",
      "All that, the hope of a genuine Premier League title race and the promise of MORE FOOTBALL on TV than ever before and we’re about as giddy as we’ve ever been ahead of a new season and quite the opening weekend of action.",
      "Before you carry on, check out our at-this-point perfect pre-season predictions.",
      "",
      "It’s certainly a point of great intrigue and you can bet your bottoms we will be knee-jerking with the best of them to judge which of the two is the best thing ever and which is therefore a massive flop in comparison on the basis of this single Premier League outing. The only thing conceivably better than both being absolute horses*t would be for Rasmus Hojlund and Kai Havertz to start ahead of them.",
      "This is a much kinder opening fixture for Amorim than it is for Arteta, as all he needs to do is show tangible improvement on last term by not getting walloped by a side for whom anything less than the Premier League title this season isn’t good enough.",
      "Defeat for Arteta to this Manchester United, because it will still be this 15th-placed worst-ever Manchester United despite summer signings, will bring about immediate calls for his sacking from those horrible people and institutions (us) who feed on that sort of thing.",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Chelsea\nTipped to win the actual Premier League title by two of our boldest predictors after arguably the best six months of any football club in the world. Champions League qualification was shortly followed by completing the European trophy set before they spanked Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final to secure the whole trophy shebang.",
      "Goalscoring concerns have been eased and then some through the signings of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap, while further forwards who may or may not be brilliant have been bought to replace those who may or may not have been brilliant and turned out to be the latter.",
      "There are still doubts in these parts over Enzo Maresca’s style of football but no-one will care as long as they’re winning, and we suspect they may do that rather a lot, starting with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on Sunday before a very soft start to the season then sees them face West Ham (A), Fulham (H) and Brentford (A).",

      "We imagine he’s dreading this season, not least their opener away at Villa Park on Saturday, in which either William Osula or Anthony Gordon will be leading his line. Having long thought Newcastle would at some point have to upgrade Howe in order to take the next step and challenge for the most major of major honours, we’re now left wondering whether they even deserve him.",
      "He’s now the primary reason, perhaps the only reason, we’re not expecting Newcastle to entirely collapse this season.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Florian Wirtz\nA combination of the deal being done early, the Hugo Ekitike hijack and the multifarious Isak bombshells since has rendered Liverpool paying a nine-figure sum for Wirtz – which could turn into a British-record transfer fee after add-ons – somehow insignificant.",
      "That can only be good news for him as he makes his Premier League bow against Bournemouth on Friday night, with Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo, Romelu Lukaku and Antony among those in the top 10 most expensive signings of all time who – at least initially – struggled to cope with the pressure of their price tags.",
      "We don’t see Wirtz as a player who will hide in games or struggle to get involved, and we can’t wait to see how he fits into a Liverpool side who never looked as though they were missing a player of his enviable skill in a playmaker role as they stormed to the title last season.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Wrexham v West Brom\nThe Championship newbies conceded 90th and 96th-minute goals to lose 2-1 to Southampton at St Mary’s on the opening day and have a second chance to bloody the nose of another side well-accustomed to the Premier League in West Brom on Saturday. We can almost smell the dozen or so long reads on a first Championship game at a bouncing SToK Racecourse while the travelling Baggies boing in the away stand.",

      "European game to watch: Mallorca v Barcelona\nThe jeopardy for Marcus Rashford ahead of the first La Liga game of the season isn’t based on whether Hansi Flick will be manoeuvring his team around to hand him a starting spot on the left, but whether Barcelona will actually be able to register him as a Barcelona player in time. They insist that they will, and even if they don’t, this Barcelona is always worth a watch.",

      "",
      "20) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. It comes down to this: Brighton value Baleba at £100million. Man Utd do not. Are Brighton likely to come down? No. No they are not.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed.",

      "17) Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick are wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Around £67million might persuade Pep to part with the Brazilian. But Spurs’ reported bid didn’t quite meet that.",

      "16) 🔼 Kevin – Shakhtar Donetsk to Fulham\nFulham face the prospect of losing Rodrigo Muniz to Atalanta but the £30million-plus they receive from the Italians looks likely to be shifted straight to Shakhtar’s account in a deal which could break the Cottager’s record spend. It’s about time Fulham got around to doing something.",
      "",
      "15) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",

      "13) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",

That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs are close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "10) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days and Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho, but a move to Roma is now looking likely. The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Omari Hutchinson – Ipswich to Nottingham Forest\nA club-record £37.5m deal is close to being agreed. It’s not fully agreed, but it’s looking good.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Nottingham Forest\nBlimey. Forest are moving mad now that their Europa League spot has been confirmed. £26m for Kalimuendo is good business. £37.5m for Hutchinson is…interesting business.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nAnd it looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. Reports say a deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons has been agreed and Ramsey is heading for a medical on Thursday evening.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Giovanni Leoni – Parma to Liverpool\nLiverpool want Leoni in addition to Guehi and it seems they have got him. Apparently, a deal has been agreed worth £26million plus add-ons. So the 18-year-old has flown in and should be a Liverpool player by the weekend."

      "Eddie Howe is pretty high in the betting, with only five Premier League managers deemed less safe.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might if a new-look City make a stumbling start and he decides to sod it all for a game of soldiers.",
      "",
      "13=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "13=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "13=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "13=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "9) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nAnother really interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four points adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we’ve said elsewhere, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "5) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "2=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "1) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",

      "9) Leeds v Sunderland – The Summer Spend derby\nWhile sacking Peter Reid and flirting with financial implosion was the strongest common denominator between Leeds and Sunderland prior to this summer, promotion has pulled them closer together despite being remarkably far apart in their approach to Premier League preparation.",
      "Leeds have recruited sensibly if slowly, focusing on defensive additions to solidify their spine and avoid having to make another panicked May phone call to Sam Allardyce.",
      "Fees have been spent on a goalkeeper, two centre-halves, a left-back and two more defensive-minded midfielders. The free agent Lukas Nmecha has been their only attacking signing after a move for Igor Paixao proved too difficult.",
      "Sunderland have taken a slightly different view, albeit out of necessity due to a less prepared squad and to offset sales. Only seven clubs in the entire world have spent more than the Black Cats this summer, with Habib Diarra becoming their record signing.",
      "Trying to achieve the impossible feat of surviving in the Premier League as a promoted club already pitted Leeds and Sunderland against each other; that dichotomy in perceived ambition has stoked the flames for some.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea v Liverpool – The Tribunal To Determine Compensation derby\nAmong the many words used were ‘seething’ and ‘furious’ when Chelsea had what they felt was ‘a generational talent’ snatched from under their noses in summer 2024.",
      "Their habitual hoarding of ludicrously prodigious teenaged wide forwards at least compensates the selling club fairly; the final amount Liverpool will pay for Ngumoha is unknown but his pre-season performances suggest it won’t be commensurate to his ability and potential.",
      "The results of a tribunal to determine the compensation owed to Chelsea have not been disclosed but previous such hearings have only returned pay-outs of up to £10m, a valuation Ngumoha might well far exceed by the end of a season in which he only turns 17.",
      "A clear first-team pathway at Liverpool was crucial in the forward’s decision to move to Anfield and Arne Slot has already outlined the role Ngumoha can play across four competitions of a gruelling season.",
      "Chelsea will be keeping a keen eye, although arguably should have done so far sooner.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa v Manchester United – The Selection Methodology derby, ft. Emi Martinez and maybe Ollie Watkins\n“Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "“With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.”",
      "It was a wonderfully impotent announcement issued by an Aston Villa side who, by their own account, “acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such”.",
      "The PGMOL response never was revealed but could well have amounted to Howard Webb pointing out they should probably just have beaten a Manchester United side which had already lost 22 games last season by then, regardless of the referee chosen.",
      "Unai Emery hinted that Thomas Bramall had apologised for his “huge mistake” but the consequences of Villa failing to leave Old Trafford with the single point they needed for Champions League qualification are still being felt.",
      "Evann Guessand of Nice has been their only significant first-team signing and there has been a clear reluctance to make the same player PSR sacrifices which defined their summer of 2024.",
      "Emi Martinez was one of those made available for transfer but Manchester United rubbed salt in that wound by only asking for him on loan.",
      "",
      "6) Brentford v Newcastle – The Broken Promises derby\nAn alternative name pitch might be The Hypocrisy derby, so wonderfully has Newcastle’s entire transfer window captured the perennial insincerity at the very heart of football fandom.",
      "Alexander Isak is a treacherous, villainous turncoat who has betrayed Newcastle, been misadvised and refused to train, play or join the club on tour after having his head turned and ear burned by supposed broken promises about being allowed to go.",
      "Yoane Wissa just wants to leave Brentford and is being held against his will.",
      "These contortions and contradictions are a necessary part of supporting a club but a Brentford side already pillaged by richer and bigger teams must have enjoyed any and all attempts to paint Newcastle as an innocent victim of the hierarchy this summer.",
      "",
      "5) Newcastle v Manchester United – The Transfer Food Chain derby\nThe Magpies have, however, been reminded of their place in that food chain to an uproariously chastening degree.",
      "Their best version in a generation, arguably ever, has been routinely upstaged by the worst modern iteration of Manchester United by an absurd margin.",
      "Champions League qualification and a trophy has been outweighed by the very fact Old Trafford is crumbling and players would prefer to be part of rebuilding it rather than having to call Jason Tindall ‘Bossman’.",
      "The semantics on Matheus Cunha can and have been debated but Newcastle were absolutely interested in Bryan Mbeumo before the player removed himself from their equation after Ruben Amorim’s admiring glances, while the moves were put on Benjamin Sesko before his public rejection of the Eddie Howe project.",
      "Newcastle still and will always have a win in the Alan Shearer battle of 1996, but their war over signings with Manchester United incurred some really quite embarrassing casualties in 2025.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United v Brentford – The Refuse To Be Held For Ransom derby\nThe most high-profile of these disputes this summer have largely involved the same set of clubs cast in different roles: Newcastle as both victim and aggressor; Nottingham Forest as predator and prey.",
      "Manchester United trying to pretend they were fighting the good fight against Brentford was a curious development but Sir Jim Ratcliffe has to get his kicks somewhere and if it doesn’t involve people losing jobs we should take it.",
      "There were 44 days between Manchester United bidding £45m plus £10m in add-ons for Mbeumo and agreeing a deal at £65m plus £6m in add-ons.",
      "The intervening weeks were filled with intermittent noise including a claim the buying club would not be held to ‘ransom’, which they eventually and inevitably were.",
      "But even upon the conclusion of the deal, Manchester United were not done. They leaked their fury with Brentford to the usual cabal of journalists after it emerged that the Bees shamefully tried to secure the best possible deal they could for their most valuable player.",
      "Good on little Manchester United for sticking it to big bad Brentford.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle v Liverpool – The £150m Valuation derby\nWhen the signing of a potential £79m forward is only ever presented as a secondary plot point to the wider overall narrative, you know a lot of water has gathered under the bridge connecting Newcastle and Liverpool.",
      "A wise sage once referred to their rivalry as ‘toxic’ because of 1) some results, 2) Newcastle once poaching an analyst from Liverpool, 3) Liverpool being one of many clubs to oppose their takeover, and 4) Liverpool having spent some money more than four decades ago, but this summer did mark a definitive turn in their relationship.",
      "The Ekitike hijack could be forgiven by a club who have known nothing different in this transfer window. A target choosing to join someone else is part and parcel of the game, and losing a race to the Premier League champions who will be among the Champions League favourites can be brushed off quickly.",
      "But the Isak saga has cast an uncomfortable cloud over Newcastle’s summer and left a sour taste. Even when handed all the cards of a three-year contract with no release clause and no need to make a book-balancing sale, the Magpies have looked thoroughly unconvincing with their hard-line stance.",
      "They did land one shot with the loaded claim that Liverpool had ‘bottled’ their first and as yet only actual bid for Isak but there is a clear sense that even if he stays, the damage has been done.",
      "The best-case scenario for Newcastle is that they will be without their best player for the first couple of games of the season, and perhaps on a mental level well beyond that, before he recovers something close to the form which has made him so desirable.",
      "But bridges between player and club can be mended if not fixed completely; any club-to-club camaraderie has been torched.",
      "",
      "2) Nottingham Forest v Spurs – The Release Clause derby\nIt seems like an age since the capture of Mohammed Kudus was followed up with the stunning revelation that Spurs would be signing Morgan Gibbs-White the next day.",
      "More than a month has passed and not only have Spurs not invested that £60m elsewhere, they have also lost to a probable season-long injury the sort of player Gibbs-White would have shared the creative burden with.",
      "Daniel Levy still struggles to understand Spurs fans and was given a public crash course in Evangelos Marinakis this summer too. But the Spurs chairman has played the role of 2013 Arsenal impeccably, understandably but clearly mistakenly believing that triggering a release clause in the contract of a player keen to join would indeed be enough to procure them.",
      "One legal threat, renewed deal and announcement with the air of a hostage video later, all with Marinakis front and centre, Spurs were left wondering what had just happened while Forest merrily went about their business.",
      "Then it emerged that Marinakis felt ‘it would have been a backward step’ for Gibbs-White to leave the City Ground for Spurs and suddenly sacking Nuno or waiting to poach Brennan Johnson felt remarkably tame.",
      "",
      "1) Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest – The Blind Trust derby\nA trick has been missed. There is a chance to rectify it, even if that would require some manoeuvring and would impact a few different clubs. But it must be done.",
      "One of the games between Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest, currently scheduled for late August and January, must be moved to March 1. The narrative must be fed.",
      "It shouldn’t be that match at Selhurst Park on the season’s second weekend; that promises to be biblical. Palace’s first home game, their demotion from the Europa League for Forest to benefit still fresh, perhaps with the FA Cup and Community Shield paraded beforehand, played in between a pair of Conference League play-off qualifier legs, will have a glorious edge to it.",
      "Steve Parish certainly won’t be rushing to offer out any executive boxes.",
      "If Forest supporters aren’t already arranging chants of “decisive influence” to the ‘is there a fire drill?’ tune, or scribbling ‘Rules Are Rules’ on a crude Photoshop of Marinakis and John Textor shaking hands, then they too should have their Europa spot revoked.",
      "And if the losing team doesn’t take the result to the Court of Arbitration for Sport it’s worth wondering what we’re all doing here.",
      "According to reports, Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis ‘erupted’ in a second clash with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo at the weekend.",
      "‘Scandalous from that Forest owner,’ said Gary Neville, but both owner and manager have downplayed the dressing-down.",
      "Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has stepped down from his role to avoid future complications if the club qualify for Europe."

      "The exit push came on the back of him winning the Premier League Player of the Year and less than a year after he signed a new five-year deal at The London Stadium worth £125,000 per week. Best not to mention his name in East London.",
      "",
      "Raheem Sterling\nLiverpool had already rejected a couple of Manchester City offers for Sterling in the summer of 2015 before the winger asked not to go on the Reds’ pre-season tour.",
      "He had already snubbed a £100,000 per week extension in his bid to force a move he eventually got when City coughed up the £50m Liverpool wanted. Deemed a helluva lot for the mercurial winger at the time, Pep Guardiola turned Sterling into goalscoring machine to help them to four Premier League titles in five seasons at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "William Gallas\nHow we would have loved to be a fly on the wall when Gallas told Jose Mourinho he would score own goals or make deliberate mistakes if he was selected for Chelsea while trying to force through a move to Arsenal, who were offering him more money in the summer of 2006 than the Premier League champions.",
      "Gallas got we he wanted but so too did Chelsea, who paid just £5m plus the wantaway defender for Ashley Cole.",
      "",
      "Diego Costa\nInarguably the most understandable strike of all given the combination of Antonio Conte telling Costa ‘you are not in my plans’ via text message the summer after his 20 goals helped Chelsea to the 2016/2017 title and the club’s weirdly antithetical not-for-sale stance.",
      "Costa chilled in Brazil for six months while his replacement Alvaro Morata slipped into depression at Stamford Bridge, before making a £57m return to Atletico Madrid in January 2018.",
      "",
      "Riyad Mahrez\nThe Premier League champion went AWOL after Leicester told Manchester City they wanted £95m for the Algerian on deadline day in January 2018.",
      "“You’ll always have regrets but at that time I thought it was the best thing to do,” Mahrez said after missing a couple of games for the Foxes. “I was away because I needed time to think, it was a difficult situation.”",
      "Mahrez missed out on a consecutive title having missed out on the move in January, but went on to win a further four Premier League gongs having moved to City that summer, along with three League Cups, two FA Cups and the Champions League.",
      "",
      "Sebastien Squillaci\n“I knew if I played against Braga then I would not have been able to play for Arsenal in the Champions League,” Squillaci explained when asked why he refused to turn out for Sevilla in August 2010 despite being named in their starting lineup.",
      "The Frenchman ironically made his Champions League bow for the Gunners in their 6-0 win over Braga, who made the group stage courtesy of a 5-3 aggregate win over Sevilla which may not have happened had Squillaci been playing.",

      "The striker was suspended and fined while agent Kia Joorabchian failed to negotiate his transfer to AC Milan, before returning in March to help City to their first Premier League title with four goals and three assists across the last ten games of the season, eventually leaving for Juventus a year later for a cut-price fee of £12m.",

      "Pierre van Hooijdonk\n“I achieved some memorable things in football but in England they always talk about that and that’s a shame,” Van Hooijdonk said when reflecting on his decision to return to the Netherlands rather than play for Nottingham Forest after helping them to the Premier League in 1998.",
      "The striker already had a fractious relationship with Dave Bassett after the Forest boss promised him an exit after securing promotion, but told Newcastle to pay £10m after a £7m bid. “£10m in 1997 was ridiculous,” Van Hooijdonk said. “That’s like trying to sell a cappuccino for £25.” It would be close to £200m in today’s money.",

      "",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal)\nThe last of Arsenal’s three world-class players — though others are close. William Saliba is very, very near that level. Martin Zubimendi could get there if he adapts quickly to English football. Martin Odegaard disappointed last season, and Viktor Gyokeres needs to prove himself in the Premier League, even if he did score 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP.",
      "But this is about Gabriel, who’s been among the best centre-backs in the world over the last three years. He’s better than Saliba, though for some reason doesn’t get the same PR. His set-piece threat is a nice bonus — even if defenders shouldn’t be known for goals.",

      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",

      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",

That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards. Just a bit too safe, in our view. The third kit is magnificent, though.",

Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",

Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",

      "10) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "9) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",

      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

But better to wait for a nice one than confirm a sh*t one, as we always say.",
      "Inevitably, the combination of red-and-white stripes plus hummel leads us down a vaguely Southampton route here, but while ‘is it obviously a Team X kit’ is one of our core criteria we are going to cut some slack here because we simply don’t think there’s any way around that particular puzzle without abandoning hummel altogether, and we’re very much in baby-with-the-bathwater territory there.",
      "Lovely simple kit, this, so much so that we don’t even mind the centred badge because everything is at least balanced. Collar is 10/10, the chevrons look as magnificent as ever, and quite simply hummel have done it again, as they nearly always do. Great bunch of lads.",

Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible.

      "Friday 15 August 2025 09:34, UK",
      "“We struggled without a reference as a striker.” That was Ruben Amorim’s verdict on Manchester United’s final pre-season game against Fiorentina. “We have a new player, so we will see.” The hope is that Benjamin Sesko can make the difference.",
      "The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.",
      "But the modern United has become, perhaps, the ultimate test of that theory. At £73.7m, taking the summer spending on their new forward trio to over £200m, Ruben Amorim has certainly been backed. That brings pressure to make it work - and quickly.",
      "Amorim has been open about the fact that he is fortunate still to be in the job, reliant on the support of those above him after a miserable run of results that led to United's worst league finish in over 50 years. The consensus is that the mood has now changed.",
      "Luke Shaw recently admitted that the environment inside the club could be \"extremely negative\" and \"quite toxic\" before going on to claim that it is different now. Unhappy players have moved on. New ones have arrived with a point to prove. A cultural reset.",
      "Time on the training ground has helped too and the absence of European football means that there will be more of that throughout the campaign. Amorim will have the opportunity to demonstrate why he was regarded as a top young coach in the first place.",
      "The summer spending raises expectations, however. United are already fifth favourites for the title. Fail to secure European qualification and they will be out of Europe for back-to-back seasons for the first time since the ban on English clubs was lifted.",
      "The challenge is that Sesko is not the finished article. For now, at least, United are not in that market. And their opening Premier League game of the season offers an intriguing contrast. Opponents Arsenal tracked Sesko for a long time, a move seeming imminent.",
      "In the end, they opted for Viktor Gyokeres. The Sweden international has plundered well over 100 goals for club and country over the past two seasons at Sporting - more than Sesko has yet managed in his career. But he is 27. A signing for the here and the now.",
      "Maybe that reflects Arsenal's sense of urgency, a side that has been so close to major silverware in recent seasons, one that is seeking the final piece of their own puzzle. United are earlier in the process, betting on Sesko to develop into the superior player.",
      "His goal output might not be as immediately impressive as that of Gyokeres, but his 39 goals for RB Leipzig in all competitions over the past two seasons means that he has scored more than anyone else aged under 23 in Europe's five major leagues in that time.",
      "It puts him top of an illustrious list, although the presence of another name a little further down it is a reminder that, as former United coach Rene Meulensteen puts it, they are doing \"basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\" with this signing.",
      "That is to say, United are spending big hoping to develop their own elite forward. Hojlund scored nine for Atalanta in Serie A prior to his arrival. Joshua Zirkzee managed 11 for Bologna before signing the following summer. For Sesko, it was 13 at Leipzig.",
      "That might temper the expectations a little. But speak to others and they will tell you that Sesko has better instincts. He is a player capable of finding space in the penalty box, someone who can get his shots away unusually quickly for a player of his size.",
      "He is not yet Alexander Isak and that is reflected in the price tag. But Isak was 22 years old, as Sesko is now, when he arrived in the Premier League after a season in which he scored six times in 32 games for Real Sociedad in LaLiga. That is the trajectory to target.",
      "Making it happen is the difficult part and it is now Amorim's job to help Sesko succeed where so many in a United shirt have struggled in recent years and fulfil his potential. Flanked by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, there is at least creativity around him.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are strong ball carriers who draw others towards them, creating space. \"It is going to be special,\" said Amorim of his two new wide forwards after the Fiorentina game. \"I think that they are maybe at 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.\"",
      "Another word of caution, though. There is some risk that the opposite is true. There were only three players in the Premier League who outperformed their expected goals by six or more last season. One was Chris Wood. The other two were Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Of the 10 previous players to have done that over the past eight years, only Heung-Min Son has scored more goals in the following season - and he dipped dramatically the year after. The vast majority of players have seen their goal output regress to the mean.",
      "One of the reasons cited for Liverpool's signing of Hugo Ekitike is that he actually underperformed his expected goals - they recognised the potential for his numbers to explode. United appear to have gone the opposite route, trying to sign elite finishers.",
      "Sesko could fall into that category having scored 27 Bundesliga goals over the past two seasons from chances with an expected-goals value of just 17.6. Could he be another Son, another Harry Kane, who consistently finishes better than the metrics suggest?",
      "If so, it could define United's season and with it Amorim's reign. There are other factors, of course. The balance in midfield is a concern and the wing-backs will be key. But it is this new forward line that will probably dictate how the rebuild is perceived.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have Premier League pedigree which will buy them some time. Rather unfairly, the referendum on young Sesko may come sooner than that. A swift impact against Arsenal, with Gyokeres among the opposition, would be most helpful."

      "The Premier League's elite clubs are rebuilding.",
      "This summer has seen the so-called Big Six spend in excess of £1bn between them on new signings. With several weeks of the transfer window still to go, the numbers will continue to rise.",
      "Liverpool are leading the way as they aim to consolidate their Premier League title win but Chelsea are close to their total for money spent, with Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United next on the list respectively, and Spurs not far behind them.",
      "There is particular intrigue around the Manchester clubs.",
      "City recorded their lowest points total under Pep Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term. United plumbed far greater depths as they finished 15th and also failed to win silverware.",
      "So, are they on track to bounce back and enjoy the success their fans crave in the new season? Or is the road to the top longer? Much will depend on whether they can master the art of the rebuild, a process Sir Alex Ferguson once said he believed could take up to four years.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have of course been here before.",
      "How they would love a repeat of the successful rebuild overseen early in his tenure following his arrival from Bayern Munich, when City recovered from a difficult first campaign, like the one they have just had, to win the first of many titles in 2017/18.",
      "\"They are one of the exceptions to that four-year rule,\" says Neville.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho came into Chelsea and won their first league title in a long, long time in his first season, creating a kind of unity straight away. Pep Guardiola got a great side that won the title in the space of two years at Manchester City.\"",
      "Neville also mentions Arne Slot's achievement in winning the Premier League straight after succeeding the legendary Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. \"I would say it was a very different team than under Klopp, with different components and ingredients.\"",
      "What they all have in common, and something key to a successful rebuild in Neville's eyes, is that they inherited the right type of characters in the dressing room.",
      "\"You think of what Slot was handed last season: [Virgil] Van Dijk, Alisson, [Mohamed] Salah, [Andrew] Robertson, [Alexis] Mac Allister, Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",
      "\"They are five or six proven winners at the highest level and they have been around the block. They've got pride and ego and they are not going to sit there and use the fact there's a new manager coming in as an excuse not to perform well.",
      "\"Players can hide behind managers. But if you've got good characters and leaders, people who have standards in their personal lives, you're going to get a better outcome.",
      "\"Slot harnessed that. He did a good job with those leaders. But he is not the one in the dressing room. People may or may not know this, but managers might not go in the dressing room at the training ground even for one minute during the week.",
      "\"For all those hours, it is policed by the senior players.\"",
      "Heavy investment was of course vital to the success of those previous Chelsea and Manchester City's rebuilds. But both Mourinho and Guardiola also inherited senior players to build around.",
      "For Mourinho at Chelsea, it was John Terry and Frank Lampard. Guardiola could call on Fernandinho, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at City.",
      "Guardiola has some similar characters now in Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, among others. At United, though, Amorim inherited very different personnel to the dressing room Neville experienced there in his playing days.",
      "\"For us it was Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce. Then when me, [Paul] Scholesy and others got older, it was us. When we left, others took over,\" he explains.",
      "\"You're asking those players in the dressing room to set the standards, to make sure negativity doesn't creep in. The people who sap energy, close them off straight away. Don't let them drain you, the people who constantly whinge in a negative way\"",
      "Amorim is still in the process of overhauling his dressing room as he aims to reverse a years-long slide from their success under Ferguson. Manchester United have signed three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko but are still struggling to shift numerous unwanted players.",
      "\"This is a really unique situation,\" says Neville. \"I said before that you don't get three or four years to build a team, but because of Manchester United's relentless poor form over two, three, four or five years, it will take quite a bit to unwind that.",
      "\"Amorim has got players he quite clearly doesn't want and doesn't like, players on huge money, some of whom have cost huge money. And even if you do get them out, some of their wages will probably have to be subsidised by the club.",
      "\"So, I think he has a minimum of a two-and-a-half-year build to get to the point he wants with his unique system and buying the players he wants to fit that, just because of what has gone on there previously, but he's going to have to demonstrate progress.",
      "\"The problem he has is that you've got a top five now who like they are getting into the Champions League and the penalty for not being in the Champions League is big now because all these clubs - United, Villa, Newcastle, Chelsea - are on the edge on PSR.",
      "\"It's big for them if they drop out of those Champions League places. So Amorim has got to be relatively successful, which means finishing in the top four or top five, all while building a new team and recruiting the players he wants.\"",
      "Circumstances matter too when it comes to rebuilding efficiently. Guardiola knows that well given the importance of expiring contracts to his first Manchester City overhaul. A long list of departures in 2017 gave him space to reshape his squad.",
      "The list of players who reached the ends of their deals after Guardiola's first season included Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna and Jesus Navas. This summer, by contrast, the only one feels like a significant loss in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Guardiola points out there was a significant loss back in 2017 too. \"In that moment, we made one big mistake which was to not keep Jesus Navas with us,\" he says.",
      "\"I think he would have helped us a lot for the next years because he was a player who could play as a full-back, as a full-back inside, as a right-winger. He was incredible.",
      "\"For the rest, the club decided they needed new, fresh energy, so that's why we rebuilt. They bought some unbelievable players like Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva; top-class players who helped us start to do what we have done.\"",
      "Manchester City are having to work harder to shift players this time around. Their signings so far this summer have left them with a squad of 33 as things stand.",
      "Their plight last season shows the importance of forward planning. Could City's drop-off have been avoided if they had acted sooner to refresh their personnel?",
      "\"It's bloody hard when you've got a team that's won the treble, and a group of players who have been so good,\" says Neville. \"But they do tend to grow a little bit old together.",
      "\"It's about how you change it and when you change it when you have been as successful as they have been. To do it after a treble is the most difficult time.\"",
      "Neville sees some parallels between the plight of City's treble-winning team and that of United's in 1998/99.",
      "\"It felt like we only signed one or two players in the two years after the treble. We won the league in those years but then we saw a sharp decline and we only won one of the next four.",
      "\"You get this euphoric moment winning a treble, where you've built an unbelievable team, but within a couple of years they grow a little bit old together and you've got a situation where you can fall off the edge of a cliff and end up having to make big changes.\"",
      "Neville describes Manchester City's current rebuild as Guardiola's \"toughest job\" in management. \"You get to the point where you think, 'will he win it next season, or will it take two or three years?'\" he says. But the man himself sees it differently.",
      "\"The most challenging summer was when I was chosen to be the manager of the second team at Barcelona and prove myself to the board,\" he says with a smile.",
      "\"Then the challenge was to take over the Barcelona first team and prove myself, and after that go to Germany after the legend Jupp Heynckes had won the treble, when my German language was a disaster, to convince the players to keep going and winning.",
      "\"Then it was arriving here and in the first press conference they said, 'the club have brought you here to win the Champions League', and I said, 'wait a minute, please!' After that I was 'Fraudiola' and it was a disaster in the seasons we didn't win it.\"",
      "Guardiola is eager to point out that he saw progress even in his fraught first season, when he was assisted by now Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City finished 15 points behind eventual Premier League champions Chelsea.",
      "\"In the first season we played really, really well in moments,\" he says. \"Always with Mikel we talk about that, that in that first season we started to build something. This season is not the most difficult one because we did it. We proved we could do it.\"",
      "Guardiola is encouraged by how his side finished last season too, even if it ended in the disappointment of a second consecutive FA Cup final loss at Wembley, this time to Crystal Palace.",
      "\"I didn't like the way we lost against Man Utd in the [previous] FA Cup final. I was grumpy. This season, I was sad because we played really, really well. They know it. They knew we were there, the spirit was there, the chances were there.",
      "\"We missed something we have to recover next season. That belongs to me, it belongs to the players, it belongs to all of us. And after that we will create a team which can compete game by game and start in a better position in the Premier League.\"",
      "Guardiola stresses that pain forms part of every rebuild.",
      "That was true even for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who mastered the art during his historic Old Trafford tenure, creating a series of trophy-winning teams.",
      "\"Each transition came with a bit of turbulence,\" says Neville.",
      "\"We then lost the first game of the next season and Alan Hansen said you can't win anything with kids. So, it was a lot of pressure at that time, changing and transitioning, and that is something you have to manage in a rebuild.",
      "\"We didn't win the league for three years between 2003 and 2006. That's the longest I ever went in my career. That was a point where Mourinho was absolutely on his game and [Arsene] Wenger's football was sensational. They were brilliant teams.",
      "\"Our recruitment wasn't the best. It took a while for Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to come through, for Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra to settle in.",
      "\"That was the time where I thought, 'will we win the league again?' We did it in 2006 and that set us up for another five or six years of winning titles because that team was amazing. But the key was the foresight and bravery Sir Alex had to let players go.\"",
      "The principles behind that ruthlessness remain crucial in today's game. It is about lowering the age of the squad and striking a balance between youth and experience while ensuring there is room for long-term growth and development.",
      "\"I used to think of it as a conveyer belt,\" says Neville. \"We came in in '92, '93, '94. We were the young ones at the start of the conveyor belt and we had the older ones falling off. We eventually moved on to the end of the conveyor belt and fell off ourselves.",
      "\"I always thought you needed a group of players that were young, a group of players in their peak, and then a few, four or five, who were in their 30s and set the standards. I think that was the sort of age profile Sir Alex considered when building teams, but there was always some turbulence.\"",
      "As their respective rebuilds continue, Manchester United and City will hope the turbulence eases for them in the new campaign.",

      "The Radar column returns to preview the Premier League's opening weekend with a look at how Martin Zubimendi could transform Arsenal's midfield, a player who could flourish at Man Utd, and an underrated gem poised for another strong season at Crystal Palace",
      "Friday 15 August 2025 09:02, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Zubimendi's Arsenal role examined💨 Cunha to help Dorgu at Man Utd🦅 Palace's underrated attacker🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Martin Zubimendi's pre-season displays for Arsenal offered clues as to why the club were willing to wait a year to sign him. The 26-year-old, whose £51m move from Real Sociedad was tentatively agreed last summer, has already made a positive impression.",
      "That intelligence stood out to those who worked with him in Spain too. \"Like Xabi Alonso in the way he sees football,\" says a former coach. \"So good tactically,\" says an old team-mate. The early evidence suggests Arteta is eager to tap into it in unexpected ways.",
      "Zubimendi has arrived as a No 6. The club view him as a world-class addition in the position. But it was striking how frequently he pushed forward in possession during Arsenal's pre-season games, particularly in last Saturday's 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Zubimendi produced the assist for Viktor Gyokeres' opening goal with a pinpoint cross from the right-hand corner of the penalty area. Later, he could be seen setting up another chance for Kai Havertz with a backheel from inside the six-yard box.",
      "Mostly, he operated further back, picking the ball up from Arsenal's defenders, circulating possession and threading passes forward. Clearly, though, his qualities can be impactful in the final third. He also has a perfect facilitator in Declan Rice.",
      "It was anticipated that Zubimendi's arrival would free up Rice in his left-sided No 8 role. As it transpires, though, it might be more of a mutual arrangement. Against Athletic Club, the pair interchanged positions. When Zubimendi went forward, Rice dropped back.",
      "It is a tactical detail few anticipated but it is easy to see the logic. Why not harness Zubimendi's vision and passing ability in forward areas, especially against deep-lying defences? Who better than Rice, with all his athleticism, to sweep up behind him in those moments?",
      "Zubimendi will bring huge value to the No 6 role. Rice will continue to be impactful as a No 8 too with his drive and growing goal threat. But their complementary qualities, and Zubimendi's rare tactical intelligence, may also offer up unexpected possibilities.",
      "Much of the focus at Old Trafford on Sunday will fall on Manchester United's new recruits. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have arrived at a combined cost of £207.2m.",
      "The club hope the trio will transform their attack.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they might impact the players already in place at the club too. Patrick Dorgu, the left wing-back signed from Lecce in a deal worth £30m in January, could benefit immensely from the arrival of Cunha in particular.",
      "Dorgu impressed only in patches last season as he struggled to develop much of an understanding with Alejandro Garnacho. Both players like to make runs and drive with the ball up the left flank. Dorgu was often crowded out of his favoured zones.",
      "It helps to explain why Garnacho is now viewed as expendable by Ruben Amorim, and why club have recruited a player with very different strengths to occupy his role. Cunha excels on the inside, dropping deep to combine with team-mates and pick out runners.",
      "The differences can be seen in their respective heat maps for last season. While Garnacho typically hugged the touchline ahead of Dorgu on Manchester United's left, Cunha drifted centrally for Wolves. His zone of influence was considerably larger.",
      "Manchester United will also have noted how Cunha's positioning and playing style helped the wing-back behind him thrive at Wolves. Rayan Ait-Nouri, now of Manchester City, dovetailed effectively with Cunha, becoming a vital outlet as a marauding left-sided wing-back.",
      "Between them, Cunha and Ait-Nouri created roughly twice as many scoring chances for each other last season at Wolves as Dorgu and Garnacho managed at Manchester United.",
      "The numbers hint at how Cunha might combine with Dorgu at Manchester United. There were encouraging signs during pre-season too, with Cunha producing eye-catching displays, and Dorgu one of their brightest performers overall, seemingly revitalised.",
      "While supporters of Manchester United, Arsenal and other Premier League clubs look forward to watching new singings in competitive action for the first time this weekend, those of Crystal Palace are preoccupied by the players they could yet lose.",
      "Speculation continues around Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi. But at least the future of Ismaila Sarr looks secure. The 27-year-old, scorer of Palace's second goal in their Community Shield win over Liverpool last Sunday, continues to quietly excel.",
      "His goal in that game, clinically finished from a characteristic run in behind, helped him pick up where he left off last term. It is six goals and three assists in nine games for club and country since he scored twice in Palace's FA Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa. He also buried his penalty in Sunday's shootout at Wembley.",
      "Sarr typifies Palace's direct, counter-attacking approach under Oliver Glasner and he is a creator as well as a goal scorer. His total of 17 big chances created in the Premier League last season was bettered only by Mohamed Salah, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka.",
      "Eze created 11, by comparison, and Sarr posted superior underlying numbers too. The all-round attacking threat brought by the Senegal international is underlined by his average of 0.58 non-penalty expected goals and expected assists combined per 90 minutes.",
      "Only 11 players recorded a higher figure than that. It is a list which features some of the Premier League's most celebrated attackers. Maybe it's time to put Sarr in the same bracket.",
      "A first chance to see new signings in Premier League action is always a highlight of the opening weekend. West Ham's Malick Diouf, scorer of six goals for Slavia Prague from full-back last season, has caught the eye in pre-season.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back in the Premier League predictions chair to provide his insight and best bets.",
      "We are so back.",
      "Bournemouth, with Andoni Iraola at the helm, won't just park the bus on this Friday night trip to Anfield under the lights. This is a side that presses high, plays boldly, and can punch back when falling behind.",
      "Expect end-to-end football, counter-attacks from both teams in a league that is now a fast-break central, and a few defensive wobbles to crank up the tension. Liverpool are going to take a few weeks to gain cohesion and chemistry across their new-look backline.",
      "This opens the door for Bournemouth to add to the scoring, so Liverpool to win and both teams to score at 6/4 with Sky Bet should go close.",
      "The case for an Aston Villa win is very compelling at 6/5 with Sky Bet when assessing all the evidence.",
      "Alexander Isak is missing for Newcastle in a saga that has been managed appallingly by those advising him - it didn't need to be like this.",
      "Of course, Eddie Howe has managed the situation perfectly, giving Isak the disappointed dad treatment rather than going too heavy on him in public. Howe is a master in these situations, but one area in management where he does struggle, looking at his recor,d is getting a team to start the season fast.",
      "Across the first three league games of a season for each club he's managed, he's only working at a 1.25 points per game ratio (P24 W8 D6 L10) and a winless pre-season won't have helped preparations for this one.",
      "Across the Champions League and Premier League, Villa are unbeaten in 24 home games, winning the last seven - including beating Newcastle 4-1 in April.",
      "If there's one fixture flying under the radar that screams goals at the prices this weekend, it's this one. I'm here banging the drum for the over 2.5 goals line at 4/6 with Sky Bet as a base to build a bet from.",
      "Brighton like to be positive at home and play with attacking risk in committing bodies forward, but that leaves gaps which expose their centre-backs. That's why backing the over line in their games last season was a betting-friendly angle, with 27 of their 38 games producing three or more goals.",
      "This has the smell of a goalless grind, doesn't it?",
      "I'm struggling to see how Sunderland score goals at this level. They only scored 1.29 goals per game last season - the eighth-highest in the Sky Bet Championship. Even Sheffield Wednesday averaged more.",
      "Regis Le Bris is someone who is suited to defence-first football and that is very hard to implement in this league with the quality in opposition ranks. Low-probability chances get taken.",
      "Le Bris will want to make this a scrap, kill the tempo, and smother the game. It's Sunderland's best chance for points.",
      "I wouldn't talk you out of the 0-0 correct score at a juicy price of 11/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Now I'm not for one second suggesting Scott Parker's side are about to storm North London and walk away with three points, but I do think the markets are disrespecting Burnley's potential to keep this competitive and overrating Spurs slightly based on their Super Cup heroics.",
      "This is a tough gig for Thomas Frank. Expectation is internally very high and Frank has no experience of managing workloads within a squad asked to compete across four competitions.",
      "They looked strong and organised for large parts vs PSG, but I think we need to treat that piece of form very carefully as the French side were clearly miles undercooked.",
      "Burnley aren't going to change their rigid and pragmatic style going up a level. This could be fiddly for Spurs as Burnley should be able to cover their +1.5 goal start handicap at 4/5 with Sky Bet, meaning we just need them not to lose by two or more goals.",
      "Jhon Arias could just take the Premier League by storm in this Wolves team. All the evidence suggests he'll adapt pretty quickly, be a main man in attack and judging by what I saw at the Club World Cup and from people who follow the Brazilian league, he has the quality to thrive in England.",
      "Wolves have played the Brazilian market very shrewdly in recent years, with Joao Gomes and Andre showing real adaptability to the league.",
      "Quick, direct and a great drawer of fouls, Arias will be to the fore for Wolves as they look to take advantage of Man City's vulnerabilities in transition without Rodri. Back him to be fouled at least twice through the Sky Bet BuildABet function at Evens.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "Friday 15 August 2025 06:16, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "Marcus Rashford has described Manchester United as \"reactionary\" and being in \"no man's land\" - and has called on his club to \"make a plan and stick to it.\"",
      "Rashford departed United to join Barcelona on loan for the upcoming season after a similar, successful spell at Aston Villa for the second half of last season. This was after the forward had been frozen out of United's first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And now, Rashford has hit out at the club's strategy in recent years - saying the club have not begun a transition yet because they do not have a recognisable style of play throughout the club.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been: we're hungry to win, so we'll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it's reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction's always changing, you can't expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team - you're not there by accident.",
      "\"We've been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months - what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we've been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it's like the actual transition's not started yet.",
      "\"To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel - it's not easy. Because if it's not going well, the fans demand [change].",
      "\"But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we've had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of - you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed which managers have been the most influential in his career - citing Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as inspirations - but he left out Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The forward also went into detail about Mourinho's desire to win at United - irrespective of how well you played.",
      "\"They're different but because we've had so many different managers, it's impossible for me to compare [them],\" added Rashford.",
      "\"Up until Jose, I never had a manager who was so fixated on winning. Van Gaal was fixated on winning but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose didn't care.",
      "\"Of course, if he could choose, he would want you to play well, but if you win, you win and move onto the next game. He had this attitude.",
      "\"And it was confusing for me as all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style and winning in a certain way.",
      "\"And in the beginning I was angry all the time - because we had not played well and we won. But because we won and he is a manager who is just a winner, he didn't bring up the points that you know were missing from that last game. Because we've won.",
      "\"But when we lost, he would bring up the points then. After six months, I learned to respect it and reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed the importance of the move to Barcelona on his chances of making England's World Cup squad next summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was named in new head coach Thomas Tuchel's first Three Lions squad back in March - but missed the June camp due to injury.",
      "\"I try not to put too much pressure on the England set-up,\" said the Barcelona forward. \"It's clearly something I want to do.",
      "\"But you don't get that without putting in the hard work just day in, day out. And showing the hard work on the pitch. That's a knock-on effect to the stuff I'll be doing day in, day out.",
      "\"This current group of English players is extremely talented, it's going to be disappointing if we don't manage to go on and do something really special because I think we've come on a lot. For the last few years, it's been: the next step is to go on and win.\"",
      "Rashford also paid tribute to his former club Villa - saying the brief spell at Unai Emery's side went \"exactly how it was supposed to be\" after struggling at United.",
      "\"The timing of me going to Villa, now looking back, it was the exact time for me to do something like that,\" he said. \"The response and reaction of what I got from the people at the club and the fans, it was what I needed in that moment.",
      "\"Six months on, I feel like everything is completely different. Everything I did at Villa, apart from the injury at the end, was exactly how it was supposed to be. The club's on the up so the atmosphere at the club in that dressing room was positive.\""
