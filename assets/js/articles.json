      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's possible return to the Manchester United dugout could spell excellent news for the club's emerging talent. The Norwegian, who guided United to third and second-place league finishes during his three-year spell in charge, is being considered again following Ruben Amorim's dismissal.",
      "Both Solskjaer and another Old Trafford legend, Michael Carrick, who departed Middlesbrough over the summer, have been approached about returning to the club, potentially in tandem. While his tenure ultimately ended in dismissal after a disappointing start to the 2021/22 campaign, Solskjaer's time at the helm is now regarded more favourably given United's subsequent struggles.",
      "One underappreciated aspect of his management was his readiness to trust young talent, something Amorim appeared hesitant to embrace. Both Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay featured in over 100 matches under Solskjaer's guidance, while several other academy graduates reached 50 appearances.",
      "Solskjaer handed Amad his United debut in 2021, while 16 youngsters in total, including Anthony Elanga, made their maiden senior appearance under his management. Discussing Solskjaer in early 2021, Ferguson told the BBC: \"If you don't get results, there's questions to be asked. He is getting the results, he really has done very well.",
      "\"And what is really important for this club is to introduce young people, and he's given young players a chance. The young guys, if they are good enough, play them. Never a problem at this club.\"",
      "It would be interesting to hear Ferguson's thoughts on Amorim's handling of youngsters, particularly given the Portuguese coach's blunt assessment that some were overpaid and entitled before his dismissal.",
      "He recently said: \"They feel entitlement and then they have legends of the club saying, 'If you don't play, then leave.' No, let's stay and fight and overcome. We have to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "Amorim evidently lacked faith in Kobbie Mainoo, suggesting the midfielder hadn't done enough in training or during his sparse appearances to warrant a regular starting berth.",
      "He explained: \"In the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbie has had opportunities, especially last year. Everyone has.\"",
      "Furthermore, he was scathing about less-established prospects, such as Harry Amass, who is on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, claiming he was \"struggling in the Championship\" and highlighting Toby Collyer's minimal playing time at West Brom.",
      "He also justified his reluctance to give promising attacker Chido Obi a chance by emphasising he wasn't even a regular starter for the under-21s.",
      "While Amorim may have been accurate in his assessments, whether he should have publicly aired his doubts about the club's emerging talent remains questionable and presumably didn't go down well with the club's hierarchy, who ultimately decided a change was necessary.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Thomas Tuchel is the outstanding choice to be the next Manchester United manager. But it feels as if everyone is just afraid to admit it because Tuchel’s No1 priority is being in charge of England’s World Cup campaign this summer.",
      "It is certainly a distraction the Football Association could do without ahead of the tournament which Tuchel was brought in to win. And you can bet that Tuchel will not welcome questions on the subject, although he is unlikely to face any sort of media scrutiny until England play next in March.",
      "However, Tuchel fits the United bill because they have made it clear they want a manager with Premier League experience, which is definitely a lesson learned from the whole Ruben Amorim reign. Tuchel is also an outstanding coach with real pedigree, he is highly regarded on the world stage and has experience of managing big clubs.",
      "The German coach led Chelsea to the Champions League and also managed Bayern Munich as well as Paris Saint Germain. You cannot begin to doubt his CV which is very different to someone like Oliver Glasner who is doing a remarkable job at Crystal Palace, leading the club to their first ever major trophy after they lifted the FA Cup.",
      "But managing Palace would be very different to United and, together with it, the whole discussion about “managing up” and whether Glasner would be a good fit at Old Trafford. Glasner could be a huge success but you are into that unknown and risk territory again whereas Tuchel comes with more of a guarantee and experience.",
      "Clearly, United have taken a view on installing a caretaker manager until the summer with Darren Fletcher taking charge of their game at Burnley. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be back at the wheel until the end of the season which feels like a ridiculous and also comedy step back in time.",
      "But that is being done with the clear intention of waiting if necessary for the best candidate and then it is just a question of whether the stars align. It would be naive to suggest that if United went for Tuchel then it would not become a distraction. It never pans out well when there is uncertainty over an England manager going into a tournament.",
      "Tuchel has indicated how happy he is in the role and how much he is enjoying it, even hinting that he would quite fancy a contract beyond his 18 months which expires after the World Cup. Overall, Tuchel has done a great job after leading England to faultless qualifying campaign and they will be among the favourites at the World Cup having already been placed in the top four seeds.",
      "This is a great opportunity for Tuchel and England to deliver something truly unforgettable. It is also once-in-a-lifetime for him so it is hard to believe he would take his eye off the ball. But Tuchel was sounded out by United previously when they opted to stick with Erik ten Hag and any manager would be tempted.",
      "United have issues like many clubs as to whether it is set up for success and the structure. But any manager in world football would sit up and listen if United were interested. And that is why even with the World Cup on the horizon, this is a story which could easily develop.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is exactly what Manchester United are looking for at present if Michael Carrick's past assessment is anything to go by. The Norwegian has been linked with a grand return to Old Trafford on an interim basis following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this week.",
      "In an official statement, United explained that the decision was made to give the club the \"best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish\" in the second-half of the season. As a result, the board are now scouting the market for a suitable successor, with a number of names emerging as candidates.",
      "While the likes of Crystal Palace boss, Oliver Glasner, Enzo Maresca and Gareth Southgate have been named by the bookmakers as potential long-term successors, it is reported that United could be looking at bringing in a short-term head coach before assessing their options at the end of the season.",
      "Carrick and Solskjaer have ultimately emerged as potential names for an interim job, given both men have prior experience at the helm of the club and hold stellar relationships with the top brass of Old Trafford. As a result, the club are set to sit down with both men to engage in conversation regarding a stint with the club until the end of 2025/26.",
      "However, Carrick may well have already talked himself out of the opportunity with a glowing assessment of Solskjaer in the not too distant past.",
      "Speaking in 2019, the 44-year-old said of the Norwegian: \"Ole’s got that personality that rubs off on everybody, he’s so positive, he’s so upbeat all the time. I think you can see that rubbing off on individuals, and that goes a long way to bringing the best out of the players.\"",
      "It comes as Darren Fletcher will take charge of United's clash with Burnley come Wednesday evening, as United look to continue in their fine vein of form in the Premier League. It is also understood that the club will hold talks with the Scot over the potential of taking over until season's end, while Ruud van Nistelrooy has reportedly been snubbed by his former club.",
      "The Mail report that while the Dutchman was initially in the running for the job, he has since drifted out of contention. That's despite Van Nistelrooy proving his worth in October 2024 after the sacking of Erik ten Hag.",
      "Van Nistelrooy stepped in as a caretaker manager four four matches before the appointment of Amorim in November, achieving three wins and a draw before moving on to take control of Leicester City's first-team.",
      "His run in the Midlands was far less fruitful last season, with the Foxes ultimately suffering relegation to the Championship and parting ways with the 49-year-old in June via mutual consent. Should Solskjaer be appointed as Manchester United's head coach until the end of the season, the club could be in good hands.",
      "The 52-year-old took up tenure with the club between 2018 and 2021, helping United to sixth, third and second-place finishes in the Premier League. While he failed to bring home any silverware across all competitions, his endeavours in the league proved more successful than the work done by David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ten Hag, while Jose Mourinho also lead United to a second-place finish in 2017/18.",

      "Bruno Fernandes' future at Manchester United has been thrust back into the spotlight after the sacking of Ruben Amorim. Fernandes, 31, was in talks to leave Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, forcing Amorim to intervene.",
      "The United captain received a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, who were ready to pay the Red Devils a staggering £100million to prise him away. Al-Hilal also offered Fernandes an eye-watering contract worth £200m.",
      "But after numerous conversations with Amorim, the Portuguese stayed put. \"[He] was very annoying to me not to go,\" Fernandes explained in June. \"The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.\"",
      "Fernandes' good relationship with his now former manager is no secret. On Tuesday, the day after Amorim's sacking was announced, the midfielder was spotted leaving a Cheshire coffee shop with Carlos Fernandes, Amorim's right-hand man who has also been dismissed by United.",
      "In a new revelation last month, Fernandes revealed how he felt 'hurt' after realising that United 'wanted him to leave'. \"From the club I felt it was, 'If you go it's not so bad for us',\" ex-Sporting Lisbon star told Canal 11.",
      "\"It hurts me a bit. More than hurting me, it makes me sad. I'm a player that no one can criticise, I'm always available, I always give my best. I could have left in this transfer window, I would have earned much more money.",
      "\"I would have won many trophies this season, but I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"The club wanted me to leave. I told the directors that, I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision because the manager wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even with the manager wanting me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "With Amorim out of the equation, Al-Hilal could try their luck in January. More likely, though, is a move in the summer, just as Fernandes hinted at in October. \"As I've always said, I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still,\" the 31-year-old said.",
      "\"I can't talk for the club. I've seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn't made with me.",
      "\"I haven't spoken with anyone. My agent also knows how I work. If he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",
      "One man who likely won't want United to sell Fernandes is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who brought him to Old Trafford in January 2020 in a deal worth up to £67.7m. Solskjaer is a leading candidate to replace Amorim on an interim basis, and if he's selected, he'll attempt to get the job permanently and could have a say in their transfer business.",

      "He had lost his job. But the Portuguese had also lost that huge weight that had been hanging around his shoulders. That burden that comes with managing a team which belongs to one of the most dysfunctional football clubs on the planet.",
      "A brutal fact that the regime of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have only served to enhance since purchasing a stake in the club almost two years ago. Managers like Amorim lose their jobs when things are not going well. That's just how it is in football.",
      "Meanwhile, those in positions of power and influence above are allowed to make failings of their own - but remain untouchable. Which brings us to Omar Berrada (chief executive) and Jason Wilcox (director of football).",
      "In the last 18 months, these two bright sparks allowed Erik Ten Hag to spend £300million on new signings, then sacked him a few months later. Ratcliffe's regime hired and fired Dan Ashworth as sporting director in the space of just six months, because his advice wasn't welcomed.",
      "Amorim was then appointed, after Ratcliffe had tried but failed to get Thomas Tuchel. A manager who favoured a 3-4-3 system, but wasn't handed the talent to make it work. So he was sacked after 14 months. And don't get United supporters started on the powers that be signing-off deals for the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The millions United have wasted on compensation and incompetent players is staggering. Something made even more painful to swallow considering it's happened at a time when Ratcliffe decided to make hundreds of employees redundant to reduce costs.",
      "And where has all this left the supposed 'biggest club in the world?' In the position of seeing those Old Trafford kingmakers and silent assassins asking one of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick to take charge on a caretaker basis.",
      "Solskjaer had his chance to manage United and wasn't good enough. While Carrick, who replaced Solskjaer on a caretaker basis for three games when the Norwegian was sacked in November 2021, couldn't cut the mustard as boss of Championship side Middlesbrough.",
      "You genuinely couldn't make it up. How the likes of Wilcox and Berrada are allowed to make such seismic decisions without any offer of explanation or recourse, is beyond baffling.",
      "Make no mistake. Amorim wasn't sacked because of results, like losing at Grimsby Town or failing to beat Wolves and West Ham. He was sacked after refusing to become a puppet for Wilcox, Berrada and Ratcliffe. Which is why he called them all out in his rant at Elland Road.",
      "And if that doesn't make people realise the manager isn't the problem at United - then there will never be a chance of the club getting back to the kind of success it believes it is entitled to.",

      "Ruben Amorim's bold declaration that he would depart Manchester United \"without any conversation about compensation\" may now return to haunt the club's former manager. United are reportedly facing a bill of around £12million following Amorim's dismissal because the head coach had 18 months remaining on his contract.",
      "This payout comes just over a year after the club splashed out nearly £10million to prise him away from Sporting CP in November 2024. When factoring in his salary from their appointment until Monday's sacking, the total cost of Amorim's trophy-free tenure could reach £30million.",
      "United might be able to use the coach's own words against him, though, following comments after the Europa League final. In the aftermath of their loss to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, Amorim said: \"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation, but I will not quit.\"",
      "Maguire noted that matters become more complex when considering Amorim's backroom team. Assistant manager Carlos Fernandes, first-team coaches Adelio Candido and Emanuel Ferro, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and fitness coach Paulo Barreira all left alongside the Portuguese tactician.",
      "The expert explained: \"If they're going to sack all of his staff at the same time, then I think it becomes more complicated than that because, presumably, all of his entourage will go as well. [The club] might be able to hold him to his comment last May, but equally, he could hold the club to its comments from Jim Ratcliffe that they weren't going to sack him.\"",
      "Ratcliffe said on The Business podcast in October: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. He then reiterated when asked whether Amorim would get three years: \"Yes, that is where I would be, three years.\"",
      "Maguire, meanwhile, recognises United are \"fine from a financial point of view\" despite the massive expenditure on Amorim and summer signings alongside extensive cost-cutting measures throughout the club following Ratcliffe's acquisition. He explained: \"They've controlled wages fairly well, partly due to the fact that the players they've recruited, they're coming on big fees but not big wages, and they've managed to shift some of the big wage players, at least out on loan, if you take a look at [Jadon Sancho and [Marcus] Rashford and so on.",
      "\"So I don't see them being in a financial crisis at all. And also for the first time in a long time, they've managed to monetise the academy.",
      "\"You've got the sales of [Scott] McTominay, [Mason] Greenwood and [Alejandro] Garnacho, all the former academy players.\" United pocketed nearly £100million in transfer fees from that trio. Maguire added: \"So all of that's pure profit, which means that they're good from a PSR point of view. It's starting to generate money as well.",
      "\"Historically, they've been a long, long way behind the other clubs in the big six, especially Chelsea and Manchester City, both of whom are super smart when it comes to converting sort of the commoditisation of children. I know that sounds a bit melodramatic, but that's what you're doing with the academy.\"",
      "He concluded: \"So I think that's part of the culture of Manchester United that probably has changed. That has improved under Ineos to an extent; other aspects of the club, perhaps less so.\"",
      "United are presently hunting for a new permanent replacement for Amorim, but are likely to name a caretaker manager until the season concludes. In the meantime, Darren Fletcher will oversee Wednesday night's fixture against Burnley.",
      "However, the club have been in discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick regarding taking the reins for the remainder of the campaign. The former appears most likely to take charge from Fletcher.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has been spotted with former assistant manager Carlos Fernandes just days after he left the club. The coach, along with head coach Ruben Amorim, left the club following a 1-1 draw against Leeds United.",
      "The pressure mounted on Amorim after a post-match press conference that hinted at a rift between him and club chiefs. Shortly after, United confirmed the exit of the Portuguese coach.",
      "Alongside Amorim, several members of the coaching staff also departed, including Fernandes, first team coaches Adelio Candido and Emanuel Ferro, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "Pictures have now showed Bruno Fernandes going for coffee with Carlos Fernandes on Tuesday evening. Images show the duo leaving a coffee shop at around 6pm.",
      "Reacting to his departure from the club, Carlos Fernandes took to his personal Instagram account on Tuesday night to send a message. Sharing a series of photos from his time at Old Trafford, he wrote: \"Thank you, Manchester United.",
      "\"Thank you to the world-class players I had the privilege to coach and to learn from.",
      "\"Thank you to the staff members who showed true support. \"Thank you to the fans who stood by us.",
      "\"In the end, working at a football club of this dimension doesn't just test your knowledge - it reveals character.",
      "\"A special chapter in my life. Proud to have served as Assistant Manager of Manchester United.\" He included a red heart emoji.",
      "Now, all eyes are on who will succeed Amorim as manager. The club is reportedly in discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, and Ruud van Nistelrooy about taking the reins until the end of the season. Solskjaer seems to be the front-runner for the role.",
      "The Norwegian departed the club back in 2021 after a three-year stint at the helm. With United set to play tonight (Wednesday), U18 head coach Darren Fletcher will temporarily take charge of the squad for the match.",
      "He'll be supported by former defender Jonny Evans, who is poised to return just months after stepping down from his position as loans manager, along with Travis Binnon and Alan Wright.",
      "Updating on the hunt for a new manager, Fletcher stated: \"I've had a conversation and the focus was on this game and we'll speak after the game\"\"I've got a game to prepare, training session to organise, speak to players. The focus has been on the Burnley match and we'll speak after the game\"When queried about whether he'd like the job on a more permanent basis, he responded: \"Honestly, it's not something I've thought about.",
      "\"That discussion is for after the game. It's all happened so quickly, all my concentration and efforts are going on Burnley.\"",
      "Reflecting on managing United, he added: \"It's surreal, it's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team. I didn't think in my wildest dreams that was something that could happen.",
      "\"To lead out a team is an amazing honour and something I'm really proud of. Not in the circumstances I expected, that's something that doesn't sit easy with me, but I've got a job to do and will think of the honour and pride.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson once tried to persuade Pep Guardiola to take over as Manchester United manager during a secret meeting between the pair. In the 13 years since the legendary Scot retired, the club has attempted - largely in vain - to fill the vast void his departure left behind.",
      "Six permanent managers have come and gone in that time, the latest being Ruben Amorim, who was relieved of his duties on Monday. But much of that upheaval might have been avoided had Ferguson succeeded in convincing Guardiola to take the reins from him at Old Trafford.",
      "The pair met at a restaurant in New York in 2012, ahead of what would be Ferguson's final season in charge of the Red Devils. At the time, Guardiola had just embarked on a sabbatical after a hugely successful four-year spell at Barcelona.",
      "Although Ferguson had yet to formally decide when he would retire, he effectively offered the Spaniard the opportunity to succeed him in the United hot seat. Reflecting on the encounter in 2014, Guardiola joked that he was not entirely sure he had even been offered the job, citing the language barrier - and Ferguson's famously thick Glaswegian accent.",
      "\"He invited me to [a] super restaurant and we had a very, very good time,\" he recalled. \"My English [was] not so good [and] Sir Alex spoke a little bit quickly, I sometimes had a problem understanding him.",
      "\"That's why I didn't understand if I received an offer or not,\" he laughed. \"It was a friendly dinner, like always with me when I started as a coach, he was so, so gentle, and we spent a very, very good time together.\"",
      "Ultimately, the offer was futile. In January 2013, it was announced that Guardiola would take over as Bayern Munich boss at the end of the season.",
      "\"I couldn't make him any direct proposal to [Guardiola] because retirement was not on my agenda at that point,\" Ferguson wrote of their meeting in his 2015 book Leading.",
      "\"He had already won an enviable number of trophies with Barcelona... and I admired him greatly. I asked Pep to phone me before he accepted an offer from another club, but he didn't and wound up joining Bayern Munich in July 2013.\"",
      "Instead, on another of Ferguson's recommendations, United turned to David Moyes, whose disastrous tenure ended in his dismissal just 10 months later. Guardiola would eventually make his way to Manchester after three years in Bavaria - only it was the blue half of the city that secured his services.",
      "Since 2016, Guardiola's Manchester City have run roughshod over the Premier League, collecting six titles as well as two FA Cups and the Champions League in 2023. They also became the first club in the competition's history to win four in a row - and remain the only side to have amassed more than 100 points in a single season.",
      "By contrast, United have floundered throughout the decade since Guardiola arrived on English shores. The club have slipped completely out of the title picture and finished the 2024/25 campaign in a record-low 15th place.",
      "That dismal state of affairs, compounded by growing tensions between the manager and the board in recent months, ultimately led to Amorim's departure earlier this week. Darren Fletcher has been placed in temporary charge, with former head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reportedly in the frame to take over as an interim successor while the search for a permanent appointment continues.",
      "It means that since Ferguson's retirement, United could, by the start of next season, have cycled through 13 different managers - an extraordinary rate of turnover for a club once defined by stability and long-term vision. Across the city, the man Sir Alex hoped would inherit his throne has instead built a neighbouring dynasty, turning a rival into the dominant force of an era.",
      "Football history often hinges on fine margins, fleeting conversations and missed opportunities. For United, that dinner in New York may stand as the ultimate sliding doors moment.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Darren Fletcher has no intention of asking his former teammates, now media pundits, to go easy on his Manchester United team, despite the escalating criticism under Ruben Amorim's management. In a recent press conference, Amorim suggested that even club executives were swayed by critiques from figures like Gary Neville.",
      "The club's ex-right-back is among a group of United legends who have voiced their opinions in their media roles, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes also being notably critical. These criticisms have dented the confidence of some players and caused rifts between the dressing room and some United veterans, but Fletcher believes those currently donning the shirt should welcome the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can't ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher commented about the critical pundits he once played alongside. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Former United captain Rio Ferdinand has revealed that a WhatsApp group of former Red Devils players including Fletcher, has been buzzing with messages since the former midfielder's appointment as caretaker boss.",
      "\"I'm really excited to see him, I mean the Man United [ex-players] WhatsApp group is popping off as you can imagine with congratulations and good luck messages to Fletch,\" he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"I think he'll be ejecting himself [from the group], or won't be answering. Let me just check and see if he's answered already because he ain't been as active since he's been the Under-18s manager.",
      "\"Let me just see. Fletch, where are you? Nope. You've got Youngy, Edwin van der Sar, Anders Lindergaard and myself all wishing him good luck. I think [the good luck messages] will be coming in more and more over the next couple of minutes.\"",
      "Whilst the relentless criticism following a series of poor performances and disappointing campaigns has been viewed internally as harmful, Fletcher flipped the narrative and suggested players should appreciate the backing they get inside Old Trafford.",
      "Fans have seldom turned against the side despite their troubles, with Fletcher highlighting that this wouldn't necessarily be the situation elsewhere given United's recent struggles, including sixth, eighth and 15th-place finishes across three of the last four campaigns.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" Fletcher remarked.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be welcomed back to Manchester United with open arms by senior players. The club legend, who led United to third and second-place finishes during his three years at the helm, is a contender to be re-appointed until the end of the season following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Solskjaer and another United favourite, Michael Carrick, who was sacked as Middlesbrough boss in the summer, are understood to have been sounded out for the role. The potential return of Solskjaer has raised eyebrows.",
      "The Norwegian was sacked in November 2021 but has maintained his bridges with United and even gave a farewell interview to club media. Those bridges seemingly extend to the players, with The Guardian reporting that Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire would welcome his appointment on a temporary basis.",
      "It was Solskjaer who signed Fernandes in January 2020, with the Portuguese star widely regarded as the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Fernandes made his feelings clear on Solskjaer shortly before his dismissal following a heavy defeat at Watford.",
      "\"It was not as good as we want but it was good overall. No one was expecting us… Top four probably but not second place and the closest ones to fight with City.",
      "\"For me, he's doing a really good job and it's been a big improvement on the team since he arrived. We're still dropping points at home and it's not good enough and we know that but it’s not only the coach's fault.\"",
      "Another player who may welcome the return of Solskjaer is Luke Shaw, who made more than 100 appearances under the Treble winner. Meanwhile, Marcus Rashford, who scored 55 goals in 135 games under Solskjaer, could now have a future at the club following the exit of Amorim, who had completely frozen out the England striker and sanctioned his loan move to Barcelona.",
      "Under-18s boss Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team at Burnley on Wednesday and possibly against Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday. Speaking ahead of the trip to Turf Moor, the club stalwart said: \"It's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team. I don't even think it’s in my wildest dreams that that was something that could potentially happen.",
      "\"I think even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that, but to lead out a team is an amazing honour, and something I'm really proud to do.",
      "\"Not in the circumstances I expected it to happen, so that obviously is something that doesn’t sit quite easy with me. But I've got a job to do, and I've got to lead the team, and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.\"",
      "Asked if he was interested in the job beyond this interim spell, Fletcher said: \"Honestly, it's not something I've thought about. I'm focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.",
      "\"There's been that much going on, it's all happened so quickly. All my concentration and efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley. I know that sounds like a generic answer but it is what it is.\"",

      "The 40-year-old was given his marching orders by Plymouth on New Year's Eve in 2024 and has since focused his energies on punditry. It marked the second consecutive managerial role where England's former record goalscorer found himself shown the door following his dismissal from Birmingham the previous year.",
      "His tenures at Derby and DC United concluded on better terms, with Rooney choosing to resign and departing by mutual consent, respectively. The Old Trafford legend hasn't abandoned his coaching ambitions entirely though, and spoke candidly about his future during a recent cameo on The Smith Bros YouTube channel.",
      "\"I would, I definitely would if the right thing came up,\" he revealed when quizzed about a potential managerial comeback. \"But I wouldn't put myself in situations like [when I lived] in DC, lived in Plymouth, lived in Birmingham, lived away and missed a lot of my kids' football and stuff.",
      "\"That means it has to be the right thing, and for it to be the right thing, and realistic as well. With the four jobs I've done, is that gonna come up? Which I doubt, so [a comeback becomes more complicated]..\"",
      "Rooney proceeded to acknowledge various obstacles that hampered his previous appointments. He specifically highlighted Plymouth's financial limitations, alongside the intense media spotlight that comes with his high-profile status.",
      "However, he fronted up to those challenges and said: \"At the minute, I'm happy just doing the TV work.\"",
      "As for other sporting ventures that might lure him back into competing, boxing could be a contender. Rooney dabbled in the sport as a pastime from an early age and hinted at a possible step into the ring, provided the price was right.",
      "\"I think I've missed the boat on that one,\" he said before pondering the idea further. \"Do you know what? I'd never say never with it. It depends what offer's on the table.\"",
      "Rooney was previously rumoured to face off against influencer Jake Paul, who was recently knocked out by ex-world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. Fans will also recall his notorious knockout loss to ex-team-mate Phil Bardsley in a home video of their sparring session that went viral in 2015.",

      "Darren Fletcher will be in the Manchester United dugout when they face Burnley after the sacking of head coach Ruben Amorim. The new interim manager returned to Old Trafford in 2020 as a coach, having battled illness throughout his illustrious career.",
      "With Amorim shown the exit door after just 14 months in charge, the reins have been handed to former United star Fletcher in the interim. His side face Burnley on Wednesday evening.",
      "It is expected that a caretaker manager will soon be appointed for the remainder of the current campaign. But this moment marks a significant turnaround for Fletcher, who suffered from chronic bowel disease during his career and retired in 2019, fearing a return to playing during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Fletcher first joined United's youth setup as an 11-year-old, and despite almost signing for Newcastle at 15, he remained at Carrington. From there, he quickly made an impression on Sir Alex Ferguson's first team.",
      "He soon became renowned for his ability in big games, and at Old Trafford, he won five Premier League titles, a Champions League and an FA Cup, among other honours.",
      "However, in 2011, he was diagnosed with chronic bowel disease, ulcerative colitis. He lost almost three stone in weight when he was taken seriously ill and later underwent surgery.",
      "But Fletcher revealed that he had actually been suffering from the ailment since 2008, but chose not to disclose his illness. He said in 2014: \"I stayed silent until about 2011 or 2012 because it's not something you generally talk about, the symptoms of ulcerative colitis.",
      "\"My close family and friends knew, but nobody else knew at the club. I found it difficult, making up stories for reasons why I wasn't at training, why I was looking ill, why I was feeling ill and why I was rushing off to the bathroom.",
      "\"Basically lying to people's faces. Once I started talking about it and making it public knowledge, it was such a relief; it was the best thing I did.\"",
      "After surgery in January 2013, he bounced back in miraculous fashion, returning to action in a 3-0 win against Aston Villa in December of that year. He was even named vice-captain under Louis van Gaal in 2014.",
      "The former Scotland captain left United in 2015 for West Brom. He played there until 2017 when he joined Stoke City. Two years later, he began studying for his coaching qualifications after leaving Stoke.",
      "When the pandemic arrived, Fletcher acknowledged that he probably wouldn't play again because his condition would have left him at a higher risk from Covid, and his career on the pitch came to an end.",
      "After this tough call, he returned to United to coach the under-16,s and the rest is history. He became the under-18s coach just last year and will now take charge of the senior side in the interim after Amorim's dismissal.",

      "Gareth Southgate has unsurprisingly been named as a potential candidate to succeed Ruben Amorim as Manchester United manager. The Portuguese boss was given his marching orders on Monday, bringing an end to his turbulent 14-month tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "United have appointed club legend Darren Fletcher as interim boss while they search for their seventh permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013. Southgate, who last managed England in the Euro 2024 final, has been consistently linked with the United job since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake in the club in February 2024.",
      "Last October, it was rumoured that Southgate was considering putting his name in the mix during Amorim's reign. Now, reports have resurfaced linking him with the vacancy, although there are suggestions he has concerns about whether he'll be granted the necessary time to build his squad.",
      "Given the controversy surrounding Amorim's failed 3-4-2-1 formation, it seems unlikely that Southgate would adopt the same setup if he takes on the United job. The wing-back experiment could well be finished, despite Southgate finding considerable success with a similar structure at the 2018 World Cup and in his last tournament with the Three Lions.",
      "Southgate is more likely to opt for a 4-3-2-1 or a 4-3-3 formation, although his teams are typically defined by core principles rather than specific formations. His tactical approach largely focuses on shielding his defence with a double pivot positioned behind the No.10, favouring structured games over high-intensity pressing.",
      "After initially spending time on the bench following his move from Royal Antwerp in the summer, Lammens has established himself as United's first-choice goalkeeper and appears to be the long-term No.1. The Belgian has settled in well and it seems unlikely that Southgate would prioritise recruiting a new goalkeeper, although his former dependable England shot-stopper Jordan Pickford may be of interest.",
      "When fit, Lisandro Martinez is one of United's most crucial players at the heart of the defence, thanks to his ball-playing skills and defensive leadership. Southgate would relish the opportunity to pair him in central defence with Marc Guehi, whose contract at Crystal Palace expires in the summer.",
      "United would need a stroke of luck to secure Guehi's signature, with recent links to Manchester City and Liverpool. However, Southgate has built a strong rapport with the defender, having made him a regular starter for England. Another of Southgate's trusted England defenders, Luke Shaw, is likely to take up the left-back position.",
      "This leaves Tino Livramento, another England international, as an ideal signing at right-back. The Newcastle defender, who has already been linked with a move to Old Trafford, is highly rated and would be a versatile addition in defence, capable of also covering the opposite flank.",
      "Notably absent from this trio are captain Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo. Fernandes has served United well, but has previously been linked with leaving United to sign a lucrative contract in Saudi Arabia. Summer recruit Matheus Cunha could step into the No. 10 role vacated by Fernandes.",
      "Southgate gave Mainoo his England debut and could rotate him with Cunha and Mason Mount, depending on the opposition. Mount embodied Southgate's style of football on the international stage.",
      "Elliot Anderson, who could either join Mainoo in the pivot or play as a lone six with Mount and Cunha further forward, has emerged as one of United's top targets in recent months. Now a regular starter for both England and Nottingham Forest, Anderson could be the signing United have needed to bolster their midfield.",
      "However, the energetic Forest star could fetch a sum as high as £100m in the summer, with the likes of City also reportedly interested in him.",
      "Harry Kane and Gareth Southgate enjoyed an incredible relationship during their years working together for England. Kane, who is enjoying another prolific season at Bayern Munich, insists he's happy in Germany, but Southgate being in charge at United may be the push he needs to return to the Premier League and break Alan Shearer's goal-scoring record.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been one of United's better players since he signed in the summer, operating from his favoured right flank with Amad playing the role of back-up. That presents a huge opportunity for Marcus Rashford to return to the fold on the left flank after his falling out with former boss Amorim forced him out on loan to Aston Villa and now Barcelona.",
      "It's still unclear whether Barcelona will activate their option-to-buy clause at the end of this season. Should Rashford return to his boyhood club, Southgate would be the ideal man to help the forward thrive at Old Trafford once again.",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy is OUT of the running to take interim charge at Manchester United until the end of the season. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick now remain as the top two candidates to take over.",
      "United's chief executive, Omar Berrada, and director of football, Jason Wilcox, spoke to both contenders on Tuesday. They will now meet with each of them again before deciding which of the pair will return to Old Trafford. Darren Fletcher is currently in situ in a caretaker role.",
      "Carrick is receiving serious consideration, having previously been interim boss and done a decent job in his first permanent role at Middlesbrough. Solskjaer, however, emerged as the leading contender after being spotted in Cheshire on Tuesday.",
      "Both have previously taken charge of the team in similar circumstances. Solskjaer did so in December 2018 after United sacked Jose Mourinho and won his first eight matches across all competitions.",
      "The Norwegian manager then signed a three-year contract three months into his return. His tenure ended in November 2021, and his sacking led Carrick to take charge of three matches.",
      "United appointed Ralf Rangnick for the remainder of the season, rather than retaining their former player. Carrick soon left his role as first-team coach under the German coach.",
      "His managerial career continued the following year after being appointed by Middlesbrough. After two-and-a-half seasons with the Championship club, they parted company last summer.",
      "Van Nistelrooy vacated his most recent position weeks later after leaving Leicester City by mutual consent following their relegation from the Premier League. The legendary striker also spent just over a year coaching PSV in the Netherlands, winning the Dutch Cup, having previously worked in their academy.",
      "He then returned to United as an assistant coach under Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2024. Following his compatriot's departure mere months later, he was at the helm for three matches before Ruben Amorim's arrival. However, he won't be offered the opportunity to go again at Old Trafford.",
      "Solskjaer is the most recently employed of the three, having taken charge of Besiktas in January last year. However, the Turkish team sacked him earlier this season after losing in the Conference League qualifiers. United's treble-winning striker has the most managerial experience among their options, having taken charge of over 200 matches across two spells at Molde in Norway, as well as a brief stint with Cardiff City during their sole season in the Premier League.",
      "Darren Fletcher will manage his first match on Wednesday when United are away at Burnley. Speaking before the game, he explained: \"I've had a conversation [about the future] and the focus was on this game. I've got a game to prepare for, a training session to organise, and I've been speaking to the players. The focus has been on the Burnley match, and we'll speak after the game.\"",
      "United then face Brighton in the third round of the FA Cup this weekend, for which the Scotsman is likely to remain in charge. Carrick or Solskjaer's first match back at Old Trafford looks set to be the Manchester derby against City.",
      "The games do not get any easier for Man United and their potential interim boss. Their final fixture of January is a trip to league leaders Arsenal.",

      "Throughout his Manchester United tenure, Ruben Amorim made it clear he wasn't to be trifled with. The head coach has been sacked after just 14 months, with more stories from his brief time in charge now coming to the fore now that he has been given his marching orders.",
      "Amorim's relationship with Lisandro Martinez has been in focus following the dismissal. He is said to have had a heated confrontation with the Argentine during a training session, with Martinez's omission from starting line-ups believed to be the focus, though the pair are said to have left the exchange without particular ill-will.",
      "Indeed, Amorim even gave the captain's armband to Martinez for his final few games, with regular skipper Bruno Fernandes injured, in what has been described as a show of respect to the World Cup winner. Still, we saw earlier in Amorim's reign that he could be a harsh taskmaster, going as far as banning five of United's players from first team training.",
      "In July, members of United's so-called 'bomb squad' were kept apart from the rest of Amorim's squad. According to reports at the time from The Athletic, the quintet of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were asked to only report for training after 5pm, after Amorim and the other senior players had left Carrington.",
      "The group were also reportedly instructed to attend the training complex while the rest of the group were away for a pre-season friendly with Leeds United. However, there has been a way back for those who have clashed with the boss.",
      "While Rashford, Antony and Sancho left on loan, and Garnacho made a permanent switch to Chelsea, Malacia has been reintegrated after no buyer was found over the summer. The Dutch left-back made the bench for the first time this season in October and played his first minutes for United in 11 months when he came off the bench against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Similarly, Martinez was offered a way back in despite his confrontation with the boss. However, Amorim's inner disciplinarian - coupled with his willingness to vocally call out those at the club in his comments to the press - may have combined to seal his fate.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" Amorim said after the 1-1 draw at Leeds which would prove to be his final match in charge.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "It wasn't the first time he spoke his mind in a manner which some might have considered to have gone too far. In August, after a Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby Town, he almost dared the higher-ups to sack him.",
      "\"I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I'm not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" he said. \"But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",
      "As the fallout from Amorim's exit continues, plenty of theories are sure to surface when it comes to the straw that broke the camel's back. Still, throughout his 14 months in charge, he could prove challenging to deal with in a manner which might have mattered less if United were flying up the table.",
      "Ultimately, the club claimed they decided a change was needed in order to \"give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish\". Only they will know how big a part that motivation played in their decision.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wednesday will see Darren Fletcher become the fifth player from the school of Sir Alex Ferguson to manage Manchester United for at least one game. Fletcher, 41, has been installed as the club's interim manager following the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday.",
      "The former United midfielder, who came through their academy before making 342 appearances for the first-team, will lead the Red Devils in their trip to Burnley, joined by ex-team-mate Jonny Evans as part of his coaching staff. Fletcher has no experience of first-team management but he's been learning his trade in the world of coaching over the past few years.",
      "In July, the Scot was appointed as head coach of United's under-18 side. Fletcher previously worked in assistant roles under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag, and became the club's first ever technical director in 2021.",
      "Having been diagnosed with a chronic bowel disease in 2011 and been forced to stop playing temporarily, the five-time Premier League winner delved into coaching. A decade and a half later and he'll be on the touchline as United's interim boss.",
      "Fletcher joins Solskjaer, Ryan Giggs, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy as those to have played under Ferguson and gone on to stand where he did for the best part of 27 years. But not everyone is cut out for management in the long term, Ferguson has warned.",
      "In 2017, the legendary former United manager spoke to West Bromwich Albion about Fletcher's prospects as a coach. \"I think his long-term position will be as a coach,\" Ferguson explained.",
      "\"Maybe even management. He's got the presence, he's got the sacrifice. When you become a manager, Martin (interviewer), it's a sacrifice.",
      "\"You give up your family life, which I did. I scouted my own players, I went to games every week - midweek and everywhere. That's the kind of sacrifice and you need to have the type of wife who understands that.\"",
      "Will Darren Fletcher be a success as interim manager? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "While coaching at youth level brings its own pressures, nothing compares to a top job, especially at Old Trafford. Still, managing United is Fletcher's dream job.",
      "\"When I take my first steps on the management ladder, the goal is to become Manchester United manager because that's the pinnacle for me,\" he told the UTD Podcast in 2019. \"Nothing tops that, nothing's bigger.\"",
      "The road to becoming United's full-time manager may well start at Turf Moor. Currently, Fletcher is also expected to be remain in charge for Sunday's FA Cup tie at home to Brighton.",

      "Whether United look to bring in a new face this month or not, the squad does need work. Plenty of players are being linked with a move to Old Trafford. There has also been an update on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's imminent arrival...",
      "Marcus Rashford isn't expected to return to United after being bombed out of the club by Amorim in the summer. The England international and teammates Jadon Sancho, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund were all permitted to leave on loan after losing their spot in Amorim's plans.",

But according to the Daily Mail, the 49-year-old is being considered by United as someone that could take charge until the end of the campaign, after Ruben Amorim was sacked.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who previously spent almost three years as United's manager between 2018 and 2021, is among the frontrunners on the shortlist alongside Van Nistelrooy.",
      "Should Van Nistelrooy be given the United job, it would be his first managerial role since a disastrous seven-month stint at Leicester last season. Van Nistelrooy took over from Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium in November 2024, but won just five of his 27 Premier League matches in charge. The Foxes ended up finishing 18th, 10 points adrift of safety and became the first top-flight club to go nine games without scoring at home.",
      "Van Nistelrooy's record at Leicester was dismal, it's safe to say, and it hasn't convinced many of his managerial capabilities. Someone who wasn't convinced was Odsonne Edouard, who spent last season on loan at the Foxes from Crystal Palace. Edouard, 27, made six appearances under Cooper before being completely cast aside by Van Nistelrooy. The Frenchman made the bench just once under the ex-PSV Eindhoven boss.",
      "After finding his form with Lens this season, scoring seven times in 14 Ligue 1 matches, Edouard delivered a brutal verdict on Van Nistelrooy back in October and said he is not a 'great coach'.",
      "\"Being a great striker doesn't necessarily mean being a great coach,\" Edouard told L'Equipe. \"After training, I would do an even harder session with my fitness coach. I didn't give up.",
      "\"Leicester, it had a professional impact on me. I don't really have any reasons. At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn't work out with Van Nistelrooy.",
      "\"I didn't get along well with Van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.\"",

He won three and drew the other of his four matches, with two of those victories coming against Cooper's Leicester in the Carabao Cup and Premier League. Van Nistelrooy's other win came against PAOK in the Europa League, while the draw came at home to Chelsea.",

      "Darren Fletcher won't tell his former teammates now working in the media to go easy on his Manchester United team, despite the criticism being levelled at players and the club being raised under Ruben Amorim. In his press conference broadside at club officials on Sunday, Amorim suggested that even executives were influenced by criticism from the likes of Gary Neville.",
      "The club's former right-back is one of a cohort of United greats who have waded in on the club in their media roles, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes also heavily critical. Those attacks have damaged the confidence of some players and caused divisions between the dressing room and some United greats, but Fletcher believes those now wearing the shirt should embrace the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can’t ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher said of the critical pundits he played with. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Although the withering attacks on a string of disappointing performances and underwhelming seasons have been seen internally as damaging, Fletcher turned the equation on its head and said players should be grateful for the support they receive inside Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters have rarely turned on the team despite their struggles, with Fletcher pointing out that wouldn't be the case everywhere given the struggles United have endured in recent years, with finishes of sixth, eighth and 15th in three of the previous four seasons.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "The irony of Manchester United's new power structure appointing Ruben Amorim as the club's first head coach in November 2024 is that a few months earlier, his name hadn't really been in the frame at all. That was the summer when Liverpool considered appointing Amorim, only to opt for Arne Slot amid concerns over the Portuguese's system, his stubbornness in playing it and how the squad would fit. Those concerns were cast aside at Old Trafford later in the year.",
      "But for a few heady, confusing weeks in the summer of 2024, change was in the air at United, too. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had decided to sack Erik ten Hag and contenders to replace him were lined up on the catwalk. Then Ten Hag won the FA Cup final, United dithered and the Dutchman stayed, new contract, pay rise and all.",
      "Before that, Ratcliffe spoke to potential replacements as United scoured the market. They met with Thomas Tuchel in Monaco and the German was right at the top of the list of likely appointments, should they have gone through with the decision to dispense with Ten Hag.",
      "There were also talks with Premier League managers, as Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Roberto De Zerbi were all considered. However, there was little indication that Amorim was part of the conversation before the Ibiza summit, which led to Ten Hag staying.",
      "That decision was reversed within four months, with no improvement in results under the Dutchman. As United looked for a replacement this time, Amorim was high on the shortlist. For all the reservations of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and his colleagues at Anfield, the Sporting head coach's stock was high.",
      "Perhaps the switch to Amorim and a coach with such a unique style of play can be attributed to chief executive Omar Berrada settling into the job. Berrada was particularly taken by Amorim's personality and charisma. Speaking to the BBC in March of this year, Ratcliffe explained the decision to stick with Ten Hag as one made at \"short notice\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, we are a consensus organisation,\" he said. \"So there's a collection of us who make decisions. It's not just me that makes the decision, it involves that management team.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik the management team hadn't been in place more than five minutes. Omar [Berrada] had only just arrived, Jason [Wilcox] had not been there terribly long, so we didn't really have the management team in place for very long to make… it was a very difficult decision to make at short notice.\"",
      "That consensus was lacking when Amorim was appointed. Berrada and Ratcliffe might have been on board with the decision, but Wilcox needed convincing and Ashworth's doubts never dissipated. Having insisted that a football structure would make a decision on a style of play, Ratcliffe turned to a head coach who was unique in this department.",
      "What does that tell us about the next search for a head coach, now that Amorim has gone? The structure is more settled, with Ashworth having also left. Berrada and Wilcox are the key figures, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell on the rise. Ratcliffe will again be involved.",
      "The management team that Ratcliffe discussed should be able to make the right decision this time, but they will be under pressure to do so. Given the names under consideration in June 2024, the decision to appoint Amorim felt like a change in strategy. Maybe it warns us to expect the unexpected as United consider their options this time around.",

      "It has been a whirlwind couple of days for Manchester United following their draw at Leeds on Sunday lunchtime. Ruben Amorim made his thoughts on the Ineos decision-makers crystal clear after the game, was fired for said outburst and Darren Fletcher has taken charge.",
      "The former United midfielder and U18s coach will be looking to settle all of the noise surrounding the club with a straightforward victory against Burnley on Wednesday night. Scott Parker's relegation-threatened side have not won in their last 11 matches but as the Wolves game proved, no match will be easy for this squad.",
      "It is expected Fletcher will make some changes to the starting line-up tonight - chief of which would be to revert to a four-at-the-back system. Sticking with a three would be a rogue decision considering the fallout which led to Amorim's sacking. But while the 4-3-3 could be considered when players are back from injury and the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), a 4-2-3-1 seems more likely when they make the short trip to Turf Moor tonight.",
      "Out of the defensive line that started at Elland Road, we expect Leny Yoro to be the one who misses out. Ayden Heaven switched off for the Leeds goal at the weekend but United will hope this is a blip in an otherwise stellar run of form for the Reds' defender.",
      "Fletcher would love to call upon Bruno Fernandes to play alongside Casemiro in the holding role but while he could be part of the matchday squad, he will have his minutes managed. Therefore, Manuel Ugarte will most likely keep his place in the squad.",
      "While Fletcher's son Jack has featured for United in recent weeks and is being considered for the matchday squad alongside his brother Tyler, it may be too bold a call to start him in his first match in interim charge. In attacking midfield, Patrick Dorgu will be keen to make a point at right wing.",
      "He did well there when Amorim experimented with four-at-the-back against Newcastle. The worry for Dorgu is, when all players are back, he is not going to be first choice in that position which will be a concern.",
      "Matheus Cunha should keep his place after a well-taken goal at Leeds and the man who provided the assist, Joshua Zirkzee, should also return to the starting line-up. His future is firmly up in the air and while Mason Mount may take his place ordinarily, Fletcher is unlikely to risk him with a start.",
      "With Zirkzee playing deeper, Benjamin Sesko will undoubtedly lead the line. The 22-year-old desperately needs a goal.",

      "As if Oliver Glasner's Premier League CV didn't speak for itself, Manchester United would get a welcome boost in the transfer market should they hire him. At least in principle, that is, given it only looks like a matter of time before Marc Guehi leaves Crystal Palace.",
      "Ruben Amorim's dismissal on Monday has reopened the forum regarding who will succeed him as United's next long-term boss. Glasner was cryptic when recently quizzed about him being the favourite to take over at Old Trafford, though that may not materialise until the summer when his contract expires.",
      "He isn't the only one, either, given Guehi is in an identical position regarding the expiration date of his terms at Selhurst Park. The defender was widely expected to join Liverpool on transfer deadline day in the summer, only for negotiations to collapse at the 11th hour.",
      "A move could now come to fruition this month following a hint from FA Cup-winner Glasner himself. Until recently, Palace had held firm in their stance that Guehi, who is now understood to be in Manchester City's sights as well, would not be allowed to leave midway through the campaign; however, that hardened position appears to have softened.",
      "Speaking about the prospect of Guehi leaving in January, Glasner recently said: \"There’s the situation that the contract ends in the summer and if somebody is coming, there will be a moment when the club says, 'Now the financial issue is more important than the sport issue.'",
      "\"We have to do it and try to get the best. That’s why I’m always saying, 'I don’t know.' Because this is different. “There will be a threshold where the club has to say [sell].",
      "\"If the player says, ‘I want to leave’ and the money is above the threshold, it will happen. I’m not so naive not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.\"",
      "Except City may not be the only Manchester giant to weigh in this month, and United have their own need for such an asset. Not to mention the bonus enjoyment those at Old Trafford would feel from blocking their nemeses' efforts to reinforce.",
      "Guehi is the real prize, however. He brings a commanding England international presence in defence at a potentially hefty discount. Moreover, the Eagles skipper would add some of the much-needed leadership qualities that have been lacking at Old Trafford for some time.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's regime has signed defensive talents like Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, but all are either too young or the wrong profile to be considered dressing room leaders. Harry Maguire has had his chance at the captaincy and is now hampered by fitness issues, similar to those of Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, who haven't been present enough to be considered reliable.",

But when it comes to appointing a permanent successor to Amorim, the United hierarchy are looking for someone who has experience of managing in the Premier League.",
      "According to David Ornstein of The Athletic, after appointing both Erik ten Hag and then Amorim, who both had no Premier League experience, having someone who knows England's top-flight well is going to be crucial. That could rule out the likes of Luis Enrique and Zinedine Zidane, who have been mentioned as a possible long-term replacement for Amorim.",
      "The former Real Madrid manager has long been linked with a move to United despite always publicly distancing himself from managing in England. Another manager who has been linked with the vacancy is Oliver Glasner, who is out of contract in the summer.",

      "A fresh era for Manchester United starts this evening when Darren Fletcher takes charge of the Reds for their trip to Burnley in the Premier League. The Scot has moved up to the United first team following the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday morning.",
      "Unfortunately for Fletcher, he has limited options to choose from to try and get a much-needed victory tonight. Amad, Noussair Mazraoui and Bryan Mbeumo remain unavailable due to their participation at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). As for injuries, captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount trained on Tuesday and are available tonight.",
      "Their minutes will be managed as they return to full match fitness but it is a boost for the Reds to have two players in such good form back available. Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are out due to injury issues and Kobbie Mainoo faces a late fitness test.",
      "Our United writers have had their say on how they think United should line up tonight:",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "First thing's first, let's forget about a back three. It would be quite the plot twist if Fletcher decided he wanted to stick with Amorim's doomed formation. That means Dalot at right-back and Shaw at left-back, while I would stick with Heaven and Martinez at centre-back.",
      "Returning players in midfield means Ugarte can drop to the bench. Casemiro can play the holding role with Fernandes and Mount ahead of him, although there are doubts over whether either can make 90 minutes.",
      "Dorgu can play on the right wing, as he did successfully against Newcastle, with Cunha on the left, and Sesko is through the middle.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "It makes sense now the Amorim era has ended to revert to a four-man defence. I would start Fernandes. United need a lift after everything that has happened over the past few days and seeing the captain return would give them just that.",
      "The chances of him lasting 90 minutes are very slim but it would set the tone. Playing him deeper could be the safe option and recalling Zirkzee, who provided a great assist for Cunha at Leeds, could be a wise option.",

      "Manchester United are on the hunt for a new manager once again following the sacking of Ruben Amorim, as the hierarchy ponder their next move.",
      "While Darren Fletcher is in post for now, Man United could turn to the familiar face of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who enjoyed a famous interim period with the club before landing the role as manager on a full-time basis.",
      "Reports surrounding talks over a short-term deal for the Norwegian coach could see him 'back at the wheel' once more, while the 52-year-old was spotted back in Cheshire, where he has owned a £4m home.",
      "The property is based in Alderley Edge, where plenty of famous stars have decided to settle - including Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Coleen and Wayne Rooney, while Victoria and David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo also lived in the area in the past.",
      "Solskjaer bought his property, which was originally a cottage, and transformed it into an \"eco mansion\", which began building in 2007.",
      "It took some time for the former Manchester United man to move in with his family, having spent time in Norway after his playing career came to an end.",
      "That had led to him putting it up on the market, but when it wasn't sold, reports claimed that he rented it out to Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Solskjaer eventually moved into the property fully in 2019, when returning to Old Trafford, with the mansion featuring 3.4 acres of land around it.",
      "When put on the market back in 2016, the brochure provided by estate agents described the features of the property, which said: \"[The property] is an impressive contemporary style recently constructed detached family residence in extensive grounds of approximately 3.4 acres with impressive leisure complex with pool.",
      "\"[It] is a charming quiet, cobbled road on the outskirts of Alderley Edge enjoying a delightful rural setting. The village centre which is within a few minutes drive offers an excellent range of shopping, educational and recreational facilities with a wealth of quality cafes and fine restaurants.\"",
      "The estate agent added: \"[The home] enjoys extensive mature grounds surrounding the property with sweeping lawns, mature trees and shrubs with open views beyond.",
      "\"Natural wood electrically operated double gates to the front where a sweeping gravel driveway provides excellent parking facilities and leads to an attached garage.\"",
      "There is also a pool room in the house, along with a media room, similar to those seen in some footballer's houses that will often feature cinema rooms.",
      "With Solskjaer believed to still own the property, and spotted back in Cheshire, there is a possibility he and his family could move back into the house if he is called in for the interim spell.",
      "For the meantime, he will be watching on with every Man United supporter, as they prepare for an interesting few games ahead under Fletcher.",

      "Former United midfielder Fletcher, who is the current Under 18s coach, will take charge of the team for Wednesday's trip to Burnley, with Jonny Evans returning to the club to assist him.",

      "It's added that United are then poised to confirm an interim solution until the end of the 2025/26 campaign before a permanent replacement for Amorim is named and confirmed in the summer.",
      "Solskjaer has been spotted near his house in Cheshire and would be open to stepping up and helping his former club. He spent almost three years in charge as United's manager before he was sacked in November 2021, winning 91 of his 168 matches and guiding the Reds to a second-place finish in his second full season.",
      "The 52-year-old then spent more than three years out of the managerial game before returning to take charge at Besiktas in January. He ended up helping them to finish fourth in the Turkish Super Lig. However, Solskjaer was axed from his role earlier this season after Besiktas lost in the Conference League play-offs.",
      "Speaking during a Q&A at the Oslo Business Forum in September 2024, Solskjaer said he would answer the call - whenever, wherever - if United approached him to return to the club.",
      "Solskjaer said: \"If the family [United] asks, I would say yes every day of the week. It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people have now, but I would say yes, of course.\"",

The current Crystal Palace boss has emerged as a leading contender for the job after Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday, following a string of disappointing results and a falling out with director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "Glasner has admirers within Old Trafford and is understood to be interested in the job. He is out of contract at Crystal Palace at the end of this season and is set to walk away from Selhurst Park then. The 51-year-old has enjoyed an excellent spell in South London, winning the club's first major honour last season after they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final, although he has also been outspoken about recruitment issues at Palace.",
      "He is one of the favourites to land the United job on a permanent basis, but when asked if people should be putting money on him to take over at Old Trafford, he dodged the question and tried to change the subject. \"I am not allowed to bet. My contract has one paragraph that I am not allowed to bet. And I don’t look at it,\" said Glasner.",
      "“I also cannot give insider information. That would also be breaking my contract. I am Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask more questions about it.\"",

      "Much of the focus at Manchester United right now is on who will replace Ruben Amorim - but that hasn't stopped speculation over potential new signings.",
      "This comes despite Amorim hinting at limited January investment just days before being dismissed. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team for Wednesday's Premier League clash with Burnley, with a successor expected to be named later in the month.",
      "During last year's winter transfer window, United were relatively inactive. Ayden Heaven arrived from Arsenal's academy, followed later by Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The club reportedly have several targets, particularly in midfield, with players like Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson high on their wish-list. Current indications suggest a January splurge is unlikely, particularly with the club spending over £200million on new talent in the summer.",
      "That said, the Red Devils are expected to explore several possibilities, with various areas of the squad in need of bolstering. Here, we examine the latest transfer updates surrounding Old Trafford.",
      "While United may have to wait until the summer to make major investments, more creative deals could still be explored in the interim. One option involves RB Leipzig defender El Chadaille Bitshiabu, with L'Equipe reporting that the Red Devils could propose a loan with an option to buy.",
      "However, they are unlikely to be the only club interested. Bayer Leverkusen are reportedly considering a similar arrangement, Monaco are also in pursuit due to a defensive injury crisis and Lyon are said to be involved as well.",
      "There is a bigger complication, though. Earlier reports from Bild suggest Leipzig are unwilling to allow the young centre-back to leave in January, whether on loan or permanently.",
      "Bitshiabu returned from a hamstring injury in December but has only seen limited action this season. Just three of his five appearances have been in the league, with Castello Lukeba and Willi Orban ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Bitshiabu's team-mate Yan Diomande's impressive start at RB Leipzig has seen him attract attention across Europe too, but a January move away also appears unlikely. Diomande joined Leipzig from Leganes in the summer and has quickly made an impact, notably scoring a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt in early December.",
      "According to The Athletic, United are one of two Premier League clubs interested in him, with Tottenham also reportedly monitoring the Ivorian winger. Leipzig are expected to demand up to £86m, with several unnamed European clubs also showing interest.",
      "Premier League teams have had inconsistent results when signing players from Leipzig in recent windows. Josko Gvardiol and Dominik Szoboszlai have thrived for Manchester City and Liverpool, respectively, but attackers have not been as successful.",
      "The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko, who joined United from the Bundesliga side last window, while Timo Werner and Christopher Nkunku struggled to replicate their Leipzig form at Chelsea. Both forwards were eventually sold at a loss, with Werner returning to Leipzig and Nkunku moving to AC Milan.",

      "Fletcher has been appointed interim head coach at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday and that has left him little time to put together a team to support him in what is his first senior head coach role.",
      "The former United midfielder oversaw a smaller training session on Monday but will step up preparations for the visit to Turf Moor today. Under-21s head coach Travis Binnion and academy coach Alan Wright, who recently joined from Manchester City, will also step up to form part of Fletcher's first-team staff.",
      "Amorim brought an army of coaches with him from Sporting, and they all departed the club on Monday. They include assistant head coach Carlos Fernandes, first-team coaches Adelio Candido and Emanuel Ferro, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The only member of the first-team coaching staff staying at Old Trafford in the wake of Amorim's departure is goalkeeping coach Craig Mawson. The 46-year-old has been at United for six years, having joined the club from Wednesday's opponents Burnley in late 2019.",
      "Evans, who left his role as United's head of loans and pathway just a month ago, could return as part of the first-team coaching staff and might be back in time to be involved against the Clarets. He is expected to stay on until the end of the season.",
      "The centre-back retired at the end of the 2024/25 season after two spells at the club as a player and his knowledge of United is considered valuable. Evans played with Fletcher, who will get a chance to show his credentials this week after stepping up from his role as Under-18s head coach.",
      "Fletcher was a first-team coach under Erik ten Hag and had previously served as the technical director at United. This is his first experience in management, and as a result, the club are weighing up the appointment of a more experienced caretaker until the end of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick among the names in contention.",
      "Solskjaer recently left his job at Besiktas and Carrick is out of work after leaving Middlesbrough. Both have more experience than Fletcher having been in the Old Trafford hotseat before.",
      "Fletcher will hold his first press conference at the later time of 5pm on Tuesday. United sought Premier League approval to push the press conference back, with league guidelines usually insisting press conferences should start no later than 1.30pm the day before the game, or on a Friday if it is a weekend fixture.",
      "Fletcher is keen to get his feet under the table today and sort out the identity of his staff and plans for the trip to Turf Moor, before then undertaking his round of media engagements.",

      "Imagine the memes if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is pictured at Old Trafford in the next week or two, scarf above his head, club crest on his breast pocket and nostalgia in the air once again. It would be a social media field day for opposition supporters.",
      "But that wouldn't necessarily make it the wrong call. In fact, for a club looking to stall its decision on another permanent manager until the end of the season, it might be the really obvious one. And Manchester United have learnt their lesson when it comes to turning Solskjaer from interim to the king of the castle.",
      "This week, Darren Fletcher will get his go. The midfielder with 342 appearances to his name will follow in the footsteps of Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy as former players to get a go in the dugout in recent years.",
      "Fletcher knows the club inside out. He spent 20 years at Old Trafford as a player, has served as technical director, first-team coach, and Under-18s head coach. There isn't a nook or cranny of this place he can't navigate to.",
      "But this is his first time in the hot seat for any club, and it comes at a crucial time. United are three points off fourth and four points off 14th, so while the Champions League is within reach, so is the bottom half of the table. It would be a risk to leave a 41-year-old with no management experience in charge for the second half of the season.",
      "That makes someone with experience all the more appealing and Solskjaer ticks that box. For all the criticism thrown at the Norwegian, he has managed 471 games, of which 168 were at United. He has added to that experience with seven months in the goldfish bowl of Turkish football with Beşiktaş.",
      "He left that role in August and is available again. Solskjaer would be interested in returning to United in a caretaker role and his name is under consideration as chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox consider their next move.",
      "Solskjaer has experience of lifting a group following a mid-season sacking. He inherited a squad relieved to see the back of Jose Mourinho in December 2018, so the circumstances are a little different, but he showed his light-touch approach can pay immediate dividends.",
      "He won his first eight games as interim boss, and lost only one of his first 17, culminating in that magical night in Paris in March 2019. That made his appointment as a permanent boss a fait accompli. In hindsight, it was almost certainly a mistake, although his reign wasn't the disaster it is often portrayed as, and it stacks up well against what has followed since.",
      "Solskjaer's win rate of 54% is almost identical to Erik ten Hag's but is comfortably better than Ralf Rangnick's and Ruben Amorim's. He also guided United to second in 2020/21, reaching the Europa League final and the League Cup semi-final.",
      "The failure to get over the line and win a trophy was probably rightly held against Solskjaer. He lacked something that the very best managers have at the highest level. That runner-up finish also has an asterisk next to it, with that season played out in empty stadiums, which seemed to suit United.",
      "But it's also true that the progress he felt was coming was destabilised by the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. It forced Solskjaer to rip up the tactical framework he had built. Solskjaer would never criticise a United legend and Ronaldo's legion of super fans would reject the idea, but it would have been interesting to see the evolution of Solskjaer's team without his signing.",
      "We will never know now, and when the end came, it was the right call. Solskjaer had run out of road and United needed a better, more experienced manager in charge. They still do.",
      "That might have to wait, however. It makes sense for United to make an appointment in the summer, when Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, and Oliver Glasner are out of contract at Fulham, Bournemouth, and Crystal Palace, respectively, while Thomas Tuchel could leave England after the World Cup.",
      "The pool of potential head coaches will be greater in the summer and United should be able to land their man without paying compensation. If they need a safe pair of hands until then, Solskjaer's credentials are strong.",

      "Manchester United are on the hunt for a new head coach after parting ways with Ruben Amorim on Monday morning. In a statement, the club wrote: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"",
      "While Darren Fletcher has been named as taking over Amorim's duties for Wednesday's clash with Burnley, it remains to be seen as to whether the club will afford him the rest of the season before appointing a full-time head coach in the summer. Elsewhere, Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have recently been touted as potential caretakers for the rest of 2025/26, with an update on the latter emerging on Tuesday afternoon claiming he had been 'sounded out'.",
      "Here, the MEN looks at all of the names which have been linked with taking up tenure at Manchester United as of recent, as well as the bookmakers' odds...",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is currently favourite to take up tenure at Manchester United. The Norwegian enjoyed a three-year stint with the club between 2018 and 2021 and has already demonstrated that he can hold his own in the Premier League. An interim or caretaker role until season's end is the most likely scenario, but it remains to be seen as to whether that would interest Solskjaer.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has also been linked with being next in line for the United hot seat. The Austrian said of the role in September: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Out of contract at Selhurst Park this summer, a move to United any sooner looks bleak considering Glasner's commitment to the club.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins of the first-team for United's clash with Burnley on Wednesday. However, the club could afford him the rest of the season on an interim basis depending on how he fares this week, as they continue to search for a full-time appointment.",
      "Out of the managerial game since stepping down from the England national team last summer, Gareth Southgate has been linked with a role with the Reds for some time now. It is unknown whether he would be willing to step up in an interim job, or whether a permanent role would solely appeal to him at present.",
      "Enzo Maresca could be set for a return to Premier League management just a week after leaving Chelsea. The Italian head coach has a solid resume with the Blues, including a Europa Conference League title and last summer's Club World Cup win.",
      "An appointment for Thomas Tuchel is highly unlikely at present, considering the German is currently preparing to guide England to glory at the 2026 World Cup. However, his name has been put out there by the bookies.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino has also found himself highlighted as a suitable candidate to guide United to glory. The Argentine has experience in the Premier League with both Chelsea and Tottenham, although is currently tied up with the USA national team ahead of the World Cup.",
      "Michael Carrick has been out of a job since he was sacked by Middlesbrough last summer, and given his past affiliation with the Reds, could work as a caretaker until season's end. He has previously worked in a caretaker role, and will know what is expected by the board.",
      "Barcelona legend, Xavi, is another name which has been mentioned with regard to taking up a head coach role at Old Trafford. The La Liga legend has enjoyed managerial stints at Al Sadd and at the Camp Nou, but has never managed - nor played for - an English team.",
      "Currently in charge of Ipswich, who are third in the Championship standings, Kieran McKenna is also a bit of a longshot for the job. However, given he has previously worked at the club as an assistant to Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer, he could be a good fit should he have his head turned."

      "Potential new Manchester United interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously admitted he knew his sacking at the club was imminent during his final game as the club's permanent boss in 2021.",
      "The former United manager is in line for a shock return to Old Trafford after Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday. It has been over four years since the ex-Reds striker was sacked by United in November 2021 after a disastrous start to the season that culminated in a 4-1 defeat away at relegation-threatened Watford.",
      "Solskjaer had survived until the international break despite heavy defeats to Leicester City and Liverpool, as well as a poor performance in the Manchester derby, but reached the point of no return when his side were humiliated at Vicarage Road.",
      "That match was one of the only times the match-going crowd voiced their anger towards Solskjaer, and he has previously he knew the time was up when his side went in two goals down at half-time.",
      "Speaking to The Athletic in September 2023, he said: “Nobody told me, but I knew at half-time against Watford. We didn’t look like a Man United team; the players weren’t running for each other.",
      "\"At half-time, I told the players it was probably going to be the last time we worked together and to play with pride.",
      "\"We almost turned it around, until Harry Maguire got sent off.”",
      "The Norwegian was not given his marching orders at full-time. However, there was a growing sense that he would lose his job in the aftermath of the defeat.",
      "Solskjaer would be sacked the day after the loss to Watford and he explained how he learned his fate.",
      "He added: \"I got a text message the next morning from Ed Woodward saying he needed to see me in his office at Carrington.",
      "\"That was pretty hard when you’ve been at the club for 18 years with all those good and bad times I’d had lots of backing and good times with Ed.",
      "\"He’d given me the chance and for that, I’ll always be grateful. I dropped my family at the airport before the text arrived. After the text, I told my wife that I might be back in Norway before her.",
      "\"It was an emotional day. Very emotional. I didn’t think it would be, but it was like leaving your family.",
      "\"I wanted to speak to all the players and say goodbye. I spoke to the coaches and the staff. Then I went back to an empty house.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "No great surprise to see Man United’s far-reaching and widespread search for a former Fergie player to be interim manager and take over from a former Fergie player as caretaker manager dominating proceedings today.",
      "Even less surprise to see an awful lot of nonsense about it, and even less surprise to still see a few bits of nonsense about other things as well.",
      "For all our p*ssing and moaning, let Mediawatch not deny its gratitude for this unexpected and delightfully rich seam of early January content.",
      "There are lots of words that used to serve a perfectly good and useful purpose. Words that had meanings that were understood and widely agreed upon. Now a great many of those words have had their specific meaning diluted and stretched and twisted beyond any lingering hints of usefulness, and that seems a shame.",
      "One such word is ‘cryptic’. We partly blame Karl Pilkington, but mainly blame – as Mediawatch generally does – the British tabloid media.",
      "Two entirely predictable and normal things happened during Oliver Glasner’s most recent press conference at Crystal Palace.",
      "First, journalists asked Glasner about him being linked with the Man United job. Absolutely fine, be weird if they didn’t.",
      "Second, Glasner batted those questions away. Absolutely fine, be weird if he didn’t.",
      "What he absolutely did not do, the Mirror, is offer ‘a cryptic response to Man Utd job links’.",
      "The intro is odd as well.",
      "Oliver Glasner claimed he is “not allowed to bet” when quizzed on the Manchester United vacancy as he smiled when questioned on the prospect of eventually landing the job.",
      "He didn’t ‘claim’ anything of the sort. Again, we’ve got a word in danger of losing all meaning. ‘Claim’ here is used to imply doubt where none exists. He simply stated that his contract doesn’t allow him to bet on football, something that is obviously and provably going to be true.",
      "Anyway. Those ‘cryptic’ responses in full.",
      "Glasner was asked how he feels to be favourite for the United job and said: “I am not allowed to bet. My contract has one paragraph that I am not allowed to bet. And I don’t look at it.”",
      "Pressed further on whether we should bet on him to eventually land in the Old Trafford dugout he smiled and added: “I also cannot give insider information. That would also be breaking my contract. I am Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask more questions about it.”",
      "There you have it. You can say those answers are ‘non-committal’ if you must. You can say he refused to rule anything out, you might even argue he was a touch spiky about it all. But there is nothing cryptic here. These are clear and straightforward answers of just about the only sort he could possibly provide.",
      "",
      "Meanwhile, The Sun’s live transfer blog promises a ‘HUGE Semenyo to Man City update’.",
      "Which is? Antoine Semenyo is probably going to join Man City quite soon.",
      "Thanks. For. That.",
      "",
      "With pretty much every other major news outlet – and the bookies – in unanimous agreement that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is in line for a return to Man United as interim manager until the end of the season, replacing caretaker manager Darren Fletcher, this headline from the Daily Express website stands out.",
      "Man Utd new manager agreement reached as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer snubbed",
      "Alas, issues of space must have left them with no choice but to omit the key words ‘by Daily Express journalists’ that really do belong somewhere in the above.",
      "Now we’re all familiar by now with this particular use of ‘agreement reached’ (see Mediawatches passim) whereby the agreement is in fact between a group of journalists – normally but not exclusively Reach journalists – rather than any club or clubs or persons actually relevant to the story.",
      "But this is a particularly good one because there isn’t even really a ‘Man Utd new manager agreement reached’ beyond it not being Solskjaer. Four journalists have contributed, each putting forward four different names for who it should actually be: Zinedine Zidane, Roberto De Zerbi, Oliver Glasner and Enzo Maresca.",
      "That’s the opposite of agreement reached, if anything. You can’t have an agreement on who a new manager should be by all agreeing on one person who it shouldn’t be, surely. That way madness lies. We can all agree the new Man United manager shouldn’t be Donald Trump, for instance, but that doesn’t really get us any closer to agreeing on who it should be.",
      "",
      "This is another one of those where Mediawatch wonders if we’re being a bit precious, but that to us really does still feel like something important worth fighting.",
      "In this case it’s the batty old notion that quotes in quote marks ought to accurately reflect the words contained in the quote they’re quoting.",
      "Here’s what the Mirror have come up with to leave us feeling a bit queasy:",
      "‘I was sacked by Man Utd like Ruben Amorim – I knew I was done midway through final game’",
      "Now the issue we have here is that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer – for it is he – never mentions Ruben Amorim at all.",
      "There were many lows. I’m one of them who looks back at the lows more than the highs.",
      "The end at Watford, well you can’t get lower than that. I more or less knew at half-time, so my team talk was about enjoying the last 45 minutes together and giving their all.",
      "Some of them had stopped running, caring. But then in the second half we played well.",
      "Donny [Van de Beek] came on and scored. We should have scored more. Then we got a sending off. 2-1 until the 94th minute. It sounds really bad that it was a 4-1 defeat. It was bad to lose against Watford but it wasn’t a 4-1 game.",
      "And there’s a very good reason why he never mentions Amorim at all. And that’s because these quotes have come from an interview Solskjaer gave to The National in February 2024.",
      "That is, several months before Ruben Amorim was appointed Man United manager, never mind sacked. If he had said what that headline says he did, there would be far graver concerns than the tish and fipsy of the undeniable travails of being Man United boss. The very fabric of space and time would be under threat.",
      "Now. Does it really matter? In this specific case, maybe not. It’s a low-level mischief, really, a way to give a topical hook to some harmless old quotes – albeit that unbeknownst to the journalist tasked with reheating that old interview an even better hook would arrive before the day was done.",
      "But it will never not make us uncomfortable. And the fact it’s all for something as small and twatty as this is worse, in a way, because it just seems even less worthwhile opening up the dangers that lurk in a world where we entirely give up the idea of having to accurately quote the actual words people actually said when they actually said them.",
      "",
      "Lovely little example here from the Mirror of two perennial Mediawatch favourites: journalists massively overestimating how important the rest of the world considers the minutiae of their job, and deeply misleading headlines.",
      "Man Utd given special exemption to Premier League rule after Darren Fletcher appointment",
      "They’ve let him do the pre-match press conference a bit later than usual. Yet here we are, with the world still turning.",
      "",
      "Look, it’s always headline news in the British tabloids when a middling Dutch club announce who will be their technical director next season. It’s definitely not only of interest to the Mirror because they can put this headline on it:",
      "Ex-Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag returns to former club four months after brutal sacking",
      "Let’s hear no more cheap, snarky suggestions otherwise. FC Twente, by the way, if you are remotely bothered.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after back-to-back draws against Leeds United and Fulham.",
      "West Ham have already sacked one manager this season and could be about to sack another; an old boy is favourite for the job.",
      "Chelsea have done a madness once again and we are here for it, while West Ham v Nottingham Forest was worst game ever.",
      "There’s endless talk of Man Utd DNA so the alternative is obvious: Stick them in a costume. Oliver Glasner is told to run away…",
      "The new Man Utd boss will have the “final decision” on Joshua Zirkzee’s future as Fabrizio Romano reveals Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the “leading candidate”.",

They might have lost, they should have won, but I think they drew.",
      "The post-match talking heads on Sky were of course ready with their knives out and a glint in their eye, relishing the opportunity to lay in to Arteta. No style, no system, no creativity, and he’s too much of an obnoxious personality. At this stage, Arteta was flailing about angrily on the touchline and discarding superstars like Aubameyang and Ozil. As expected, they didn’t hold back.",
      "Of all people, Jose Mourinho was the guest pundit and, (years later I am very much paraphrasing this), he said something along the lines of “if you can’t see that Arteta is implementing a distinct system and the players that he chooses to play are buying in to it then you are blind”. The other talking heads kinda shut up, smirked, and politely agreed to disagree.",
      "My point is, and I don’t pretend to have a footballing brain the size of Jose Mourinho, but that’s pretty much the feeling I had about Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. Amorim didn’t inherit Fergie’s 1999 treble winners, he inherited Ten Hag’s mediocre band of misfits. Not a terrible side, but poor enough to get the previous manager sacked. Watching them play, the results weren’t great, and crumbs they were frustrating to watch at times (oftentimes they were hilarious to watch), but the longer I watched I could see that he was making progress, the system was taking shape.",
      "Football is always Ideology vs Results, and results usually win in the end, but I think Amorim was hired on an ideology which everyone could see would take a few years to get in place.

He could have worked with what he had to give the team the best chance to win and get points, and slowly progressed to his way of play once all the tools were in place. This is not a charity.

That the performances were turning around was more because of the inordinate amount of money and sheer inevitability of talent that brings than anything else.",

Whatever the ‘haha, second place bottler’ banter merchants like to think, everyone who came across Arteta at every point before and after Arsenal hired him, from his coaching peers and players to the board rooms could see he had the qualities and personality to become an elite coach, he has changed and evolved into one over his tenure and Arsenal are immensely lucky to have him.",
      "But he was able to succeed where Emery didn’t (and I have a lot to say on this if F365 wants to give me a run at a fan article like that West Ham chap got) mostly because Arsenal got their house in order behind the scenes and it is fair to ask, if you don’t believe United have that, whether anyone can succeed.",

Reports suggest Wilcox and Ratcliffe had begun nudging Amorim on tactical details before the axe fell. Some see that as overreach. If you hire someone welded to a back three, why the surprise when he insists on playing that way?",
      "Initially, I had some sympathy for Amorim. But I think the story goes back to the hiring.",
      "After Ten Hag, the hierarchy clearly fell in love with Ruben Amorim. They liked his charisma, his record, his face, and believed he could be the poster boy for Manchester United for the next decade under INEOS. At the same time, Wilcox spoke about identifying a style of play that would run through the club. We know he favoured a 4-3-3, and it is hard to believe that did not imply a back four long term. United’s history of attacking wide players would hopefully have been part of that thinking as well. That clearly clashed with Amorim’s known devotion to a back three.",
      "My suspicion is that the job came with an understanding. Amorim could start with three at the back while he settled into the league, but over time the team would evolve into a back four. That is how United play, and he would be supported through poor results because this was meant to be a long-term project (something Ratcliffe would keep his word on, publicly backing him for three years in October). Amorim accepted, likely believing he could deal with the change later or even perhaps change their minds through results.",
      "After a year of consistently poor performances in the back three, Christmas was chosen as the point of evolution. AFCON and injuries gave the necessary caveats, meaning no face was lost on either side.",
      "The Bournemouth and Villa games showed improvement. Attacking patterns began to emerge quickly. Then United beat Newcastle and everybody was happy. The team was improving following a change from the coach, who had been supported well by the board. Big money deals to finally fix the midfield were mooted. Champions League was still in sight. You could see where it was meant to go.",
      "Then came Wolves.",
      "Against a historically poor side, Amorim either lost his nerve or pushed back against the hierarchy by reverting to the back three. It failed. United went in behind, he switched to a back four, the team improved immediately, and the game was there to be won. It was not. The damage was done.",
      "From there, reports of arguments and nudging from above made sense. If the agreement had always been to evolve over the Christmas period and Amorim had gone back on it while costing the team points, the hierarchy were entitled to challenge him.",
      "Leeds was the final straw. Persisting with the back three and publicly leaning into the manager versus head coach narrative felt like deliberate provocation.",
      "I think Amorim had been overwhelmed for some time. Fear and ego pushed him toward the system he trusted most. Changing formation while overseeing one of the worst United runs in modern history would have felt like admitting the hierarchy were right all along.",
      "It is easy to see both sides. A potentially generational young coach was hired with the understanding he would initially be supported before evolving the team toward a defined long-term identity. Amorim reneged on that agreement.",
      "And he was never the manager. He was the first Head Coach of Manchester United. Everyone knew that. Saying otherwise in public could easily have been seen as crossing a line. A profitable one for Amorim.",
      "I know it is fashionable to pile on Ratcliffe and Wilcox, but there is at least a chance they did most things right. They picked the right guy, backed him, and worked with him. But he managed to fuck it up.\nMatt",

Edwards pocketed the money, walked away and left millions of United supporters in deep trouble. He even has the brass neck to go back and watch games. There is no doubt that when those money grabbing carpetbaggers from America “STOLE” our club the rot well and truly set in.",
      "Then due to greed and incompetence the Glazers wasted all the money they pulled out of the club along with all the debt they placed upon it. So the club was put up for sale because the Glazers had become nervous of the future costs facing them. The stadium was falling down and they owed that much money they were never going to borrow the money for a new stadium.",

So what we have got is his third option, like most of the players he has bought, not top quality.",

      "Ruben Amorim has somehow managed to contrive a scenario where he leaves Manchester United with reputation intact despite quite possibly being their worst manager ever. It’s a neat trick for sure, almost as neat as his penchant for turning corners that never led anywhere other than another blind alley or cul-de-sac.",
      "But enough of Amorim. He, like so many other poor hapless souls, is now part of Manchester United’s past. Who is their future? Who is the next manager for the impossible job? The one who this time will definitely be the man to return them to the promised land and then not in fact do that?",

      "He somehow made Aston Villa the third best Premier League team of 2025 while battling PSR issues. He probably deserves another crack at a massive club, if he can be arsed with the pressure.",
      "We can see this one happening but is the timing right?",
      "",
      "According to reports in Spain: ‘At Manchester United, some directors believe that Xavi could be the ideal man to rebuild the team, especially since his style of play resembles what they have been looking for since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.’",
      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an ‘interesting’ club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",

      "Absolutely everything about Michael Carrick suggests he should be a very good football manager indeed. A thoughtful player – most notably of course for Man United themselves, which always helps – and now a thoughtful pundit. Unfortunately the bit in between where he was actually a football manager was less good.",
      "We remain powerfully unconvinced that impeccable Knows The Club credentials could override everything else. It would be a spectacular gamble. But we must also consider the possibility that United bring him in as a ship-steadying interim to get them through to the summer; if that happens and he takes charge of 10 games then he’ll be the ‘winner’ in the eyes of the bookies.",
      "",
      "The former Man United midfielder has been named interim boss and that’s always significant. One, because you can never entirely rule out the possibility of him going Full Solskjaer and getting the job on a full-time basis anyway, but as we noted when considering Michael Carrick’s appeal also because as far as the bookies are concerned if he takes charge of 10 games he’ll be settled as a winner regardless of whether he actually gets the full-time gig or not.",
      "Worth also remembering here, of course, that United have a lighter fixture load than normal with no Europe, so it will take longer than might usually be the case to rack up 10 games.",

In the specific case of this silly club, it helps that he plays the same system as Manchester United. Or maybe it doesn’t, who knows anymore? We think this might be his XI should he arrive in the summer…",

      "Well, it’s back to the drawing board for Manchester United after they finally cut ties with former *head coach* Ruben Amorim.",
      "It may have come at least a few months too late, but INEOS have finally made the right call to part company with Amorim, who admittedly forced their hand with a sack ultimatum relating to January signings.",
      "Amorim is the worst Man Utd boss post-Sir Alex Ferguson, but his demise follows a familiar trend set by previous managers, with mid-season exits leading club chiefs to the interim route before they make a permanent appointment in the summer.",
      "This time, however, Man Utd will be making not one, but two, interim appointments. Current boss Darren Fletcher is due to be replaced by a more suitable temporary, who could end up being fellow club legend and former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "We must respect INEOS for providing such entertainment by going for the most convoluted and thus funniest route with replacing Amorim, which would become even better if Solskjaer, once he’s back at the wheel, goes the whole hog with his full circle moment by maintaining his current 74% win rate as caretaker to leave Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co. with no choice but to make him United’s permanent boss once more.",
      "This would be the dream scenario for neutrals (and certain Man Utd legends stuck in the past), but INEOS will probably think better of keeping Solskjaer (or another interim) beyond this season.",
      "Instead, they are said to have already drawn up a list of permanent options, with their shortlist said to be led by Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, who is their ‘top candidate’.",
      "READ: ‘Ruben Interim’ sacked by Man Utd: The inside story of the inside stories, from Wilcox to ‘crazy’ Martinez",
      "Glasner is certainly deserving of a job of Man Utd’s stature following his stellar work at Crystal Palace, and the imminent expiry of his contract would make for a seamless appointment.",
      "The respected Austrian also happens to use the same formation adopted by Amorim and has found a way to make it work in the Premier League to a greater degree.",
      "So, assuming that Glasner is appointed in the summer and that he continues to use a 3-4-3 formation at Man Utd, what would be his starting XI next season?",
      "Well, starting with an easy one, summer signing Senne Lammens would *obviously* remain Man Utd’s No.1 because his fine start to the season has quashed any remaining hopes held by outcast Andre Onana of being handed a reprieve by a new manager.",
      "In front of him, Man Utd have a wider breadth of options at centre-back than in other positions, so it is certainly feasible that they also do not strengthen in this department in the summer.",
      "Therefore, the current cream of the crop would continue under Glaser; Leny Yoro as the right centre-back, Matthijs de Ligt in the middle and Lisandro Martinez on the left. This strong trio would also benefit from Glasner not following Amorim in needlessly tinkering with his back three…",
      "The situation is more complicated at wing-back, and it could see Man Utd pull off a double raid on Crystal Palace to sign £26m-rated Daniel Munoz, thus handing the 29-year-old his “dream” transfer.",
      "Munoz’s immense form at Palace over the past 18 months, as one of the standout natural wing-backs in the Premier League and Europe, indicates he’s capable of making the step up. He would also be an affordable fix for Man Utd as a no-brainer signing.",
      "On the other flank, it would make sense for Glasner to stand by Patrick Dorgu, who was signed as a long-term project and solution to Amorim’s wing-back headache on the left.",
      "Dorgu has not been without his issues at Man Utd, and he is still raw, but he has been one of their better performers in recent weeks, albeit in a different role, and could easily end up realising his potential working under a world-class head coach.",
      "Onto central midfield, and a key reason why Amorim’s 3-4-3 system failed at Man Utd was that he never had the right blend in the middle of the pitch, though this area is set for a revamp in the coming months.",
      "As good as he has been for Man Utd, Fernandes has been somewhat hamstrung in the deeper role alongside Casemiro; he should be sacrificed one year later than ideal as a Saudi Pro League transfer would fund the club’s summer transfer business, while the veteran Brazilian is primed for a bit-part role if he accepts a contract extension on reduced terms.",
      "In their place should and potentially will be Kobbie Mainoo and £100m signing Carlos Baleba.",
      "Mainoo is rightly already being touted as the big winner of Amorim’s demise, and he will be relishing the prospect of an overdue fresh start, while all reports indicate that Baleba remains the most likely candidate to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement in the No.6 role.",
      "Then, like with Lammens, the starters in the No.10 positions are easy to select, with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha making these spots their own since arriving in the summer.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have been head and shoulders above the rest of Man Utd’s attackers this term and are natural fits for the No.10 role in Amorim and Glasner’s system, and they would no doubt blend nicely with Marcus Rashford if/when he returns.",
      "With Amorim being a principle reason why Rashford is not currently playing for Man Utd, it’s hardly surprising that reports of a summer return to Old Trafford for United’s academy product are already circulating.",
      "Rashford’s form for Aston Villa, Barcelona and England has made Amorim look rather foolish, but given the Spanish club’s renowned financial troubles, Amorim-less Man Utd are perhaps the forward’s most likely destination next season.",
      "And he can return to Man Utd stronger for his experiences elsewhere and probably start ahead of struggling striker Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Amorim was finally shown the door after 63 largely forgettable games in charge at Old Trafford, with the beneficiaries and casualties of his demise fairly easy to delineate.",
      "",
      "When Amorim referred to Mainoo as “the future of Manchester United” in December, he added that the England international simply “needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days”.",
      "Mainoo, at a crucial period in his development, had already sat tightly enough for an opportunity which was not forthcoming. Not 18 months have passed since he started a European Championship final, which itself came a few weeks after his match-winning turn in the FA Cup final. Yet only against Grimsby has the 20-year-old been entrusted with longer than 45 minutes in any game this season.",
      "Through such curious treatment Mainoo has kept his counsel – and for one regrettable exception ensured his entourage did the same – with a clean slate post-Amorim surely his reward.",
      "No-one stands to benefit more from the departure of Amorim than the gifted academy graduate whose overdue invite back in from the bitter cold can help address glaring problems in that Manchester United midfield.",
      "It is thought that he could ‘benefit most’ from the interim appointment of Darren Fletcher in what will presumably be a short-term arrangement, with “the future of Manchester United” finally allowed to play a part in the present again.",
      "",
      "It is exceptional work that of the ‘hell of a brains trust’ held responsible for appointing Amorim at Manchester United, the only dissenting voice was dispensed with over a year before his concerns over the suitability of the Portuguese were fully realised.",
      "A penny for Ashworth’s thoughts would be a drop in the ocean considering the £4.1m pay-off he landed after serving a longer period of gardening leave at Newcastle than he did actually working in the fabled Old Trafford power structure.",
      "That difference of opinion over whether Amorim was the best possible fit was ultimately his undoing. Ashworth suggested there might be better appointments out there than a tactically obstinate coach whose ideals clashed with the composition of a squad which could hardly afford to have more money spent on it, especially in the middle of a season.",
      "INEOS disagreed, ousted their sporting director, spent around £250m on signings for Amorim and then sacked him while Ashworth was settling into his new role in charge of ‘strategic oversight’ and ‘building long-term systems’ at the FA, where he established his reputation for precisely the sort of structure-led executive vision Manchester United need – the kind they had and ignored.",
      "",
      "“The Club” might never have been as thoroughly, fundamentally “known” as by the former player, ambassador, reserve team and first-team striker coach, caretaker and full-time manager who has represented them on the pitch or in the dugout 534 times.",
      "It should be with an acceptance that Rio Ferdinand cannot propose, regardless of results or performances, that Solskjaer is offered a blank contract to fill and sign. And that Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are legally prevented from referring to the Norwegian only by his first name.",
      "But Manchester United absolutely have to put Ole at the wheel again. If for no other reason than the fact Darren Fletcher is taking his turn, Ruud van Nistelrooy had one last season and Ryan Giggs has to be skipped over, even if doing so is as hard as a totem pole.",
      "It is already shameful that Manchester United are back in the same sort of position Solskjaer inherited seven years ago, so they really might as well make the best of it.",
      "And after 14 months of sacrificing their modesty, pride and dignity at the altar of a stubborn philosophical and tactical egotist, Manchester United probably do need a supporter to stroke their hair, tell them they’re beautiful, wait on them hand and foot and regale them with stories about “Sir Alex” for half a season.",
      "It is objectively hilarious that Solskjaer finds himself as the saviour rushing to help someone he actively knows doesn’t see him in the same way, but also completely fair play because it guarantees someone who has previously only ever managed Molde, Cardiff and Besiktas semi-regular work at Manchester United.",
      "",
      "It is almost two years since they sold a 27.7 per cent stake, and with it control over football operations at Manchester United, and it genuinely feels like the Glazers would not have made half as many atrocious decisions.",
      "",
      "He got to do the ‘three trophies’ thing again! Genuinely chuffed for him. But slightly worried he didn’t refer to his greatest career achievement of finishing second.",
      "",
      "There is an argument to suggest Amorim is better off now than at any previous point over the past year or so.",
      "He has certainly somehow engineered a situation whereby taking Manchester United to 15th, bottling a major final against Spurs and spending hundreds of millions to continue overseeing really quite turgid football has nevertheless not damaged his reputation nearly as much as it should, and that he has been as much a victim of the club’s mess than a culprit.",
      "But this can only have been a chastening experience for a man who was among the world’s most promising, exciting, charismatic and captivating young coaches upon his appointment at 39. When Amorim turns 41 at the end of January it will have been a hell of a paper round.",
      "And consider this list of the roles the permanent post-Ferguson managers sacked by Manchester United took up next:",

      "Back then he said “football is not overnight” and that “we have to be patient, we have a long-term plan, it isn’t a light switch and you can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions”.",
      "Manchester United are fifth in a form table since those comments, which were made when they were 10th.",
      "Others might prefer Ratcliffe’s “best in class, 10 out of 10s” description of those he wanted to put in key executive roles at Old Trafford, which currently include a director of football whose only previous experience in such a job came in a single season in the Championship with Southampton.",
      "In that same interview Ratcliffe did also say that INEOS had “made mistakes in football so I’m really pleased that we made them before we arrived in Manchester United” so it really might be that one.",
      "But there is also an argument for when Ratcliffe said the Manchester United shot-callers would decide “what the style of football is and that will be the Manchester United style of football. And the coach will have to play that style,” before specifically appointing a coach who did not play that style.",
      "Ratcliffe has made an absurd number of gloriously bad calls while sat in the big chair; that he has done so while furiously messaging Wilcox about changing formation and playing Bryan Mbeumo at wing-back makes it no less hilarious.",
      "",
      "And to the man himself, who wields an inexplicable degree of power at one of the biggest clubs in world football because billionaire owners see ‘Manchester City’ on someone’s LinkedIn and automatically believe they have found a cheat code everyone else has overlooked.",
      "Wilcox was academy director at the Etihad for six years and director of football for Southampton in the Championship for one, before he was given the keys to the Manchester United clown car and some scribbled directions which read ‘Step 1, spend millions. Step 5, knock everyone off perch’, with the middle pages torn out and eaten by David Gill.",
      "Of course, Wilcox was a player and coach before that. In fact, he referred to himself as “a coach at heart” during a Q&A in September, adding: “That’s a strength in my role now but also causes me a bit of a problem because I always want to interfere in what the managers are doing.”",
      "The explosive meeting which effectively sealed Amorim’s fate can only really be viewed through that prism.",
      "And while those inside stories on the Portuguese’s demise underline how Wilcox has inherited Ed Woodward’s contacts book and innate control over the narrative – the importance of which should not be overlooked – they also emphasise how inextricably tied he is to Amorim’s appointment, failure and sacking, and how Manchester United picked a 3-4-3 fundamentalist before turning against him for playing too much 3-4-3.",
      "It is one thing backing Russell Martin for a second-tier promotion push and adorning him with a few Premier League loanees and Manchester City academy alumni, and entirely another making decisions designed to help actual Manchester United navigate their way through a crippling decade-long identity crisis to become legitimate elite trophy contenders again.",
      "Wilcox must have discovered that post-haste, not that he will say so publicly. Not that he will say much at all publicly, unless Manchester United are doing vaguely okay.",
      "That was the case around the time of Amorim’s one-year anniversary in charge when, in the midst of a genuinely unprecedented run of three Premier League wins and a draw, Wilcox implored the club to “continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben’s idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea. It’s a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for.”",
      "Two months later, Wilcox was one of those who made the decision to sack Amorim in large part because of an inflexibility over his ideas. He will not be able to avoid the axe covered in his own fingerprints forever if the next appointment isn’t a success.",
      "",
      "The streak goes on. De Ligt will still never have started consecutive professional club seasons under the same head coach until 2027/28 at the earliest.",
      "To have had 18 different managers at the age of 26, and to have made more than 42 appearances under only one by virtue of having worked with them at two clubs, is remarkable. At this point it’s De Ligt’s responsibility to maintain that until he retires.",
      "",
      "Fewer spaces, innit? Although they won’t be habitually subbed off on the hour of every game so that’s something.",
      "The past is Man Utd’s biggest problem with ex-players and ex-managers dominating the narrative. They should all be blocked.",
      "No great surprise to see Man United’s far-reaching and widespread search for a former Fergie player to be interim manager dominate today’s proceedings.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after back-to-back draws against Leeds United and Fulham.",
      "West Ham have already sacked one manager this season and could be about to sack another; an old boy is favourite for the job.",
      "Chelsea have done a madness once again and we are here for it, while West Ham v Nottingham Forest was worst game ever.",
      "There’s endless talk of Man Utd DNA so the alternative is obvious: Stick them in a costume. Oliver Glasner is told to run away…"

      "Liam Rosenior has been given a laughable six-and-a-half-year deal at Chelsea having swapped desks in the BlueCo organisation while Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins at Manchester United, albeit it on a temporary basis.",
      "Keeping the seat warm for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is some mission.",
      "Those two jobs are some of the most coveted in England and the world, but which is more appealing? Here’s a look at what Rosenior and the new United boss faces.",
      "",
      "Let’s start with Chelsea.",
      "The Stamford Bridge club are owned by BlueCo, a primarily US-based consortium that was founded in 2022 to purchase Chelsea after Roman Abramovich was forced to sell. They are a multi-club group ownership having also purchased Strasbourg in 2023.",
      "The chairman, and most public figure, is Todd Boehly while Behdad Eghbali is among the directors. While Boehly is often the man blamed for Chelsea’s latest mess, Eghbali is the one calling the shots and reportedly the man who was in constant disagreement with Enzo Maresca.",
      "The MO of BlueCo has always been to buy some of the best young players in the world and then give them long contracts to amortise the costs and comply with PSR. Since BlueCo took over in 2022, no Premier League club has spent more money with around £1.49bn spent.",
      "Given BlueCo only took over in 2022, the ultimate end goal of that project has yet to become clear. Are they looking to sell these players on for profit? Or do they believe they can win Premier League titles in three or four years’ time?",
      "At Manchester United, things are not too dissimilar. In February 2024, Jim Ratcliffe’s INEOS spent £1.3bn to take 29% of the club away from the Glazer family. While the Glazers continue to sit back and watch the dollars flow into their bank account, Ratcliffe has taken over football operations.",
      "He appointed Omar Berrada as CEO, who previously worked for Manchester City owners the City Football Group while Jason Wilcox is director of football.",
      "It is with Wilcox that Ruben Amorim reportedly had mounting disagreements, particularly when it came to transfers and the team’s tactical set-up.",
      "While United’s hierarchy is perhaps not as dictatorial as Chelsea’s, it is expected that any new manager will have to appease Wilcox and Berrada if they are to stay in the job. United’s board also appear to cut their manager a bit more slack. Maresca left after saying he endured the worst ‘48 hours’ of his Chelsea career while Amorim was allowed a 15th-place finish, embarrassing cup exit to Grimsby and describing the team as the worst in the club’s history.",
      "",
      "Squad-wise, Chelsea are marginally better – look at the league table – but there are problems to be fixed for both sides.",
      "United’s is currently a mix of good but ageing players and young talents still lacking experience. Senne Lammens has shored up the long-troubled area of goalkeeper but the use of Ayden Heaven in recent weeks has highlighted how injury-prone United’s main central defenders can be.",
      "In midfield, both Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are not getting any younger and Amorim’s insistence on strengthening this area is what reportedly cost him his job. A new manager may have a higher opinion of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Up front, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have brought much-needed freshness but Joshua Zirkzee and Benjamin Sesko remain unconvincing.",
      "For Chelsea, they play exactly like what they are – a young squad full of potential but lacking the experience to be consistent.",
      "Moises Caicedo is one of the best midfielders in the league along with Enzo Fernandez, while Estevao looks like a star in the making. Cole Palmer is a former Player of the Year but struggled in 2025 and they have a lot of good if not great options up front in Pedro Neto, Jamie Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "At the back, it is very youth-focused with Tosin Adarabioyo being the oldest member at 28.",
      "All of that is to say that Chelsea’s squad have a lot of potential; it is just about how a new manager can get the best out of that and whether a more seasoned veteran is needed for others to flourish.",

      "",
      "When it comes to history, there is no debate. Manchester United are one of the most successful teams in the history of football with the trophy room to show for it.",
      "Chelsea did win trophies before Abramovich’s takeover but they had only been league champions once before the Russian came in. The vast majority of their trophies, especially the more prestigious ones, have come this century.",
      "In more recent years, Chelsea have become the more successful club with two Champions League wins since United last won the trophy and the same number of league titles. A Club World Cup and Conference League trophy completed the set for the London side and there is a reasonable debate to be had that Chelsea have been the most consistently successful English club of the 21st century.",
      "But the lure of United, along with its millions of fans, is the possibility of being the first league-winning manager since Ferguson.",
      "Football managers have often got themselves into this position by having an unshakeable self-belief and so, even if there is plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise, they will believe they can be the one that ‘fixes’ United.",
      "Chelsea may be stronger on paper both in terms of squad and recent success, but it is that aspect that may sway a potential manager over to United.",
      "",
      "If you ask either club what their expectations are, the stock answer is ‘win the league’ because neither can be seen to be aiming for anything less. But in reality, a few spots below the top place would enable a manager to stay in post.",
      "Of the two, the bar would appear to be higher at Chelsea. They have qualified for the Champions League in five of the last seven seasons and so simply finishing top four is perhaps not good enough. For Liam Rosenior arriving in mid-season, ensuring that is a must for this campaign but that expectation will be raised next year.",
      "For a United manager, Champions League qualification, and the money that comes with it, would be a seen as success having done so just once in the past four years. Fletcher or Solskjaer stand a good chance of doing that with the club three points off Liverpool.",
      "How they go about that also comes with expectations. Chelsea have a mode of business that relies on a manager getting the best out of young players and so Rosenior will have to accept that. The good news is that they are willing to get their chequebook out, albeit not for established world stars.",
      "For United, it remains to be seen how much influence Wilcox and Berrada will seek to have post-Amorim with the Portuguese mostly given carte blanche. Until he didn’t. Transfer-wise, it seems to be a case of you will get what you’re given for both clubs.",

      "Roberto De Zerbi is very interested in becoming the next permanent manager of Manchester United, with sources indicating the Marseille boss sees the Old Trafford role as an ideal next step in his career – and we can reveal the Italian is ready to leave France at the end of the season if offered the job.",
      "The 46-year-old, who previously impressed in the Premier League with Brighton & Hove Albion, is said to be enthusiastic about a potential move. Insiders claim De Zerbi feels ready for a major challenge and is particularly drawn to the prospect of another stint in English football, where his attacking philosophy earned widespread acclaim.",
      "Manchester United‘s current approach plays perfectly into this scenario. Following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim after just 14 months in charge, the club has opted for an interim solution for the remainder of the season, delaying a permanent appointment until the summer. This timeline suits De Zerbi’s situation at Marseille, where he remains under contract until 2027, but would be open to discussions if a prestigious opportunity arises.",
      "However, they do face some competition as sources have stated that Tottenham have De Zerbi down as a candidate to replace Thomas Frank. The Danish manager will be assessed at the end of the season, and if they do not feel enough progress is made, Spurs could also be in the market for a new manager. The Italian is amongst the thoughts of those at the club.",
      "De Zerbi’s name, though, also carries significant weight within United’s decision-making structure under INEOS.",
      "He was interviewed by Manchester United representatives in 2024 as they considered alternatives to Erik ten Hag, highlighting long-standing admiration for his methods. That internal support persists, with sources suggesting key figures at Old Trafford continue to view him as a strong candidate capable of implementing an exciting, progressive style of play.",

      "During his time at Brighton, De Zerbi guided the Seagulls to their highest-ever Premier League finish and European qualification, showcasing his ability to maximise resources and develop players.",
      "Pundits have echoed this praise, while my sources now state he is seen as a top choice to succeed Amorim at Old Trafford alongside Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner.",
      "I reported on Monday how the Austrian was seen by INEOS as the outstanding choice to succeed the Portuguese. And while he too favours a three-man defensive line, he has shown more tactical flexibility and is not adverse to reverting to a 4-3-3 system, which many feels suits the players within the Old Trafford squad.",
      "While other names have emerged as contenders, De Zerbi’s prior Premier League success and existing backing inside the club position him prominently on the shortlist.",
      "For United fans frustrated by recent turbulence, the idea of De Zerbi’s bold, possession-dominant approach could signal a fresh era.",
      "As the club stabilises under interim management, all eyes will be on the summer when the pursuit of their next leader intensifies. Strong sources state that the feeling appears mutual – De Zerbi is ready and willing to answer the call.",

      "However, the 40-year-old’s dismissal has seen him offered a bucket-load of sympathy in the Portuguese media, with several publications directing their anger at both the players and those behind the scenes – and in particular Wilcox.",
      "Despite that, the removal of Amorim as manager appears to have come too late to prevent Joshua Zirkzee from pushing through his wish to leave Old Trafford.",

Instead it’s always culture, identity, heritage. Anything except the people who are actually running the club.",

There’s no way he could go straight from the Manchester United Clown Festival to working for a serious organisation like Morrisons. The senior management talent gap between Man U and Morrisons would be too big for him to negotiate at this stage in his career.\nBen Teacher",
      "",
      "It seems to me that there are two very clear truths in this latest chapter of the United show.",
      "Firstly, that the in-job performance of Ruben Amorim – over the entirety of his red devil reign – is irredeemably and unforgivably abysmal, and he should have been sacked because of that. In almost fifty league matches, he only won three times by more than one goal. He leaves with a negative six goal difference. That is hilariously bad, and should have seen any manager in world football – much less one at a ‘big club’ – looking for new work.",
      "Secondly, he’s clearly been fired not because of the above, but because he offended one or more snowflakes in the United hierarchy. And that’s the worst bit for me. We were told, after being at the whim of the Glazers’ utter disregard for football for a decade, that INEOS were serious people, who’d bring in best-in-class professionals. But the way this has transpired screams to me of insecure men who’ve been promoted above their ability and can’t take the finger being pointed back at them.",
      "Very few managers last even as long as he did. United as a club desperately need to get away from the ‘saviour-manager’ and just get a good coach in, who can make the most of what is available. There is not another Fergie out there. But that doesn’t mean that this team, and this squad, shouldn’t be playing much better and delivering much better results than it is.",

      "Man U are at least 2 managers away from anything close to their former glories, and have been since Ferguson left. It won’t happen for many obvious reasons, but they need 3+ seasons of something more like a Brentford/Brighton/Bournemouth style model to lay some stability and foundations for a proper rebuild before they start chasing elite managers/players. Had Amorim been a bit less wedded to his system, he might well have fit the bill here. They need to do it soon too, before they are forced to by those noodle and tractor partners finally removing their sponsorship deals.",
      "Ian H makes a good point regarding bulletproof and overly controlling hierarchies too, which brings me to my last point – I’ve heard Unai Emery’s name touted a lot today. Why would he leave a club that he has purring largely because he has Fergie-like levels of control, for 2026 Man U where he will have very little and an inferior squad?",
      "Sporting directors are a great idea in theory, but there’s a finite supply of managers period, let alone enough who are willing to cede that much control, fit whatever the chosen playing style is, AND bring success. Emery is living proof that something closer to the old ways can still work.\nRHT/TS x",

      "With the sacking of Amorim all attention is now focused on who is likely to be the next Man United manager. Several names have emerged including Xabi, De Zerbi and Glasner.",
      "I urge United to give due consideration to appointing Gareth Southgate. At this stage of the game, I can say with maximum confidence that nobody knows English football better than the man himself, that’s Southgate. He has acquired and exhibited thorough knowledge and understanding of the EPL, clearly manifest in his roles as player, club Manager and National team Manager.",
      "The point must further be made that Southgate has demonstrated flexibility, willingness and ability to make changes and deliver effective tactics, evident in taking England to the finals of the Euro competition. A sine qua non for achieving success in football is the relationship between the Manager and the players. The Manager and players interrelationships, by and large, impact the performance of the team.",
      "Needless to say that Southgate continuously and unabatedly established good rapport with the players he managed.

He is the right man for the job.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",

      "If some papers had Chelsea moving for Eddie Howe at the weekend, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more noise about Utd moving for him as that makes more sense and would potentially be a decent fit.",
      "The time could be right in the summer for all parties to move on – Newcastle would like a manager to help them take the next step to the truly elite level, a lot of the squad are ageing and running down contracts so a rebuild is coming – after last summer I’d prefer if it wasn’t Howe calling the shots on transfers and we’re yet to see what the relationship with the new DoF will be.",
      "I’d rather Howe left on his terms than be sacked given what he’s done for the club – he’ll always be a legend. I’d love to see him develop and change at Newcastle and prove the doubters (including me) wrong but football rarely rewards romanticism.",
      "As a Newcastle fan I think we are at a tipping point where Howe will have lived long enough to become the villain. The majority of fans are onside but there is a growing minority who are now sensing that tactically he’s peaked and he cannot escape the blame for such a lot of money (£100m+) spent on dross like Ramsey and Elanga. His focus on building an entire team of athletes/runners with no guile or flair becomes more obvious with time, but he could achieve a real bounce at Utd and get them back up the table.",
      "Howe’s approach would suit Utd’s fans and to a large degree could work with the players they have. Cunha, Mbuemo and Sesko were all wanted by Howe in the summer so he has already done his homework and won’t need a massive squad overhaul.",
      "Howe’s man-management style could work at United who I don’t think have had since Ole a manager who was really in tune with the players. If Bruno F is onside he’s an excellent player and Utd have the kind of sh*thouses Howe likes to have.",
      "Where it gets murkier is whether the Utd players are prepared to work as hard as Howe demands, and whether they have the legs/athleticism to play this ‘Intensity is our Identity’ way. Howe will also want the kind of control he’s gained at Newcastle on transfers, which seems to be where Amorim eventually crossed the line to be sacked, but he wouldn’t need the root and branch change Amorim wanted.",
      "I don’t think Howe will move mid-season. Despite a lot of quite poor performances Newcastle are well placed in all four competitions – can progress in the CL to the play-offs, home draw in the FA Cup, tough two legged tie with City in the Carabao but they are not invincible, and a few decent results will see them climb the table quickly.",

      "",
      "With so many teams struggling to string together a run of performances (like Villa’s recent surge shows), it’s clear that even 6th place, only 4 points above 15th, is pretty underwhelming, given the summer investment and all that extra time to train and prepare while not playing in Europe. It’s hard to empathize with Amorim, who said earlier this season that he was the coach. He also said not even the Pope could change his mind.",
      "But you do have to wonder how much ‘meddling’ into team selection and tactics was coming from the shadows of the ‘back room’ staff. Especially those that never have to front up to the cameras. Apparently, it’s pretty common for Directors of Football to speak publicly in many other major leagues.",
      "Regardless, it’s such a poor look on the sports guru that is Sir Jim. All his marginal gains, by cutting staff, staff lunches, etc., while squandering millions on managers and sporting directors. Results looking pretty bleak for a ‘Top 6’ club. Nothing marginal there.",
      "When checking whether the ’new manager bounce’ is a thing, one report indicated it works in about 75% of cases, with teams averaging 1.4 to 1.8 points more over the next 5 or 6 games. If true, perhaps teams should change managers every 6 games.",
      "But for firing Amorim in essentially the same week as Chelsea canning Maresca will create such a wonderful litmus test of how these two basket-case clubs fare over the rest of the season. Chelsea has form (under the old regime) for replacing managers and continuing to excel. Utd, not so much – possibly a proper new manager slump. Interesting days ahead.\nPaul McDevitt",
      "",
      "I was disappointed to see a major absence in the winners and losers column this week: Mainoo.",
      "Surely, if anyone is a winner from Amorim’s delightfully acrimonious departure it’s him (and maybe Amad if he can be released back to an attacking role again). You’d have to expect that it means he can finally get games without having to go to Italy or Turkey where everything will come with an asterisk.",
      "Second – and while I say this with a wink, you know I want it too – Rashford. We know Barca will not be able to find the money for him, in spite of him being loved by Flick and doing good work. So when he comes back, maybe it’s to a manager that actually knows how to use him. Would boil so much piss of course, which is a bonus.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "While I’m all for your clickbaity lists, ranking Erik Ten Hag fourth behind Solskjaer is interesting. I mean, everyone is entitled to their opinion and no one is denying that Ten Hag’s second season was awful and even the FA Cup fig leaf did not preserve any modesty, but factually – looking at win percentage – at 51.8% Ten Hag is only second to Mourinho and this includes results from his second season.",
      "A second season where due to injuries we started with 29 different back fours in 38 games in front of a new, error-prone goalkeeper. One might plausibly say that such intense disruption in defense in front of a goalkeeper who is new to the country, league and club prevented the goalkeeper from settling in and added to the nerves and confusion in an ever changing defence and the real question is with such chaos and negativity, how did he still manage to finish in the top half with 60 points (which incidentally is better than Amorim was on course to get with 31 points from 20 games)?",
      "Don’t get me wrong, Ten Hag wasn’t the perfect manager. I didn’t like his public criticism of Sancho, even if it was possibly merited. His reliance on certain players who weren’t performing was an issue and his scouting was mediocre.",
      "This said, during his second season the problems were massively overblown considering the injury crisis we faced and, where at other clubs leeway seems to be given for injuries, the circus surrounding Man Utd, the negativity, the constant will he/won’t he be sacked all took on a life of its own really and sucked the confidence out of the players.",
      "Ultimately, something needed to change and that change was the manager, but the idea that Solskjaer was a better manager than Ten Hag is absurd, especially when Ten Hag won two trophies compared to Solskjaer’s zero – the FA Cup Final being particularly impressive against league winners Man City.\nDaniel, Cambridge"

      "Man Utd have made their opening offer to sign RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on new signings in the summer transfer window as INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe looked to back Ruben Amorim, before sacking him on Monday.",
      "Since then, Man Utd have shown similar inconsistency in results with just eight wins from 20 Premier League matches this season.",
      "Thanks to four points separating sixth and 14th position in the league, Man Utd are somehow sixth and just three points off fourth-placed Liverpool after the Red Devils’ draw against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "However, the Red Devils could do with improvements in a number of positions over the January transfer window with Romano insisting last week that RB Leipzig’s Diomande is on their list of targets.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Leipzig don’t want to sell the player in January. Leipzig will do their best to keep the player in January. So eventually it could be a move for the summer, or in order to make it happen in January, they need to convince Leipzig. And it’s never easy with Red Bull Group.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Ruben Amorim ‘quirk’ revealed as he refused BBC entry to training!",
      "“Many clubs are following him. Man Utd are following Diomande, are really interested in Diomande for the future. Tottenham are doing the same. PSG are also following Diomande. And I’m told that more Premier League clubs are also tracking the situation.",
      "“Similar to Smit, it’s going to take a big amount of money. I don’t think €60m or €70m is going to be enough to convince Leipzig. The pricing is going to be higher. But for sure, Diomande and Smit, two names that are already now driving clubs crazy for the summer transfer window.”",
      "And now Africa Foot has claimed that Man Utd have ‘made an offer’ of €90m for Leipzig’s Diomande after Man City beat them to Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo.",

      "The Red Devils ‘are well on their way to finalising the deal’ as the report adds: ‘According to sources close to the Ivory Coast international (7 caps, 2 goals), Manchester United’s board has offered RB Leipzig €90 million to sign the young Elephant. A meeting took place this week between the clubs’ directors to discuss the matter. RB Leipzig has also given Manchester United permission to discuss contract details with the player’s representatives.",
      "‘According to the latest information from Yan Diomande’s entourage, Manchester United are offering the 20-year-old striker a five-year contract, with an option for a fourth year. The Red Devils’ proposed salary is reportedly €3.5 million per year.

      "Amorim came out after the match with a rant directed towards the board and his doubters before being sacked less than 24 hours later.",
      "Reports have claimed that Man Utd made the decision to sack Amorim before the Leeds fixture after he fell out with director of football Jason Wilcox over formations and recruitment.",
      "Man Utd are now likely to appoint an interim manager to follow Fletcher until the end of the season with the decision on a permanent successor to be taken in the summer.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano told his YouTube channel: “Man Utd have taken the decision to dismiss Ruben Amorim with immediate effect and the club are now assessing their next steps, with a strong possibility of appointing a caretaker manager until the end of the season before moving for a permanent solution in the summer.",

      "“That said, Man Utd may still explore opportunities in the market and could decide to appoint a permanent manager immediately, depending on the options available. The club will take time to evaluate the situation before making a final call.”",
      "Romano also clarified Amorim’s contract situation and rumours that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be his temporary replacement at Man Utd.",
      "He added: “It is important to clarify the situation regarding Ruben Amorim. This was a club decision, not a resignation. Amorim remains under contract with Man Utd until 2027, meaning the club will continue to pay his salary unless another club negotiates an exit in the coming months.",
      "“Amorim had publicly stated that he would not resign, and less than 24 hours later the club chose to end his tenure.",
      "“In the short term, Darren Fletcher is expected to be on the touchline for the upcoming midweek fixtures. Regarding rumours from England, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be open to returning as caretaker manager and would be willing to help the club if asked. However, there is no decision yet, either on a caretaker or on the permanent managerial appointment, which remains the most crucial choice.",
      "“Internal discussions are ongoing as Man Utd decide their next step following Amorim’s dismissal.”",
      "Plenty of names have been bandied about over the last 24 hours with both Crystal Palace’s Glasner and Newcastle’s Howe among the names mentioned.",
      "When asked about being favourite to take over at Old Trafford, Glasner said on Tuesday: “I’m not allowed to bet. I don’t look at it. I’m Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask me any more questions about it.”",
      "Newcastle head coach Howe was asked if anything could tempt him away from St James’ Park amid Amorim’s sacking at Man Utd, to which he replied: “No. Not at this current time.",
      "“The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships that I have with the people around me.",
      "“That has not always been consistently good. Things can change at any football club, but I’m very happy at the moment.”",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola hailed Amorim as a “top manager” after hearing the news of his sacking at Man Utd and wished him “all the best in the future”.",
      "Guardiola said in his Friday press conference: “It’s a fact [that managers now get] less time, I know. Like what happened with Enzo.",
      "“I cannot say anything for respect for the players and for the institution, Chelsea, United. Only I can say the same. Rúben is a top manager, so decisions have been made for our neighbours, so I wish him, Rúben, all the best in the future.”",

      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox had informal conversations with Ole Solskjaer and Michael Carrick on Tuesday and both are keen on being involved with the first team again; the club look set to confirm a short-term appointment until the end of the season",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 10:30, UK",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox had initial, informal conversations with the former players on Tuesday - both of whom, it's thought, are keen on being involved again with the first team.",
      "United do have other candidates they are considering for the role until the end of the season, including Ruud Van Nistelrooy who bridged the gap when Erik Ten Haag was sacked in October 2024 before Ruben Amorim took charge the following month.",
      "United look set to confirm a short-term appointment until the end of the season, to give them the breathing space to focus on a substantive appointment in the summer when more elite coaches are likely to be more readily available.",
      "Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva and Andoni Iraola all see their current contracts expire at the end of the season, and Thomas Tuchel, Julian Nagelsmann and Mauricio Pochettino could be available once their international commitments are complete at the World Cup.",
      "No meetings have been planned with Carrick and Solskjaer for Wednesday, with all the focus on Darren Fletcher's first game in charge of the team at Burnley. But it's expected those discussions will accelerate later in the week.",
      "\"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be a huge story if he came back. He was sacked by Manchester United in November 2021. He's incredibly popular with the Manchester United faithful.",
      "\"He loved it and he gave a very emotional farewell when he left. There were no bridges burnt. The impression I'm getting is that Solskjaer is the favourite.",
      "\"Jason Wilcox, who is leading this search, has spoken to him. Solskjaer has made it clear he would like to return to Old Trafford.\"",
      "As talks continue for an interim boss, among those linked with the permanent role are Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner and Newcastle's Eddie Howe.",
      "\"I am Crystal Palace manager. It's wasted time for you to ask any more questions. I don't talk about any other club other than Crystal Palace,\" he said.",
      "Howe, meanwhile, also reiterated his commitment to Newcastle.",
      "\"I'm 100 per cent here, working as hard as I can, head down, ignoring all the stuff that you guys write, good or bad, because it's irrelevant,\" he said.",
      "\"It's about today's work and trying to prepare the team as well as we can for Leeds [on Wednesday], so that will never change from my perspective, my commitment to my work and my job.",
      "\"As long as I'm happy and able to express myself in the best way that I can to help the team, nothing will change.\"",
      "Asked if there was anything which could tempt him away from St James' Park, Howe replied: \"No, not at this current time.",
      "\"The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships I have with the people around me. Now that's not always been consistently good and things can change at any football club.",
      "\"But, at the moment, I am very happy.\"",
      "Current interim boss Fletcher gave his first news conference on Tuesday ahead of the midweek trip to Burnley.",
      "After a busy 24 hours, the Manchester United U18s coach said: \"It's been surreal. It's an amazing honour to lead a Manchester United team. It wasn't in my wildest dreams that it was something that could potentially happen.",
      "\"To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I'm proud to do. It's not in the circumstances I expected it to happen so that doesn't sit easy with me.",
      "\"I've got a job to do which is to lead the team tomorrow. I have great honour and pride in doing that.\"",
      "Asked whether he had any conversations with Wilcox and Omar Berrada, Fletcher replied: \"I've had the conversations and the focus is on this game, then we'll speak after [Burnley].",
      "\"It all happened very quickly on Monday morning. Had a game to prepare and a very quick turnaround, a training session to organise, speak to the players so the focus has been on the Burnley match.",
      "\"It's important we give the Burnley match the respect and focus it needs to prepare the team in such a short space of time.\"",
      "Fletcher also has the strange circumstance of having his two sons - Tyler and Jack - training with the first-team squad. Midfielder Jack already made his first-team debut under Amorim.",
      "When asked if they could be handed full debuts, Fletcher started with a joke: \"I won't be disclosing team information before the game!\"",
      "He then added: \"They were in the training group on Monday because that was already arranged before I got there. They've been in the squad recently but we've got a couple of players back from injury, so we'll assess that tomorrow because of the short turnaround from games.",
      "\"They're in the periphery squad but whether they make the matchday squad, I don't know.\"",

      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 11:16, UK",

      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Michael Carrick also make our top 10.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is 11th and Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 12th - just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Recently-axed Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who has also been linked, sits 20th in our list, with a suitability score of 67.52 out of 100.",
      "Pep Guardiola was a reported target for Manchester United before his appointment at Manchester City back in 2016 but interestingly, he sits bottom of our 32-man list, with a stylistic suitability score of just 50.77 out of 100.",

      "Amorim felt United needed one or two experienced signings this January transfer window, in particular an experienced Premier League striker.",
      "Whilst differences of opinion over transfer policy wasn't the ultimate deciding factor in his departure, it did play a part in the breakdown of relationships with his bosses.",
      "Amorim felt that if he were given more resources now, that would guarantee Champions League football and even bigger financial returns. United's hierarchy have always been adamant they would not take that risk and will shun any return to short-term transfer decisions.",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 06:03, UK",
      "Liam Rosenior will watch his new team in action for the first time since being named Chelsea manager when they make the short trip to Craven Cottage to face his former club Fulham on Wednesday night. A watching brief, but there is little time to bed in.",
      "Chelsea have seven more matches to play in January even after this one, in four different competitions, with London derbies in both the domestic cups and a Champions League trip to Napoli thrown in. All while navigating the Premier League.",
      "It is called being thrown in at the deep end after stints at Hull and Strasbourg so perhaps taking the chance to watch this one from the stands is understandable, particularly after Chelsea picked up a memorable point away to Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "That last-gasp equaliser gives them a bit of momentum but Enzo Fernandez's scrappy finish was nothing compared to what Harris Reed treated the Cottage to earlier that afternoon. His even later leveller against Liverpool was a goal-of-the-season contender.",
      "Such drama is never too far away between these teams. In August, of course, Josh King had a goal controversially ruled out following an erroneous VAR check. How Fulham would love a measure of revenge by ruining Rosenior's return to take over their rivals.Adam Bate",
      "Ten games unbeaten. That is the run that Manchester City are on right now in all competitions; it is just that it does not feel quite so positive after their eight-game winning streak has ended with back-to-back draws, allowing Arsenal to pull clear again.",
      "The draw at the Stadium of Light, where Sunderland remain unbeaten this season, was one thing. Dropping two points in stoppage time at home to Chelsea was another. Pep Guardiola's side paid for their profligacy. It was sloppy. Not the mark of champions.",
      "But with Arsenal still to come to the Etihad Stadium in the spring, the onus is on City to regroup quickly and reduce the gap to three points ahead of the Gunners' game against Liverpool on Thursday. Beating Brighton at home - and preferably well - is now a must.",
      "While it felt like just a rare off night for Erling Haaland, it was perhaps a little concerning that the congested fixture list might be catching up with Rayan Cherki after his brilliant run of form. Maybe this is an opportunity for Guardiola to freshen things up in attack.",
      "Take liberties and Brighton can take advantage. After the ignominy of failing to beat West Ham twice in a month, they did win against Burnley last time out. Fabian Hurzeler's side came from behind to beat City in August. Do the double and it could be title race over.Adam Bate",
      "There is always a fascination with how teams perform after the exit of a divisive manager - sorry, Ruben, head coach - so there will be plenty of eyes on Turf Moor in one of the two later kick-offs on Wednesday evening where Manchester United return to action.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been appointed as United's interim boss, perhaps even interim to the interim boss. Will he take a minimalist approach to the role or overhaul the formation? Will he pick his son? Will he pick both sons? And will any of it actually work?",
      "In truth, Fletcher's options are limited given the list of absentees at United. He cannot even make the statement move of recalling Kobbie Mainoo with him out injured. But any kind of response to Amorim's departure - positive or negative - will bring intrigue.",
      "For Burnley, a club that now appears to be enduring rather than enjoying their Premier League return, this has to be regarded as an opportunity. Scott Parker did not like what he saw at Brighton last time out but United under the lights is a very different occasion.",
      "A record of two points from 11 games is the worst in the Premier League over that period. Burnley are still just about within touching distance of the teams above them but the turnaround will have to come quickly to save them. This would be a good time.Adam Bate",
      "Everton's mixed form at their new stadium continues after conceding four at home for the second time in four matches as they were beaten 4-2 by Brentford at the weekend. A repeat of anything like that against bottom club Wolves would spark serious scrutiny.",
      "David Moyes' side have actually picked up as many points away from the Hill Dickinson Stadium this season as they have inside it, their recent win at Nottingham Forest being their fourth of the season on the road. Doing it without Iliman Ndiaye was impressive.",
      "But if Everton are to bounce back then they will need others to step up, so amid the wreckage of that Brentford defeat it was encouraging that both misfiring strikers scored, while Jack Grealish bagged his first assists since August - against Wolves.",
      "That 3-2 win at Molineux feels an age ago now for the visitors, who are surely doomed for the drop. But Wolves boss Rob Edwards is entitled to feel a corner has been turned after a deserved point at Manchester United and that long-awaited win over West Ham.",
      "With teenage sensation Mateus Mane reenergising the Wolves supporters, it is Wolves who - improbably - come into this match with more momentum and certainly under less pressure. Back-to-back wins really would put Moyes' team under the spotlight.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace are navigating a difficult period at the moment, with Oliver Glasner currently on the worst run since he was appointed to the role in February 2024 after going seven games without a win.",
      "The Eagles have plummeted from fourth place in the Premier League on December 10, to 14th as things stand following the 2-0 defeat to Newcastle last time out.",
      "Facing a high-flying Aston Villa, who are level on points with Manchester City in second, should fill them with dread but Palace can take comfort and confidence from their recent encounters with Unai Emery's side.",
      "Unbeaten in their last six meetings with Villa across all competitions, Palace have been a constant thorn in the side of Emery and addressing their current rut with a win at Selhurst Park on Wednesday could add to this trend.",
      "On paper, it should be a routine win for Villa against a team low on confidence and form. But football isn't played on paper.",
      "The Eagles are due a win and Villa should be wary of a familiar foe getting the better of them again.Patrick Rowe",
      "After a promising start to life at Tottenham, one that had Spurs up in third after taking 17 points from the first nine games, Thomas Frank appears to have lost his way this season. Perhaps he will share some wine - and that sentiment - with Andoni Iraola.",
      "At least Iraola has credit in the bank and slightly lower expectations to deal with. Frank is facing more immediate discontent at Spurs, not least because of the style of play. The hope was that they were getting a details man, someone who would improve set pieces.",
      "Not only has the rest of the Premier League caught up with Frank in that regard this season, but his Tottenham team are not doing nearly enough in open play. In fact, they have not even scored a goal from open play in their last six games in all competitions.",
      "Newcastle will aim to win a third consecutive Premier League game for the first time this season when they host Leeds. Bruno Guimaraes is leading their resurgence.",
      "It is nothing new to see the 28-year-old inspiring the side, of course. But he has notably increased his attacking contribution this season. His goals in the wins over Crystal Palace and Burnley took him to seven in 19 Premier League games so far.",
      "He is their joint top scorer, alongside Nick Woltemade. With half of the campaign still to come, he has already matched his highest goal total in a full season for Newcastle.",
      "Guimaraes continues to play an invaluable role out of possession in Eddie Howe's midfield. But his increased attacking threat can be seen in his numbers for shots as well as goals. Guimaraes's averages this season have hit new highs.",
      "Newcastle's attack has been boosted by the return to fitness of Yoane Wissa, whose competition with Woltemade for the No 9 spot can only help. But if they find themselves in need of a goal against Leeds, their captain is the most likely candidate to step up.Nick Wright",
      "Igor Thiago's hat-trick against Everton on Sunday took him to 14 Premier League goals this season. He is the only player who even gets close to Erling Haaland in the scoring charts. Sunderland will be out to stop him at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "The Black Cats know how ruthless he can be. Thiago scored with his only effort on goal at the Stadium of Light in August, when Sunderland had to come from behind to win 2-1. But they can approach the task with confidence after a string of fine defensive displays.",
      "Sunderland have only conceded twice in their last five games. They were breached from a set piece at Spurs on Sunday but before that game they shackled Haaland impressively, inspired by centre-back duo Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete.",
      "Mukiele and Alderete rank as two of the signings of the season and there are candidates elsewhere in the Sunderland team too. Granit Xhaka has had a transformative impact in midfield. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs has arguably been even better, conceding five goals fewer than he should have, based on the quality of chances faced.",
      "Sunderland will need all four of those players to continue in the same vein against Brentford and the in-form Thiago. But, similarly to the Bees, with whom they are now vying for a European place, they have been quick to show they belong at this level.Nick Wright",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 06:03, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek card.",
      "Cristian Romero likes to defend in a manner that can quickly tip over from assertive to reckless. It's why referees know his name. Eight yellow cards and a red already this season tells its own story.",
      "Bournemouth are very good at inviting chaos that leads to cards. Andoni Iraola's side want to play quickly, get the ball into feet between the lines and force centre-backs to make decisions they don't want to make. That's where Evanilson comes in - a striker who is a genuine card magnet.",
      "Since the start of last season he's drawn 21 cards from opponents - only Bruno Guimarães has drawn more.",
      "Romero is 2/1 with Sky Bet to be carded. It's a bet.",
      "Robin Roefs has been nothing short of sensational since his £11.5m move from NEC Nijmegen in August. Seven clean sheets bagged already this season, including three in the last five games, tells the story. His save ratio of 78.4 per cent is the best in the league.",
      "Roefs leads all goalkeepers for xG prevented at +4.9, meaning he's conceded almost five goals fewer than expected and only Martin Dubravka has made more saves this season (70). Away from home across his last nine games, he's averaging 4.3 saves per 90 where those backing his 4+ saves line have landed the money in seven of those games.",
      "Brentford arrive in great nick, having taken 10 points and scored 10 goals in their last four games, and are turning games into ones where the opposition goalkeeper is constantly called into action. Roefs to make four or more saves at 10/11 with Sky Bet rates as a value play.",
      "This fixture is all about the dugout dynamic.",
      "Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner seem to know exactly how to play Aston Villa and Unai Emery. The record is startling. Palace are unbeaten in the last six meetings, winning five of them, with an aggregate score of 19-4. Pure domination.",
      "And when patterns like that persist across different game states, venues and moments in the season, it's fair to declare that Glasner has Emery's number. It's a system Villa have repeatedly struggled to solve. Every time they try to step on Palace, they get pulled into transitional chaos, exactly where Glasner's side thrive.",
      "At Selhurst Park, with Palace's recent dominance in this fixture and a manager who repeatedly outmanoeuvres his opposite number, the fact Palace are the outsiders at 2/1 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy angle to attack.",
      "Defensively, Wolves look transformed.",
      "Across their last five Premier League matches, Wolves have posted an expected goals against figure of just 1.01 per 90 - it's the second-best defensive record in the league over that sample size. And context elevates it further. This run includes games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool - fixtures that usually inflate defensive numbers rather than squeeze them. West Ham found that out on Saturday.",
      "They were restricted to scraps in terms of attacking return while for the first time this season the Wolves attack found a ruthless streak in the 3-0 win. Similar results may follow in recent weeks.",
      "Everton could struggle to find a way through making the double chance option on the away win a bet to play at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Whether it's Joao Pedro dropping in and rolling defenders or Liam Delap playing on the shoulder and inviting contact, Chelsea's forwards are excellent at turning physical battles into card parties. Fouls get drawn. And cards tend to follow.",
      "Eight centre-backs have been carded against Chelsea in their last 15 games, so Fulham defender Jorge Cuenca could be walking into a proper examination here.",
      "Cuenca's recent record suggests he's not immune to catching the referee's eye. He's been booked in two of his last four games and historically he carries a fairly punchy card profile. A 0.28 cards-per-90 ratio from his time in La Liga tells you he's a defender who plays on the front foot, happy to engage early rather than drop off. The 7/2 with Sky Bet for a Cuenca card has a chance.",
      "Brighton are not your average mid-table Premier League team when visiting the elite, and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shot bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 12 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under Fabian Hurzerler's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 14.5 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.5 expected goals per game. That is an outrageous output and one which deserves full respect in this fixture where City could be without their first-choice defensive duo in Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.",
      "The markets are behind on this shots curve. We can jump on Brighton to register 10 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet - something they have landed in their last three head-to-heads with Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore.",
      "Newcastle have scored at least twice in each of their last 11 home matches. That attacking consistency was on show again last time out when they delivered exactly what was expected by this column against Crystal Palace, where the 10/11 for a home win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals landed. No need to change a winning formula then.",
      "Expect goals, expect control and expect Newcastle to deliver in front of their own fans yet again. The 4/5 on offer through the Sky Bet BuildABet function for Newcastle to win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals remains a bet to follow.",
      "According to the Premier League title-winning odds, it's never been more likely this season than now that Arsenal will land the outright prize. After Chelsea's late salvo at Manchester City, the 1/4 on offer with Sky Bet on Arsenal for the title is the shortest price they've been all season. Only Arsenal can stop Arsenal now.",
      "For this game the under 2.5 goals line is worth a look at 11/10 with Sky Bet. Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot are cut from a similar cloth. Territory matters. Risk management matters. Neither wants a basketball match",
      "When two managers are this obsessed with control, the game often eats itself. In big games between elite managers of this nature, it often promises drama and delivers tension instead. One goal either way could be enough.",
