      "In the end, the allure of trophies is what swayed Harry Kane to Bayern Munich in the summer of 2023. Throughout his time at Tottenham, Kane was renowned as one the continent's top strikers and was on the radar of every top European club.",
      "In 2021, Kane did everything he could to try and force a move to Manchester City, including publicly stating his desire to leave Spurs during a round of golf with Gary Neville. However, he waited two more years before Bayern forked out £100m to bring him to Bavaria from North London.",
      "While Bayern won the race, Manchester United had been working on a move for the England captain for some time. When Erik ten Hag first took up the reins at United, it was exclusively revealed by the Mirror that he wanted Kane to be one of his first transfer signings. However, it was not the right time for Kane, as he was determined to become Spurs' record goalscorer.",
      "Moreover, if the England skipper was to leave, it would have been for a club that was immediately ready to challenge for the big trophies and not one that was building or in transition.",
      "After overtaking Sir Jimmy Greaves' Spurs tally the following February, United thought they had the perfect opportunity to sign Kane. Spurs finished outside the top four, during a campaign which saw Antonio Conte be sacked by the club, while United had just won the League Cup, reached the FA Cup final and finished third.",
      "Kane had also publicly said that he wanted to overtake Alan Shearer's record of scoring 260 Premier League goals, seemingly ruling out a move abroad. With City enjoying Erling Haaland's services and Liverpool signing Cody Gakpo at the time, a move to United appeared to be the only realistic Premier League move.",
      "It was a more promising situation than 12 months before when Kane was reluctant to move to Old Trafford after United's struggles under Ole Gunnar-Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. The Red Devils finished sixth with their worst points tally for 32 years and had also endured their fifth consecutive campaign without a trophy.",
      "Kane's motivation to leave Tottenham was driven by his desire to win a major trophy. At the time, the North Londoners were seemingly in a better position to win a title than United.",
      "The England frontman had decided that he would only leave Tottenham for a side that's ready to compete for big trophies immediately and not one that was in transition. Kane was impressive in his final campaign at Spurs, but their 8th placed finish meant the writing was on the wall in regard to his future.",
      "Initially, it was reported that Kane's representatives had a \"secret meeting\" with Paris Saint-Germain, who were interested in a move. PSG transfer chief Luis Campos held an \"informal conversation\" over Kane's future, according to Foot Mercato.",
      "At the time, PSG were embarking on a fresh approach to transfers and were in the process of moving Lionel Messi and Neymar on, so they could build a younger and fresher team. A move to the French capital did not suffice and with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy being reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival, Bayern Munich were in the right place at the right time.",
      "When the rumours about a move to Germany were ongoing, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy urged Kane to move to Bayern and plunder as many goals and trophies as possible. In his column for Daily Mail, Murphy said: \"If Bayern Munich come calling this summer, he should go. It would be hugely sad if a player of his quality finished [his career] without winning a trophy. It's something he himself would regret after retirement.\"",
      "He added: \"Going abroad might cost him Alan Shearer's Premier League goals record but, in the grand scheme of things, that shouldn't put him off. In five years, we could be talking about Harry Kane, Champions League winner with multiple Bundesliga titles and cup medals.",
      "\"I'm sure Kane will get other offers. Manchester United have been mentioned, but he hasn't got time to be part of a team that is building. If he was going to leave, it would be primarily to win trophies from the get-go, which would make Bayern his best option.\"",
      "Kane would go on to snub any other interest from United to secure his £100m move to Bayern. After a disappointing first season saw Bayern fail to win a trophy for the first time in a decade, Kane won the Bundesliga under Vincent Kompany, helping himself to 38 goals and 13 assists in 47 matches along the way.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Juventus have entered the race to sign Victor Osimhen, who has attracted huge interest this summer with Manchester United also keen on the Nigerian. His time at Napoli looks to be up and the Old Lady want to keep him in Italy.",
      "They've resumed talks with their arch rivals, who have just claimed the Serie A title but have backed Romelu Lukaku as their main man in attack. Osimhen spent last season out on loan with Galatasaray, where he continued to be prolific.",
      "There are a number of frontmen tipped to be on the move this summer and Gazzetta claim that Osimhen remains Juventus' primary target in attack so club representatives resumed talks with the striker’s agents in recent days.",
      "Osimhen has a €75million (£64m) release clause but that is only valid for clubs outside Serie A, which means the Bianconeri must negotiate a transfer fee with Napoli, which could prove challenging.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres, another man who is also linked with a move to Manchester, is expected to leave Sporting Lisbon but Juventus have Osimhen ahead of the Swedish striker on their own shortlist.",
      "The Nigerian has already turned down a mammoth offer from Al-Hilal, which has underlined his desire to remain in Europe. Rio Ferdinand has claimed that Osimhen \"must be waiting\" for the Premier League giants to come calling.",
      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents : \"No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen! It looks like he’s turned down Al Hilal… he must be waiting for Man United. I don’t know if Man United are going to come. That’s the problem.\"",
      "Osimhen only has a year left on his deal in Naples which will put his club under pressure to sell as the summer goes on. He has previously been linked with a move to Chelsea, but that never materialised last summer.",
      "United have already landed Matheus Cunha this summer but remain on the hunt for a No.9 having missed out on Liam Delap. Their lack of European football could hamper them in some negotiations but they retain an interest in the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Gyokeres.",

      "Manchester United's wishlist remains lengthy but the need to sell unwanted stars remains top priority if Ruben Amorim is to get the signings he desires.",
      "And while talk of Bryan Mbeumo arriving from Brentford continues, Jadon Sancho's potential exit from Old Trafford - after Chelsea paid £5m NOT to sign him permanently - remains complicated with Napoli interested but hurdles to climb regarding the financials.",
      "Nick Cox - the academy chief - is also set to depart for Everton in the coming months, once a replacement is found, having overseen the development of dozens of familiar names in the past few years.",
      "Here are the transfer tales you need to keep an eye on from in and around Old Trafford.",
      "Omar Berrada is confident Manchester United can return to the Premier League's summit by 2028. A tall order, the chief executive admitted, but very much possible.",
      "And if it is to become a reality this transfer window needs to see a shambolic squad that finished 15th in the season just completed receive some significant surgery. It has already begun following Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival from Wolves, while Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike and Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo remain high on the wishlist.",
      "Yet United have been clear for months that outgoings are a must to fund new arrivals and there is still no clarity on where Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and several others will be playing once the recruitment window closes on September 1. None of those are in head coach Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "Here is the transfer state of play at Old Trafford as things stand.",
      "United are poised to lose academy chief Nick Cox to Everton in a further blow. The Merseyside club are in advanced talks to appoint Cox as their new technical director with a deal expected to be completed imminently.",
      "Cox has been in charge of United's academy since 2019, a spell that has seen more than two dozen players including Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo graduate to first team debuts, while a host of young players developed under his watch have been sold on for an estimated £100m in profit.",
      "Cox moved to United in 2016 after spells in the academies at Watford and Sheffield United. But he is now set to make the leap to first-team football and would oversee recruitment during an exciting period at Everton.",
      "He will remain at United until a replacement is found and despite Cox's amicable departure, a hectic summer is expected at Old Trafford on the recruitment front.",
      "It is suggested that the Italian giants are struggling to finance the €25m (£21.3m) asking price that the Red Devils have put on Sancho’s head, while they would also struggle to afford his £300k-per-week wage packet.",

      "United have claimed victory in six of their last eight games on the opening day where they have had home advantage. Last term, United got off the mark with three points when Joshua Zirkzee bagged a late winning goal on his debut.",
      "Brighton and Crystal Palace have both proven to be the spoiler in recent years however. The Seagulls earned a 2-1 in 2022, while the Eagles came away 3-1 victors in 2020.",
      "And while United have enjoyed a consistent run of home matches to start their season, it means local rivals Manchester City have been dealt the opposite hand. The duo cannot play at home on the same weekend and are paired together to avoid a clash, much like Liverpool and Everton.",
      "That is to prevent the overburdening of policing and travel resources. Even outside of such pairings, the Premier League fixture selection is designed to avoid having clubs from the same area travelling on the same train lines across the Football League and the Premier League to avoid 'pinch points' on rail and road networks.",
      "City have managed the task of being on the road in the opening fixture pretty well, however. Only Tottenham, under Nuno Espirito Santo, have claimed victory against the Citizens with wins coming against Chelsea, Burnley, West Ham, Wolves, Arsenal, Brighton.",
      "The eight-times Premier League champions last played at home on the opening day against Sunderland in 2016. That day saw a late Paddy McNair own-goal earn a City victory after goals from Sergio Aguero and Jermain Defoe.",
      "United's last away trip on the first weekend of the season, also saw three points for a Manchester side. Goals from Marcus Rashford, Wayne Rooney and Ashley Young secured a 3-1 win over Bournemouth 3-1 as Chris Smalling netted an own-goal.",
      "Despite the benefit of being able to play their first game at home, United have been deemed to have the most difficult start in the Premier League. Games against Fulham, Burnley, Manchester City and Chelsea follow the Arsenal clash, with a trip to Liverpool scheduled in October."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come under fire from supporters for his decision-making at Old Trafford following a series of cost-cutting measures that has seen him slash concessions and raise prices, on top of scrapping free lunches for staff. He has also axed Sir Alex Ferguson from his ambassadorial role amid the club's perilous financial position.",

      "Now the Manchester United Supporters Trust have spoken out to condemn United chiefs for their ticket hikes, which they say are \"against the interest of fans\".",
      "\"This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans,\" the statement read. \"When the Club said they were introducing this new model for Members tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower demand games.",

The tournament in the United States would, he said, result in City and Chelsea being at a ‘huge’ disadvantage in the 2025-26 Premier League campaign.",
      "And the England manager is not the only one to think along those lines. Several times, Enzo Maresca and Pep Guardiola have voiced their major concerns over the physical and mental demands being made on their players.",
      "It might only be the slightest of consolations but perhaps the Premier League fixture schedulers have shown some sympathy for Guardiola and Maresca. Working on the basis that the three promoted teams are ranked 18th, 19th and 20th, the average finishing position from last season of City’s first six opponents next season is 13th (12.8, to be precise).",
      "That figure is 12th (11.67) for Chelsea. Just as significantly, Chelsea do not have to leave London until over a month into the campaign, a home starter against Crystal Palace being followed by a trip to West Ham before a derby with Fulham at Stamford Bridge is followed by a short hop to Brentford.",
      "Of the first six teams faced by both City and Chelsea, only two finished in last season’s Premier League top ten. Arsenal and Manchester United, on the other hand, each have four fixtures against top-ten teams in their opening six matches.",
      "And the average finishing position of their first six opponents last season was eighth (8.17). That represents a decidedly more challenging start for Ruben Amorim and Mikel Arteta - who go up against each other at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the season - than the one faced by Guardiola and Maresca.",
      "In fact, in the context of last season’s form, no team has a harder opening six-game spell than the one in front of United and Arsenal. Normally, this type of imbalance produces two predictable responses.",
      "Firstly, what’s the problem? Everyone has to play everyone twice. The simple answer is that a good start can build momentum while a bad start can undermine confidence. A bad start can cost a manager his job, don’t forget.",
      "A second retort usually involves the old cliche about the Premier League is a competition in which everyone can beat everyone and that there are no easy games in the Premier League. And there is simply no truth in those assertions.",
      "Between them, Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton managed to record only 12 victories from their combined 114 Premier League games last season. Four of those 12 wins came in games against each other.",
      "They had a combined goal difference of minus 153. There ARE easy matches in the Premier League and they normally come against teams promoted from the Championship.",
      "That is why Nottingham Forest fans and manager Nuno Espírito Santo will be satisfied with their schedule as they face two promoted teams in their opening six fixtures. Forest’s start looks as relatively inviting as City’s and Chelsea’s but Maresca and Guardiola will, understandably, remind everyone of their summer workload if it is suggested they have some sort of advantage.",
      "But what is for certain is that the Premier League schedule, by its very nature, cannot be completely fair. And this time, it is Amorim and Arteta who have been dealt the trickiest hands.",

      "The Gunners and Manchester United have both been heavily linked with the Sporting Lisbon striker, 27, after watching Gyokeres enjoy another stellar campaign with the Portuguese champions. And it emerged last week that Gyokeres' preference is a move to the Emirates, rather than Old Trafford.",
      "With news breaking in Germany on Wednesday that Arsenal have 'reached an agreement on personal terms' with Sesko, it seems Gyokeres could be the odd man out this summer.",
      "Arsenal's play for Sesko follows reports in Portugal that Real Madrid were offered the former Coventry City man's services. But Los Blancos are in the market for back-up striker, rather than someone who would command a significant first-team role like Gyokeres, and will not be signing him.",
      "It remains to be seen if Gyokeres would reconsider - or be more inclined to negotiate - a move to Manchester United, who have turned their attention to Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike, but are monitoring the possibility of a reunion for Gyokeres and head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils are unable to offer European football, which is thought to be one of the reasons Gyokeres initially favoured a move to Arsenal. But he may eventually end up with little choice, with a number of Gyokeres' supposed preferred options this summer - Liverpool, PSG, Manchester City and Barcelona among them - just not in the market for the Swedish hitman.",
      "And, unfortunately for Gyokeres - and potentially United - there are other elements at play, too: Sporting have refuted claims that the striker is available for less than his release clause, with tensions now at an all-time high.",

      "Federico Varandas, the Sporting president, has already gone public to take aim at the player's agent and to make it clear that Gyokeres will not be sold on the cheap. He: \"One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "It's a long summer and there are a lot of twists and turns to come. But as it stands, Viktor Gyokeres future is anything but certain - and there is an increasingly more likely scenario where he is left with nowhere to go.",

      "The fixture list for the 2025-26 Premier League season has officially been released, and every club vying for top-flight supremacy has found out their potential paths to glory. Liverpool enter the new campaign as reigning champions, after Arne Slot delivered them the crown in his debut term.",
      "Arsenal, who have played second fiddle for the past three seasons, will be hoping to go one better this campaign, and have an early chance to prove their worth when they head to Old Trafford on the opening weekend before a trip to Anfield in late August. They'll host rivals Tottenham in November, with the reverse North London Derby taking place in early February.",
      "Manchester City will have enforcer Rodri back in action for the new season, and take on Wolves during the league's opening weekend, with a Manchester Derby to look forward to in September, as well as a battle with the Gunners one week later.",
      "As was the case last year, the new campaign will officially get up and running on a Friday evening in August, when Liverpool host Bournemouth at Anfield as the reigning Premier League champions on August 15.",
      "This also remains in line with the Premier League's return to a later start date after several years of slightly earlier restarts. Next term will begin a full 11 days after the 2022-23 campaign got underway, though that was motivated by the Qatar World Cup interrupting the schedule midway through the calendar.",
      "It also means teams will have to play less football before the summer transfer window closes on September 1. Many have urged organisers to shut the transfer window before the season gets underway at all, though this timing still leaves clubs with a fortnight to do business after the campaign starts.",
      "The Premier League will continue to adhere to a more manageable workload for players in 2025/26. After being pressured to fall in line with the scheduling policies of countries like Germany and Spain, England's elite will also have more respite over the Christmas and New Year period.",
      "This means no two rounds will take place within 60 hours of each other, a decision made to ease the burden on players during a congested part of the calendar. It also means that for the second season in a row, there will be no fixtures played on Christmas Eve.",
      "Anticipation will also be high around this time of year as the winter transfer window returns. The opening for clubs to conclude mid-season business will open on January 1, 2026 and close on February 2.",
      "Between August and May, the Premier League will host matchdays across 33 weekends and five midweek rounds. It's also now guaranteed that players will have 83 clear rest days over the course of those nine months, where no games are played.",
      "The campaign will conclude with 10 simultaneous kick-offs on Sunday, May 24. This has been scheduled to leave enough time ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which gets underway on June 11."

      "Later that evening, the well-known player, drink in hand and clad in diamonds, was in a nightclub stood on a table with a microphone in hand. His team had only drawn earlier in the day.",
      "In Moneyball, Brad Pitt's Billy Beane takes a dim view of the Oakland A's first baseman Jeremy Giambi dancing on a table to Give Up The Funk. After instructing Giambi to get back down to earth, Beane aggressively asks, \"Is losing fun?\"",
      "\"No,\" Giambi eventually mutters.",

      "A few scenes later, Giambi is traded. Jonah Hill's Peter Brand, Beane's assistant and sole ally, is aghast: \"What are you doing?\"",
      "\"Cleaning house.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is not the only recent United manager who might have watched Moneyball and noticed parallels. Like Pitt, Amorim likes to hit the gym. He is also about to clean the house.",
      "Those who know Amorim are struck by how stubborn he is. \"He never changes,\" a confidant said. \"He will die with his idea.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all have to go. Sancho does not have a squad number, Antony is not an option for printing on the club's online store and Rashford is expected to have his number 10 revoked and reassigned to Matheus Cunha. Amorim told Garnacho he can go.",
      "Last week, Rashford's Instagram account uploaded a two-week itinerary for June. Nine out of 14 days were tagged 'Gym, pitch'. Pitching for a new club.",
      "Young United fans have idolised Rashford and many still do. He was not as domineering a presence as Paul Pogba during the club's player-power period or indulged as much as Anthony Martial, which made his transgressions under Amorim and Erik ten Hag - after the latter had restored authority to the United manager's role - so disappointing.",
      "After Sir Alex Ferguson did a U-turn and delayed his retirement in 2002, a United player turned to Dwight Yorke, in exile but optimistic ahead of the apparently impending managerial change. \"That's you f*****d, Yorkie.\" Yorke laughed. Rashford knows there is no route back at United with Amorim in charge.",
      "Ten Hag stood up to Cristiano Ronaldo, so Sancho was always going to be small-fry after he publicly accused the Dutchman of lying. Hardly any teammates sympathised with Sancho and urged him to reoncile with Ten Hag. He never did.",
      "Amorim looked bemused when he was incongruously asked in February whether Sancho could have a future at United. \"Jadon Sancho is not my problem.\" He is now.",
      "United need £14.58m to avoid a loss on Sancho under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. It was amusing, for a while, that Chelsea had agreed an obligation to pay up to £25m for Sancho until someone at Stamford Bridge reached for a calculator.",
      "Antony, La Liga-worthy and back in the Brazil squad, has a higher resale value than Sancho but only a handful of clubs would be in the market for the winger and have the financial wherewithal to hit the magic £32.52m mark. Antony has created a market for himself but United may have to tolerate another season-long loan, burnished by a loan fee and an obligation or option to buy.",
      "Of the four forwards in the departures' lounge, Garnacho is the most regrettable. He could not see the wood for the trees in the days leading up to the Europa League final, despite the giveaway that he would be benched when he was named as a substitute five days beforehand at Chelsea. That marked the first time he had been benched for successive games since January.",
      "Garnacho came on at 0-0, defended fecklessly for Marc Cucurella's winner, was rollocked by Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire and still got his hair bleached on the eve of the final. He very deliberately remained on the San Mames pitch, chewing the fat with Sergio Reguilon, as the United team was announced with all of his teammates were in the dressing room.",
      "Most United punters would have started Garnacho against Tottenham. That he didn't does not excuse his post-match petulance. Speaking in his native tongue, he cast doubt on his future.",
      "It felt telling that in the United corporate section for the semi-final at Athletic Bilbao, the only players whose agents were visibly present were Garnacho's and Kobbie Mainoo's. Garnacho's representatives, Enrique de Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro, appear to have been largely useless in advising their client on his social media etiquette. They made everyone aware they were at Chelsea in January when the club considered bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho all but confirmed his bench berth hours before the Europa League final with a passive aggressive post of his FA Cup final goal. He was at it again when United touched down in Manchester after the tempestuous post-season tour. Garnacho uploaded a picture of the Manchester Airport tarmac with the word \"Finally\", accompanied by crying-with-laughter and praying emojis. Whenever he grows up, it will be away from United.",
      "De Lucas and Cambeiro have allowed Garnacho's sense of entitlement to inflate. He and other puerile teammates had to be told to stop raising their middle fingers for photographs in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Garnacho left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium with sunglasses on at gone 11.30pm at night. He blanked everyone as he strolled through the mixed zone and he looked downright miserable when ordered to fulfil meet-and-greet duties post-match in Hong Kong.",
      "Pogba revelled in Jose Mourinho's sacking on Twitter and was never disciplined. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was well-liked by United players but they also found him to be a soft touch. He had a tendency to squirm whenever the topic turned to Pogba.",
      "Rashford's working relationship with Solskjaer was not as rosy towards the end and he was particularly dismayed by the handling of his shoulder injury towards the end of the 2020-21 season. Solskjaer also sensed a shift in Rashford's demeanour amid a nationwide love-in over his free school meals campaign.",
      "United could not have foresawn Rashford's form nosediving after a career-best season but there were red flags. An antagonistic story the day after he was benched for the Manchester derby in March 2022, his brother's public dalliance with Paris Saint-Germain and a significant change to his entourage.",
      "Dwaine Maynard, Rashford's brother, also rejoiced in Mourinho's misfortune on social media, deriding his reaction to a Rashford miss the day after Rashford netted a matchwinning double against Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "When Beane trades Giambi in Moneyball, the conversation lasts 23 seconds. Some of United's planned departees do not merit a goodbye as long as that."

      "After joining Manchester United from Chelsea for an initial fee of £55million in July 2023, Mason Mount wasted no time in declaring his best position.",
      "\"I've always seen myself as a midfielder or a No.8 that can obviously get forward, attack, try and score goals and create goals,\" he told MUTV.",
      "\"But I am also able to do the other side as well and defend and help the team when we're under pressure.\"",
      "United signed Mount to add energy to their midfield and become a long-term replacement for Christian Eriksen in the No.8 position. The Dane excelled in his debut season at Old Trafford in 2022/23 but it was clear United needed younger legs in that area of the team.",
      "Operating in a 4-3-3 formation under former manager Erik ten Hag at the time, Mount was expected to join forces with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in United's first-choice midfield. Casemiro had enjoyed an outstanding first season at the club after arriving from Real Madrid in August 2022 and was, at the time, one of the very first names on the teamsheet.",
      "However, Mount's first season in M16 was ravaged by injuries, restricting him to just 20 appearances in all competitions. He played just 14 times in the Premier League, making five starts.",
      "As a result, it was impossible to make a firm judgement on if he would be the ideal long-term replacement for Eriksen. It was hoped the 2024/25 campaign would be much kinder to him on the injury front.",
      "However, the fact he only managed to make 26 appearances in the most recent campaign meant that wish failed to become a reality. A serious hamstring issue sidelined him between mid-December and the beginning of April.",
      "Despite his unavailability, he regularly earned praise from United head coach Ruben Amorim, who declared his admiration for the England international after replacing Ten Hag last November.",
      "He said: \"Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid. You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.",
      "\"I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he's trying to stay fit and we hope he can continue to be fit, to show all the talent that he's shown, for example, in Chelsea.\"",
      "Well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation from his time at Stamford Bridge, there was always a chance Mount could flourish under Amorim, and there was evidence of that towards the end of the campaign.",
      "In Amorim's system, Mount is deployed as one of the two No.10s and not as a No.8. He is a perfect fit the former Sporting Lisbon boss, although he was originally signed to play as a No.8, albeit in a 4-3-3.",
      "Having already added Matheus Cunha to their ranks this summer and attempting to sign Bryan Mbeumo, United could start the new season with a plethora of options to occupy either of the playmaker spots. Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad are all capable of playing as a No.10.",
      "If signed, Mbeumo could be a shoo-in to occupy the right-sided No.10 spot amid the expectation Cunha will command the alternative No.10 spot, meaning Mount may not be a guaranteed starter.",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim values him enormously and he is a good option to be able to bring off the bench. He fits the system perfectly and Mount will be hungry to make up for lost time."

      "That form saw him called up for Germany's senior side before dropping back into the under-21 side as he bids to win a European championship medal.",
      "The giant forward stands at six foot six inches tall and would perhaps be the perfect foil for Cunha and United transfer target Bryan Mbeumo in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation.",

      "Eleven league fixtures have been tagged category B, priced between £57 and £86, two are in the C band (£37-£60) while domestic cup fixtures are the D category (£32-£52). Junior and senior concessions remain in place and the categorisation only applies to match-by-match ticket members and not season ticket holders.",
      "United sources say the new structure reflects the reality of large variations in demand and attractiveness between different fixtures and that they have prioritised their most loyal fans in season-ticket holders and under-16 matchgoers.",
      "The Manchester United Supporters' Trust claims the fans' forum and the fans' advisory board (FAB) were not properly consulted on the new structure and that the price of the cheapest ticket for most league games has risen by more than 50 per cent. United sources say the figures were presented to the FAB, who requested a review.",
      "The new measure comes after United supporters fumed at least season's mid-season ticket-price hike to £66. Several supporters also demonstrated against the club's decision to relocate their season tickets in favour of a new hospitality section in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Old Trafford.",
      "United endured their worst season in 51 years in 2024-25, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, who had last lifted silverware in 2008.",
      "A source said the categorisation introduction has kept season-ticket prices lower than what United had initially proposed.",
      "MUST said in a statement: “After how last season went, we might have hoped the club would reconsider their plans for this new ticketing model which will see eye-watering price increases for 20,000 supporters per game who buy tickets on a match-by-match basis. This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans.",
      "\"When the club said they were introducing this new model for members' tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower demand games.",
      "\"Once again, they have failed to consult any of the fans representative bodies on the details of the decision, and once again they’re making choices against the interests of fans and, we believe, the club as a whole.",
      "“The club's stated commitment to fan representation is fine in principle, but once again is not being delivered in practice. The structure is in place, and the fans' forum and FAB representatives are doing their job, but the club are not adhering to their previous commitment to proper consultation and that needs to change and change fast.",
      "“What Manchester United needs next season is a united fanbase and club, with the team on the pitch supported by loyal and vocal fans roaring it back after the disaster that was last year.",
      "\"These ticketing decisions only push those regular supporters away in favour of occasional visitors and risk pricing out the next generation of younger fans who are the very future of the club.",

      "According to Marca, Rashford is willing to present himself as the cheaper option to Barca than their other targets Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",

      "Speaking to Betway, Lescott explained:",
      "I don’t want to sound disrespectful, but I think they can replace him. I think they have a strong enough team and style, and I think Unai Emery’s proven that. They haven’t missed any player, really, they’ve been able to rotate, add, take away, suffer injuries. Martinez is top, very, very good, but I think if they acquire someone with experience, I think that’s key – the experience of who comes in to play that position, because they’re still relatively young at the back. That experience can add an amount of calm. I think it’s a loss, 100 per cent, but I don’t think it derails them where there’s question marks asked about whether they can achieve similar things to this season.",
      "A new twist in the Emi Martinez saga unfolded last night when it was reported by GiveMeSport that the Aston Villa goalkeeper had offered his services to United this summer.",
      "It is thought that Villa would be reluctant to see the Argentine leave their club but are wary of potentially breaching profit and sustainability rules if they do not sell him.",

      "On his namesake podcast this week, Ferdinand renewed his calls to bring in the striker",
      "No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen! It looks like he’s turned down Al-Hilal… he must be waiting for Manchester United. I don’t know if Manchester United are going to come. That’s the problem.",

      "The 19-year-old spent the second half of the 2024/25 season on loan with Walsall, but struggled for game time. However, he is not thinking about his short term future.",
      "\"I’m just more concentrated on this tournament,\" he told PA Sport. “But, yeah, since [Ruben Amorim came in, I was away with international camp and, obviously, went on loan in January, so I’ve not really been around it too much.",
      "\"But I want to be a Man United player in the future. If that doesn’t happen, then it obviously wasn’t meant to be. We’ll just see what happens in the future.\"",
      "He added: \"Even if my first [loan move] didn’t go well - and it didn’t - I had it in the back of my head,\" he added. \"And I was telling staff around the club, it’s not going to define me as a player.",

They are talking to the club, always in contact with player agents, and with an agreement with Bryan Mbeumo, because the player wants to go to United.",

      "Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the ex-United centre-back expressed his pleasure at the business that has been done and a deal that is expected to be done shortly.",
      "I’m happy with Cunha, he’s one of the ones I mentioned on my list. I hope it goes well for him. The problem is that I’ve been happy many times in transfer windows and it’s gone wrong. I’m hoping he’s not going to be added to that list. If they get Mbeumo, I’d be very happy because he wants to come. Mbeumo wants to come, I know it. His stats over the last three seasons in the Premier League are up there, by the way. Goals and assists, goal chances, ridiculous.",
      "According to Record, Gyokeres' camp has turned down the opportunity to enter talks with Sporting to clear the air.",
      "After much confusion surrounding the amount Sporting are willing to let Gyokeres leave for, it is believed the Swede was left furious about a perceived back track from the Lisbon club's perspective.",

      "City, Liverpool, Real, Barca, PSG and Bayern have not shown any real interest in him so far.",

      "The Turkish international has struggled since his arrival at Old Trafford from Fenerbahce during the 2023 summer window.",

      "The Polish goalkeeper has struggled since that move and the report claims United have offered Bayindir's services. However, it also adds that they aren't the only Turkish club to have been approached and that a deal may be difficult claiming the United shot stopper doesn't want to return to the Super Lig.",
      "Sport Bild claims Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Arsenal are the main players in the race to sign Xavi Simons this summer.",
      "The German outlet claims that the Premier League quartet are all interested in signing the Dutch playmaker who scored 11 goals and notched eight assists in 33 games for RB Leipzig last season.",
      "However, Simons has a reported €70m (£59.8m) asking price. That being said, the report claims the player's brother Faustino has been in talks with the Premier League clubs, along with Barcelona.",
      "Given how much United could spend on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, another big-money signing looks unrealistic.",
      "BILD have reported that Arsenal have 'reached an agreement' with RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old has been the Gunners' top target this summer on the back of scoring 21 goals last season.",
      "The report in Germany claims that the Gunners have come to an agreement with the Slovenian on personal terms. There is still work to be done with Leipzig but it's suggested that the north Londoners have signalled they will make an offer that won't be below their £85.5m valuation."

      "Cox joined United in 2016 and stepped up to lead their academy in 2019. Under Cox's guidance, United won the FA Youth Cup in 2022, recruited Alejandro Garnacho from Atletico Madrid and Kobbie Mainoo emerged into the first team. Ethan Wheatley became United's 250th academy graduate when he came on against Sheffield United in April 2024.",
      "Everton have headhunted Cox as part of their restructuring under new owners the Friedkin Group. Angus Kinnear was appointed the club's new chief executive last month.",
      "United sources say Cox rejected various technical director and sporting director roles in the past. Cox will remain at the club for the coming months to ensure there is a smooth transition and a succession play is already underway.",
      "Since Cox was chosen to run the academy over Nicky Butt, 27 academy players have made their debut for the United first team. Garnacho and Mainoo scored in the 2-1 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City last year.",
      "Cox held video calls with Garnacho and his family to convince him to relocate from Madrid to Manchester at the age of 16 in 2020. United also recruited Alvaro Fernandez and Willy Kambwala that year. The pair were sold to Benfica and Villarreal last summer.",
      "Other notable academy recruits during Cox's time include Harry Amass, Chido Obi and Darren Fletcher's twin sons, Jack and Tyler.",
      "United had gone 11 years without winning the Youth Cup until they defeated Nottingham Forest in the 2022 final at Old Trafford, where a record crowd of 67,492 for the competition was in attendance.",
      "Staff at United credit Cox with implementing enhancements in processes and culture that have raised the standards of an academy that had stagnated in the years after Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Following Brian McClair's departure as academy head, it was jointly run by John Murtough and former club secretary John Alexander in 2015.",
      "After Cox received the director of academy title in 2022, he also became a member of United's clandestine football leadership group.",

There he was able to make an impact with four goals and six assists in 17 matches, thus reinforcing the message that perhaps his future lies anywhere besides this new dawn at Old Trafford.",
      "Villa had a £40m option to make their loan permanent but did not act on it, meaning it will fall on United to find a different club to sell to if this summer is going to produce the definitive parting of ways.",
      "Sporting director Deco has even told Catalan radio station RAC1 last month: \"We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players.\"",
      "It just so turns out as that situation has developed, it is one of those 'other players' that the La Liga side may progress towards signing instead of the United forward. Athletic Bilbao prospect and Spanish international Nico Williams appears to have emerged as their new top target, personally vying for the move.",
      "In a new update from Marca, Rashford is apparently not going to give up on his dream move to Barca whilst there is still a fighting chance.",
      "They say he is eager to become Barca player at the end of this saga and claim he is willing to supplement the fact that his price tag would likely be smaller than Williams' by making 'sacrifices', including those financially.",
      "That appears to a be a hint towards the England attacker slashing his wage demands in order to appear a more attractive option over the Bilbao and Liverpool options.",
      "Rashford, 27, earns £325,000-a-week at United and his salary has so far prevented him from leaving the club having previously outlined his desire for a \"new challenge\".",

      "He shared his training regime to his Instagram followers, showing that between Monday, June 9 and this coming Sunday, June 22, he will have had only three days off where he has not worked out in some capacity. Nine days were dedicated to gym sessions and on the pitch while two further days will be focused solely in the gym.",

      "Last summer, for example, United completed three of their five summer signings after the tour. Only Leny Yoro went to the US after Joshua Zirkzee was granted a period of leave after representing the Netherlands at the European Championship in Germany earlier in the summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha is United's only new addition so far this summer after recently arriving from Wolves for £62.5million, but the club is hopeful of adding Bryan Mbeumo to the dressing room sooner rather than later.",
      "The Brentford star, despite also attracting interest from Tottenham Hotspur, has told confidants that his preferred destination is Old Trafford. United saw an opening offer of £45million plus £10m in add-ons turned down earlier this month, but talks between the two clubs remain open.",
      "United would like to sign the Cameroonian, who scored 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, by the time pre-season starts in early-July, meaning United are in a battle against the clock to get him through the door.",
      "Signing Mbeumo would add another piece to United's jigsaw. They have made strengthening their attack a leading priority this summer and they would be two thirds of the way towards completing that objective if they were to sign the Brentford ace.",
      "However, the biggest challenge United face this summer is recruiting a No.9. They are in desperate need of a goalscorer and failing to sign one isn't an option.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, United's search for a striker could head in a number of different directions. They are being linked with a plethora of names, such as Viktor Gyokeres, Hugo Ekitike and Victor Osimhen.",
      "However, landing the statement striker they are in such desperate need of is not going to be an easy or straightforward task.",
      "United are also dependent on player sales to raise cash to fund new additions. If they sign Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m, they will then be reliant on departures to strengthen other areas of the squad.",
      "There is an obvious need for a midfielder and a goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana, but recruiting an established No.9 has to take priority. United scored just 44 league goals last season and have finished the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Having been without Zirkzee, despite him turning out not to be a No.9, on last summer's tour, and Rasmus Hojlund arriving after the tour the previous year, United can ill-afford to go another pre-season campaign without a recognised No.9 in their ranks.",
      "Amorim would love to be able to take his new starting striker to the US with him and give him the opportunity to get used to his new teammates, learn the system and attempt to settle himself in before the competitive action starts against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "But for that ambition to become a reality, United are going to have to identify their top target to spearhead their attack and step up their efforts in the market to fund his arrival. Neither are impossible tasks, but the countdown is most definitely on."

      "Limited to just one substitute appearance in the Carabao Cup in the first half of the campaign just gone, Wheatley moved to Sky Bet League Two side Walsall in January, seeking regular first-team action.",

      "\"My second half of season has been frustrating, not being able to show what I'm about, really,\" Wheatley shared with the PA news agency. \"But I think this tournament is the perfect way to do it.",
      "\"I think there'll be a lot of eyes on it and representing your country in a Euros, there's not much better than that.",
      "\"It'll be good to hopefully impress and, just for myself and for the team, play my part and do well.",
      "\"The club have been good with me. They've let me come back and play a few 21s games just to keep my legs going, so it's been good to be back at United, developing and getting game-time.\"",
      "United staff are reportedly baffled by Walsall's handling of Wheatley, who netted a crucial goal for his country in an astonishing Under-19s Euros tie on Tuesday.",
      "England were reeling with a 5-1 deficit shortly after half-time, when the forward ignited an incredible fightback to a 5-5 draw, as focus shifts to Friday's decisive group match with Group B leaders the Netherlands.",
      "Wheatley exhibited exceptional maturity and confidence, which echoed his demeanour at the team's Romanian base, where he seemed resolute despite difficulties experienced at Walsall.",
      "\"Even if my first loan too didn't go well - and it didn't - I had it in the back of my mind, and I was telling staff around the club, it's not going to define me as a player,\" he added.",
      "\"It's not going to judge where I end up in the future. I think it's just like a little blip in my early career, and hopefully I can just bounce back from it going into next season.\"",
      "Former United manager, Erik ten Hag, was fond of Wheatley and brought him into last summer's pre-season tour squad, in addition to selecting him for three Premier League appearances, yet it's uncertain what plans new head coach Ruben Amorim has for the young talent.",
      "When quizzed about his prospects, the United striker added: \"As of now, no, not really. I'm just more concentrated on this tournament. But, yeah, since [Amorim] came in I was away with international camp and, obviously, went on loan in January, so I've not really been around it too much.",
      "\"But I do want to be a United player in the future, but if that doesn't happen then it obviously wasn't meant to be. We'll just see what happens in the future.\""

He also turned provider on six occasions with all of those coming in positive outcomes for Napoli and thus it was no surprise he won player of the season.",

      "If this summer's transfer window has already taught us anything, it's that signing a striker is not going to be an easy task for Manchester United.",
      "After seeing top target Liam Delap join Chelsea, United have been left with no choice but to explore alternative avenues in their hunt for a goal-getter.",
      "Delap, despite not being the proven and established No.9 United are in such desperate need of this summer, was an attainable target due to the £30million release clause that had been inserted into his Ipswich Town contract following his arrival from Manchester City last summer.",
      "Delap scored 12 goals in his first full season as a Premier League striker and was not light on suitors as a result. His release clause and his potential made him an attractive option.",
      "However, it goes without saying that United need a proven goalscorer this summer. They gambled on potential with Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 and did exactly the same with Joshua Zirkzee last year.",
      "Neither player arrived at Old Trafford with a proven goalscoring record and that is why United are in such desperate need of an established goalscorer for the third summer transfer window running. However, securing a proven goalscorer is an easier said than done task.",
      "United have been linked with a flurry of strikers in recent weeks, both domestically and abroad, including Jean-Philippe Mateta of Crystal Palace, Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres, Napoli's Victor Osimhen and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and remaining hopeful of signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo for a potentially similar fee, United do not have a bottomless pit to turn to this summer in their quest to sign a No.9, meaning they may have no choice but to distance themselves from the more premium and luxurious names.",
      "Sporting want top dollar for Gyokeres, who has reportedly chosen Arsenal as his preferred destination, and Osimhen has set eye-watering wage demands. With that said, United may have to look further afield in their search for a centre-forward, and one name they could consider adding to their shortlist is Atletico Madrid striker Alexander Sorloth.",
      "The Norwegian, once of Palace, joined Atletico from La Liga counterparts Villarreal just under a year ago for a fee reportedly in the region of £30m and scored 24 goals in his debut season at the Metropolitano Stadium, meaning he has netted 50 goals in the last two seasons.",
      "Having scored 24 goals for Atletico in 2024/25, the idea of them selling the 29-year-old and for a reasonable price may feel somewhat fanciful. However, the Spanish outfit's attacking options also consist of Julian Alvarez, Antoine Griezmann and Angel Correa, meaning they are not short on options.",
      "Despite ending the season as Atletico's second highest goalscorer, only coming second to Alvarez, who netted 29, Sorloth did not play as prominent a role as he would have liked. Of his 35 La Liga appearances, 20 of them were via the bench.",
      "Despite proving to be effective as an impact player, scoring 12 league goals after coming off the bench, Sorloth will believe his exploits in front of goal would have been worthy of more opportunities as a starter. There is a chance he could become increasingly frustrated if he continues to be utilised as an impact substitute by Atletico boss Diego Simeone.",
      "At United, he would be a guaranteed starter amid their need for a goalscorer. After a disappointing stint at Palace between 2018 and 2020, the Norwegian has found his feet in Spain, scoring 74 goals in 182 games for Real Sociedad, Villarreal and Atletico combined.",
      "His record is by no means as impressive as Gyokeres' or Osimhen's, for example, but few would categorise him alongside those two as being among Europe's elite strikers.",

      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",

      "Nevertheless, his haul of 66 goals over the last three seasons is worthy of recognition. The elephant in the room is that he failed to cut it in England with Palace, scoring just once in 20 appearances, but he has developed and matured since arriving at Selhurst Park as a 22-year-old in 2018.",
      "With Cunha already in situ and Mbeumo being targeted, they would be able to help ease the burden on Sorloth and assist with United's attacking output.",
      "With no obvious answer to United's striker search currently available, Sorloth could be a suitable fit if the price is right."

      "Manchester United have been given a free path to finally sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer following reports that Tottenham had cooled their interest.",
      "United are pursuing a move for the 25-year-old after already landing Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian's £62.5million release clause at Wolves was triggered by United to make him the first signing of the summer.",
      "Mbeumo is understood to have been identified as a priority for Ruben Amorim to bolster the Portuguese's attack. The Brentford star scored an impressive 20 goals in the Premier League last term.",
      "However, Thomas Frank's move to Tottenham has sparked some concern over the deal. Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford although United have already failed with an opening bid worth £45million plus £10m in add-ons.",
      "Now, it seems that United have a vital green light to get the deal over the line. Journalist Rudy Galetti has claimed that they have cooled their interest in Mbeumo and are unlikely to pursue a deal due to his preference to move to United.",
      "Galetti has also reported that agreeing personal terms with Mbeumo isn't an issue for United. The details with Brentford remain the final stumbling block, and the journalist has claimed that a fee is close to narrowing and being finalised.",
      "Reports have suggested that Brentford want £60m for Mbeumo, and it now seems that United are the only real horse in the race to sign him. After the Cameroon international puts pen to paper, focus will turn to selling players.",
      "On the back of his successful loan spell, Antony continues to be tipped for a return to Real Betis. Marcus Rashford's future remains unclear, and recent reports have suggested that United will accept just £20m for Jadon Sancho.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has claimed that United are prioritising a permanent move for the winger before considering another loan. Napoli are said to be interested, but his salary could prove to be an issue."

      "A transfer insider has suggested that the impending signing of Bryan Mbeumo at Manchester United means there’s a “limited” chance their top scorer keeps his role, but he feels he’ll be “immense” elsewhere.",
      "United have already moved to rectify their forward issues this summer. Last season, during their 15th-placed Premier League campaign, they scored 44 goals in 38 games.",
      "They have signed Matheus Cunha to add some firepower, and Bryan Mbeumo could follow, after 20 goals for Brentford last season.",
      "There’s a battle ongoing between United and Tottenham for the forward, but it’s believed Mbeumo wants to join the Red Devils, while a recent report suggested Spurs had ‘cooled’ their interest as they saw the deal to beat the rival side as ‘impossible’.",
      "That signing, and other United decisions, while push Amad Diallo out of his role, according to insider Graeme Bailey.",
      "He told TBRFootball: “Amad probably knows he’s heading towards playing the right wing-back role.",
      "“If you recall, in [Ruben] Amorim’s first game in charge against Ipswich Town, that’s where Amad played. When he says right wing-back role, a wing-back role in a Ruben Amorim system is not the wing-back role that we usually associate with English football.",
      "“I think the Cunha and Mbeumo signings, and [Joshua] Zirkzee still being there, tell us that the chances of Amad playing as an attacking midfielder are quite limited next season.",
      "“We might see Amad play in that right-side role, that’s what [the transfer moves] are telling us. We know Amad is prepared to play there, he’s done it a number of times for Amorim, and let’s not forget the players who played that position for Amorim – [Geovany] Quenda at Sporting and look how good he is. He’s not a dissimilar type of player.",
      "“It tells us that, while he likely won’t play an attacking-midfield role at United, Amad is still very much in Amorim’s thinking. It’s a position, if they do it right, he’ll become an immense threat in, that [right wing-back] role.”",
      "Diallo was United’s joint-top scorer in the Premier League last season, with eight goals alongside eight assists, and a nunber of those came from the attack.",
      "However, he also showed he was capable of starring in the wing-back position. Amad scored a hat-trick against Southampton in a game he started as a wing-back, and there were more goals and assists in other games he played there, too.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the striker he “wants” the Red Devils to sign is “waiting” for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are among the three clubs in the race to sign Nottingham Forest standout Callum Hudson-Odoi.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have edged closer to making their next signing as Tottenham Hotspur have ‘cooled’ their interest.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur are ‘growing in confidence’ as they look to sign a Premier League winger also linked with Manchester United.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is a player in demand and Tottenham Hotspur’s appointment of Thomas Frank might have affected Manchester United’s hopes of making him their next big summer signing."

      "Manchester United have been handed a boost in their bid to sign a replacement for Andre Onana as a £40m star has ‘offered himself’ to the Red Devils in a ‘major twist’.",
      "It was claimed back in April that Onana had been ‘sentenced’ to the Old Trafford exit, with Nice’s Marcin Bułka and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez among a whole host of goalkeepers linked with a move to replace the Cameroonian.",
      "But transfer expert Ben Jacobs told GIVEMESPORT last week that the United bosses hadn’t yet decided whether to source a new stopper or retain Onana as first choice.",
      "The report stated:",
      "‘Onana went on holiday focused on Manchester United as he has not been warned that he is for sale or at risk of losing his regular starting berth, GMS sources understand, but influential figures are assessing the market and will communicate their decision to him after the initial plan was to bring in a replacement for Altay Bayindir ahead of his expected exit.’",
      "A report on Monday then claimed that they have made their minds up, or rather Amorim has made the decision for them – Onana will remain United’s No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Portuguese boss has ‘conveyed to the board his intention to count on him as a key piece in his project’ and ‘does not contemplate any other alternative’.",
      "It’s claimed Amorim ‘trusts’ Onana and still sees him as the ‘ideal profile’ to build from the back thanks to his ‘technical conditions and ability to play with his feet’.",
      "He insists that Onana can ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure and a well-defined idea of the game’, but the United boss may have his head turned now that Villa’s Martinez ‘has offered himself’ to the club.",
      "GIVEMESPORT claim the World Cup winner wants to join the Red Devils and that Villa ‘have refused to rule out reluctantly granting his wish due to fears of breaching the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules’.",
      "Martinez looked as though he was waving goodbye to the Villa fans after victory over Tottenham last month in their final home game of the season and ‘in a major twist, Martinez has made it clear that he is willing to join Manchester United if they make an approach’.",
      "The report claims Villa want £40m for the 32-year-old as they use AC Milan’s £25m valuation of Mike Maignan amid interest from Chelsea in the France international, ‘complicating matters for Manchester United and Martinez’, though it’s thought Villa do need to sanction big sales amid their PSR concerns.",
      "Maignan has just a year left to run on his deal while Martinez is under contract at Villa park until 2029.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘GMS sources have been informed that Manchester United have still not made a final call on whether to sign a new first-choice option between the sticks or if Andre Onana is surplus to requirements, while Atletico Madrid has been pinpointed as another possible destination for Martinez if Jan Oblak leaves.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their ‘preferred’ replacement for Andre Onana and all parties are open to the transfer.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘initiated talks’ to sign an elite goalkeeper target, after an ‘agreement’ killed the chances of a Barcelona deal.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly looking to bring in a new goalkeeper over the summer with the Red Devils turning their attention to a Poland international."

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "19) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "20) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",

And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli.

      "14) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nApparently, Napoli have £45million to spend on a left winger, with Grealish and Alejandro Garnacho in the frame. City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "12) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Alexander Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation and the fact that the Brazilian’s mate says he wants to live in London. Hide all the maps, lads.",

      "11) Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Liverpool\nApparently, Liverpool are looking to offer Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa to Napoli in exchange for the Nigeria striker. Which actually makes sense. We know Napoli like Nunez, who would either be a huge hit or a massive flop in Naples – there’s no middle ground. Swap deals don’t happen anymore – unless they a PSR tickle – but this could actually work, if there’s any truth in it.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. The Gunners are trying to keep their options open, which can only take them so far. Especially while Bayern Munich eye Sesko as a potential successor to Harry Kane.",
      "9) 🔼 Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",

      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, getting as far as they can with both before they have to make a decision either way. It’s a dangerous game, especially while both attract interest from elsewhere and players like to feel wanted. The Gunners will get no discount on either. Right now, there seems to be a little more noise around Sesko, but that could quickly change with the wind.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein said it’s done. But still we wait.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIt’s happening, apparently. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here. The fact Bournemouth have now signed a replacement suggests this will get moving again very soon.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical is scheduled for Monday, so we’re told.",

And he’d fit in perfectly as another old fogey in a defence that’s already home to Seamus Coleman, who turns 37 in October. Walker turned 35 in May, while Nathan Patterson, 12 years his junior, remains awfully injury-prone.",
      "The England right-back would have to take a pay-cut to join Everton, but his desire to stay in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad trumps money, amid reported interest from Fenerbahce. That ambition paid off in January when the Manchester City defender chose AC Milan over Saudi Arabia, and has been rewarded with a 100% call-up rate under the new England boss. The same logic could apply if Walker joins Everton and performs at a decent level.",
      "He’s desperate to reach 100 caps. And while Fenerbahce are hardly a nothing club that would ruin those hopes, proving he can still cut it in the Premier League (not the Turkish Super Lig) would be far more beneficial to that end.",

If recent rumours are anything to go by, Everton are showing real ambition ahead of their move from Goodison Park to the Hill Dickinson Stadium, with new owners the Friedkin Group keen to usher in a new era with better players.

      "Arne Slot is thought to be prioritising a more natural striker than a wide forward, but Rashford is capable of playing through the middle – more so than Cody Gakpo or Luis Diaz, anyway. And with the latter being targeted by Barcelona, a cut-price Rashford could be the ideal signing to maintain the depth that helped Liverpool cruise to the Premier League title.",

He’s still technically a Blues player but is certain to leave permanently this summer. Saudi Arabia feels extremely likely for the failed wonderkid, but the most plausible Premier League landing spot for him is Portugal C Wolves.",

They should feel confident going into a Europa League campaign with a manager who’s won the competition, and adding someone like Sancho would only add to that confidence.",
      "Sancho might think FA Cup winners Palace are beneath him, but we’re not so sure. He doesn’t have a future at Manchester United – even if Ruben Amorim hasn’t tried him out yet – and he flopped on loan at Chelsea, who paid £5m to send him back.",

Two title contenders rarely meet on the opening weekend. Some might argue there are exceptions – like Chelsea against Manchester City last year, or Roy Hodgson’s Liverpool against Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal – but if you genuinely believe those were title deciders in waiting, your head needs a wobble.",
      "We’ll admit the Emirates encounters between these two sides – even when United have been historically rubbish – have usually been fairly decent during Mikel Arteta’s reign. But the last two league matches in Manchester have been forgettable at best. The only thing Sky’s punditry team had to discuss at half- and full-time was the positioning of an Arsenal wall at a free-kick in March’s drab 1-1 draw.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the camp of a European striker after they ‘approached’ the Red Devils for a transfer.",
      "United struggled in front of goal in the Premier League last season. They were not far above scoring a single goal a game – 44 in 38 – and their strikers were very underwhelming.",
      "Between Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, despite the pair both playing more than 30 games, there were just seven goals scored.",
      "United know they need to rectify that, and after signing Matheus Cunha for the attack, they are still on the hunt for a No.9 to fully transform the forward areas.",
      "One might have fallen into their lap, as FootballTransfers reports the camp of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic – who has 56 goals in 142 games there – have ‘approached’ United directly.",
      "It’s said he is ‘increasingly pushing’ for a move to the club, with Old Trafford his ‘dream destination’. Indeed, Vlahovic is motivated by the idea of working under Ruben Amorim and playing in a more ‘open, physically demanding league’.",
      "United have held direct talks with the Serbian striker after the approach from his agent, as they ‘intensify efforts’ to land a ‘reliable’ No.9.",
      "The talks have been described as ‘positive and instructive’, which suggests it’s a move which could have legs.",
      "Vlahovic’s €45million (£38.5m) price tag is said to represent promising value for United.",
      "There might be some concern that their last two striker signings came from Italy, and have not had a great time of it at Old Trafford. Indeed, Hojlund had scored nine Serie A goals before his move, and Zirkzee 11.",
      "But Vlahovic’s best return in his Serie A career so far is 21 goals, and he’s passed 15 on three occasions.",
      "Every single season he has played at Juventus, the striker has scored at least 10 league goals, so there should be more confidence on the reliability of the 25-year-old than in the previously signed strikers.",
      "It is believed one of the main challenges will be Vlahovic’s salary. Juve are willing to get rid as the striker’s ‘lavish contract’ is proving a heavy burden now.",
      "He earns a reported €373,000 per week, which equates to around £319,000 per week, and Casemiro is the only player at United who earns over that.",

      "Omar Berrada: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course. We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it?\"",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",
      "Mbeumo can also create something from nothing. According to expected goals (xG), he scored nearly eight goals more than the quality of chances presented to him last season - more than any other player in the Premier League.",

      "Manchester United have entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, according to Sky Germany.",

      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Chelsea and Liverpool considered among the next landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers."
