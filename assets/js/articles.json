      "Sir Alex Ferguson's barbs were notorious for their sting and their ability to stick – just ask former Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince. Back in April 1998, ahead of a Premier League showdown with Liverpool, Sir Alex was dishing out his tactical wisdom.",
      "His focus sharpened on the Reds star and ex-United ace Ince, who had made the switch from Inter Milan the previous summer. Ferguson's voice rose, not quite to the decibel-shattering heights of his infamous hairdryer rants, but enough to command undivided attention.",
      "It was during this team talk, famously captured by cameras for the Granada documentary 'The Alex Ferguson Story', that he unleashed an iconic put-down of the ex-England international.",
      "\"If he tries to bully you he will f***ing enjoy it. Don't ever let him bully you. Right,\" bellowed the Scot, his words immortalised by the lens. \"You just make sure you are ready for him. That's all you need to worry about. He's a f***ing big-time Charlie.\"",
      "Those four words encapsulated Ferguson's disdain for oversized egos within the squad. By 2008, the legendary manager expressed regret over those remarks, labelling them a \"mistake\" and vowing to keep cameras away from his motivational speeches henceforth.",
      "\"But you've got to have some kind of big-time mindset to play for the biggest clubs in the world. In a way, he was right, but it's nothing that was ever going to affect me because I know how close we were.\"",
      "A decade on from Fergie putting his words out there for all to see, Ince was managing Blackburn Rovers against his old boss. Reflecting on the past remarks before the game, Ferguson said: \"I regret saying that. That was a mistake. We let a camera into our dressing room, which we had never done before, and it won't happen again. It wasn't a personality issue with Paul. With Paul you could not have a honeymoon all the time, because he was such a volatile character, but he never let us down.\"",
      "Revisiting the legendary manager's moment of remorse, an event rarely witnessed during or after his illustrious career, Ince said: \"Listen, people seem to have the impression that me and Sir Alex Ferguson never got on.",
      "\"I used to speak to him all the time and when I was managing Blackburn Rovers, I was on the phone to him all the time. When he said it, I was playing for Liverpool and, really, I think he was trying to wind up the likes of Roy Keane and say 'Oh Ince, he's just a big time Charlie' and all this type of stuff.",
      "\"Things like that didn't affect me. Maybe it would with players from today, but not Paul Ince back in my time. The fact that he regretted saying it was neither here nor there. The comment did not affect our friendship.\"",
      "Today, the ex-United manager and the former midfielder enjoy a bond that withstands the test of time and competition. That does not mean they have stopped competing against each other, though.",
      "\"I will always go to his house and play snooker, and kick his a***, and I will always pick my phone up to ring him,\" Ince added with a chuckle, highlighting the strong relationship that spans over three decades.",
      "Paul Ince was speaking on behalf of bet365, the official global partner of the UEFA Champions League. bet365 have given away more than 3000 UEFA Champions League tickets to fans this season, including the semi-finals and final. Full Terms and Conditions apply. Gamble Responsibly. Full interview can be found at bet365 News.",

      "Bruno Fernandes’ wish for former Manchester United team-mate Donny van de Beek has come true, with the Dutchman saying he “finally feels like a footballer again” after leaving the Red Devils.",
      "Van de Beek arrived at Old Trafford in 2020 from Ajax in a £35million deal when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge. But he failed to set Old Trafford alight under the Norwegian, gradually losing confidence and form to the point where he couldn’t even establish himself once his former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag took the reins.",
      "The midfielder made 62 appearances across his miserable four-year spell at the club, which also included unsuccessful loan moves to Everton and Eintracht Frankfurt as United sought to recover some of his transfer fee.",
      "The 28-year-old finally escaped his United nightmare by joining La Liga side Girona last summer in a deal worth a reported £420,000, which could rise to £7.6m.",
      "It made him United's first high-profile departure of the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era, after the arrivals of sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox.",
      "After Van de Beek confirmed his move to Girona, his former United captain Fernandes delivered a touching message on social media. Fernandes’ four-word message read: \"You deserve the best,\" along with a red heart.",
      "The Portuguese, who joined in January before Van de Beek’s arrival in the Premier League, will now be glad to know that Van de Beek is enjoying his football again in Spain. The former Netherlands international made 35 appearances for Girona this season, including seven in the Champions League, while scoring three goals and assisting two in all competitions.",
      "Van de Beek opened up about rediscovering his form in December, telling Voetbal International: \"My role was played out at Manchester United, so at the beginning of this year I wanted to make minutes elsewhere.",
      "\"The choice for Germany seemed nice, and don't get me wrong, Eintracht Frankfurt is really a big and beautiful club, but I really was lost around there. I was a loan player for a few months and then it is very simple: then you just have to deliver from the first game and impress. But I just couldn't.",
      "\"I got that far, needed rhythm and a series of games, only that was simply not possible. The result was that I was going to drive myself crazy. I had to show what I could do in a competition, which made me do way too much and I got away from myself.\"",
      "Turning his attention to Girona, he added: \"I enjoy it again. The fun, enjoying the game. That is so important and I have missed that feeling for so long. I finally feel like a footballer again.",
      "\"I think I've made more minutes this season than added up in the past four years. That says enough. The good feeling is back, I feel confidence again and the sacred fire in me has been fueled. Finally.\"",
      "Fernandes had appeared to be nearing his own move away from United in recent weeks. Following the crushing Europa League final defeat by Tottenham, speculation grew that the playmaker was open to leaving United if a big offer came in for him this summer.",
      "Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal were said to have held progressive talks with his representatives, while Red Devils bosses were reportedly willing to cash in on their skipper, who turns 31 this year.",
      "But it has since emerged that Fernandes rejected Al-Hilal’s lucrative offer after mulling things over with his wife. Explaining his decision, Fernandes said: “It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course.",
      "“Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "“It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, and I feel capable of it.”",

      "A Manchester United star was once banned for life for match fixing. After plying his trade with Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest, Enoch West made his way to the Red Devils in 1910.",
      "A prolific centre-forward, he racked up 72 goals in 166 appearances for United - but his heroic stint was marred with controversy after just five years. That's because in 1915, West and four of his team-mates, as well as three Liverpool players, were banned for life after being convicted of match-fixing.",
      "As many of those who received suspensions went off to fight for their country during the First World War, they saw them rescinded upon returning. However, West refused to adhere to the stipulation, and as a result, his ban stayed in place for 30 years before it was eventually lifted in 1945.",
      "The longest suspension in Football Association history, West never played professionally ever again, given he was 59 when his ban expired. And he is just one of a number of athletes who have been banned for one reason or another throughout their respective careers...",
      "Lou Vincent was handed a lifetime ban from playing cricket at any level, as well as entering any cricket ground or working in a professional coaching capacity in July 2014, after admitting to match-fixing offences. The New Zealand batter released an open letter which saw him admit to his \"dark secret\" which \"shamed\" not only himself, but also his country and the sport.",
      "After his suspension commenced, Vincent became a builder in Raglan. However, following a successful appeal in December 2023, his lifetime ban from domestic cricket was lifted, which allowed him to return to play and coach outside of the international game.",
      "One of the most famous cases of doping in sporting history, Lance Armstrong was handed a lifetime ban by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in 2012. As a result, the American - who won the Tour de France seven years in a row between 1999 and 2005 after recovering from testicular cancer - saw all of his major accomplishments on the roads and tracks of the world scrubbed from history.",
      "While Ben Johnson's rise to superstardom was unprecedented to say the least - breaking the 100-metre and 60-metre world records and winning a gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul - his downfall was equally as shocking. The Canadian sprinter tested positive for Stanozolol after the Olympics, while he admitted to having used steroids in the past.",
      "As a result, Johnson was later banned for two years and stripped of his Olympic medal for doping offences. Despite a brief comeback in 1991, he was once again found guilty of doping just two years later, and was banned for life by World Athletics.",
      "One of the country's most idolised stars, South African Test Cricket captain Hansie Cronje was handed a lifetime ban from the sport in 2000. Cronje, alongside Herschelle Gibbs, Nicky Boje and Pieter Strydom, was caught up in allegations of match-fixing, with the King Commission banning him from any involvement in cricket for life as a result.",
      "Despite challenging his ban the following year, his application was dismissed and he remained forbidden from competing in the sport.",
      "Liang Wenbo and Li Hang were among the snooker stars caught out in a widespread match-fixing ring in China, which rocked the sport in 2023. While eight others were suspended during the investigation, including 2025 World Snooker Champion Zhao Xintong, Liang and Li were deemed to have fixed matches, to have persuaded and encouraged others to fix matches, and to have bet on matches themselves.",
      "As a result, they each received lifetime bans. Zhao, meanwhile, was given a ban of one year and eight months, reduced from two-and-a-half years for early admissions of wrongdoing and his guilty plea. While the 28-year-old never rigged matches himself, he did accept charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on games himself.",

They are recruiting from a position of weakness, which makes their decisions even more important, amid the financial difficulties spelled out by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

Everyone in the squad is considered fair game, meaning there will be lots of incomings and outgoings this summer. Here are the latest pieces of news involving United.",
      "Manchester United have made one last attempt to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. An initial bid of £55m, comprised of £45m up front and £10m in add-ons, was rejected by the Bees, so United have upped their offer.",
      "They have now offered £55m plus £5m in add-ons for the Cameroon international, who banged in 20 Premier League goals last season. The offer appears to match Brentford's stated £60m valuation for Mbeumo.",
      "It would appear the final stumbling block in the move, given that the 25-year-old forward is keen to move to Old Trafford and has already agreed personal terms of around £200,000-a-week over a five-year contract with an option for an extra year.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has been linked with a move to Manchester United, due to his relationship with his old Sporting boss Amorim, and he has now ruled out on summer transfer. When asked about moving back to Sweden, the 27-year-old striker told Swedish Vogue: “After living in a warm country, it would be difficult.\"",
      "Gyokeres is understood to be available for £60m from Sporting this summer, but Arsenal are considered to be front-runners, because they can offer Champions League football.",

      "Cristian Chivu is poised to leave Parma to take over from Inzaghi and he will be given a say over a potential move for Hojlund. The Danish international has a good reputation in Serie A following his spell at Atalanta and could be offered a way out of Old Trafford.",
      "Inter will need new attackers, with Joaquin Correa and Marko Arnautovic set to depart. And Hojlund could fit the bill for Chivu, although there are suggestions he could prefer Parma star Ange-Yoan Bonny instead.",

A statement from the club says they have made what they believe 'is the right decision to give us the best chance of success going forward'.",
      "And in his own first words since the decision was announced, Postecoglou has reflected on the immense pride in leading Tottenham for exactly two years and his part in ending their trophy drought.",
      "“When I reflect on my time as Manager of Tottenham Hotspur my overriding emotion is one of pride,” Postecoglou said in a statement on social media.",
      "“The opportunity to lead one of England's historic football clubs and bring back the glory it deserves will live with me for a lifetime. Sharing that experience with all those who truly love this club and seeing the impact it had on them is something I will never forget.",
      "“That night in Bilbao was the culmination of two years of hard work. dedication and unwavering belief in a dream. There were many challenges to overcome and plenty of noise that comes with trying to accomplish what many said was not possible.",
      "“We have also laid foundations that mean this club should not have to wait 17 more years for their next success. I have enormous faith in this group of players and know there is much more potential and growth in them.”",
      "In a message to the supporters, he added: “I sincerely want to thank those who are the lifeblood of the club, the supporters. I know there were some difficult times but I always felt that they wanted me to succeed and that gave me all the motivation I needed to push on. It's important to acknowledge the hard working people at Spurs who gave me encouragement on a daily basis.",
      "“And finally, I want to thank those who were with me every day for the last two years. A fantastic group of young men who are now legends of this football club and the brilliant coaches who never once doubted we could do something special.",
      "“We are forever connected. Audere est Facere.”",
      "Spurs said in a statement: \"We are extremely grateful to Ange for his commitment and contribution during his two years at the club.",
      "\"Ange will always be remembered as only the third manager in our history to deliver a European trophy, alongside legendary figures Bill Nicholson and Keith Burkinshaw.",
      "\"However, the Board has unanimously concluded that it is in the best interests of the Club for a change to take place. Following a positive start in the 2023/24 Premier League (PL) season, we recorded 78 points from the last 66 PL games. This culminated in our worst-ever PL finish last season.",
      "\"At times there were extenuating circumstances - injuries and then a decision to prioritise our European campaign. Whilst winning the Europa League this season ranks as one of the Club’s greatest moments, we cannot base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph.\"",
      "It continued: It is crucial that we are able to compete on multiple fronts and believe a change of approach will give us the strongest chance for the coming season and beyond. This has been one of the toughest decisions we have had to make and is not a decision that we have taken lightly, nor one we have rushed to conclude.",
      "\"We have a talented, young squad and Ange has given us a great platform to build upon. We should like to express our gratitude to him. We wish him well for the future - he will always be welcome back at our home.\""

      "Former Manchester United star Nemanja Matic has been handed a four-match ban for covering up an anti-homophobia logo on his Lyon shirt. The midfielder joined the French side 18 months ago from Ligue 1 rivals Rennes.",
      "Matic has been a key player for Lyon, even captaining them on occasions. He was brought on as a late substitute in their final day triumph over Angers, which helped them secure qualification for the Europa League.",
      "The final day was Ligue 1's dedicated period to show support for the LGBT+ community. The games coincided with International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia on 17 May.",
      "Clubs put a rainbow patch on their shirt sleeves, as well as a symbol which had the word 'homophobia' in French crossed out with a red line and 'football' underneath. Matic appeared on the pitch with a piece of white material covering the rainbow logo.",
      "The 36-year-old was blasted for the move by France's sports minister Marie Barsacq, who said: “Football has a massive platform, and the (French Football) Federation is determined to put this issue on the clubs’ and supporters’ agenda.",
      "“Homophobic insults and behaviour are no longer acceptable. Society has evolved, and the language in football must change with it. There’s a full range of sanctions available, and they must be applied.”",
      "He was subsequently charged by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which governs French football. Their disciplinary committee have now confirmed the punishment, with Matic handing a two-match ban, with a further two matches suspended.",
      "He has also agreed to participate in an awareness-raising campaign on the fight against homophobia within six months. An LFP statement read: “After hearing the player, the Commission sanctioned him with a two-match suspension and a two-match suspended sentence.",
      "“Furthermore, the Commission offered the player—who immediately agreed during the hearing—to participate, within six months, in an awareness-raising campaign on the fight against homophobia in football, in collaboration with an expert association working alongside the LFP throughout the season with clubs and supporters.”",
      "Le Havre's Ahmed Hassan has been handed the same punishment after also covering up the rainbow logo on his shirt. Homophobia remains a huge problem in football, with Josh Cavallo, the first-ever top-flight star to come out, urging players to stand with LGBT+ people.",
      "“So it is quite hurtful. They don't realise how impactful that could be to the LGBT+ community. It breaks my heart every time I see something like that. It's not on. If you're a football player, you have certain responsibilities.",
      "“There's certain things you can or can't say on the pitch because you'll get sent off. There's things you can and can't do in the public right as a professional athlete. So doing that for me, is disgusting.",
      "“It's just saying you don't like associating yourself with a certain group or people, which for me is my life. So, I find it quite disgusting. Everyone wants to be your friend, everyone wants to be an ally, but when it comes to the times we to speak up together, or need support, that's when we count on our allies.”"

      "Manchester United's hopes of signing Viktor Gyokeres have been given a major boost after a key obstacle quietly disappeared. The club were thought to be outsiders in the race for Gyokeres' signature, with Arsenal leading the pack for some time.",
      "But it appears the Swedish goal machine is now open to joining the Red Devils, despite the fact that they won't be playing Champions League football next season. No formal talks have been held between United and Sporting CP, but a reunion with Ruben Amorim now looks a genuine possibility, particularly with Arsenal focusing on a deal to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Gyokeres was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford in January, despite Amorim promising not to raid his old club for talent during the winter window. The Portuguese coach was as good as his word, but made no such promise about the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres, who turned 27 on Wednesday, is reportedly available for around £60million - a fee significantly lower than the £85m release clause in his contract. Given that United spent £72m on Rasmus Hojlund in 2023, that asking price may feel like a bargain.",
      "However, agent fees and Gyokeres' wage demands will need to be taken into account as well. The striker has scored an astonishing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, and despite currently earning just £39,000 per week at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, he is expected to seek a salary exceeding £250,000 per week.",
      "Only five current United players earn weekly wages of £250,000 or more. Of those, three - Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Casemiro - are likely to leave this summer, while the remaining two - Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount - have also been linked with exits.",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe aiming to rein in spending amid ongoing PSR concerns, United may hesitate to meet Gyokeres' hefty demands. However, the chance to sign a striker of his calibre - especially with limited competition - could prove too tempting to ignore and a gamble worth taking.",
      "Top European sides such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City already have world-class centre forwards in place, while United's other Premier League rivals appear to be pursuing other options.",
      "Chelsea recently beat United to the signing of Ipswich striker Liam Delap, and although they remain in the market for another forward, Hugo Ekitike appears to be their primary target. Liverpool are reportedly eyeing the Eintracht Frankfurt star as well, potentially viewing him as a replacement for Darwin Nunez, who is expected to leave Anfield this summer.",
      "The Red Devils have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, and are looking to seal a similarly priced deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. However, with several departures anticipated across United's forward line this summer, there is room - both in the squad and on the wage bill - for further additions.",
      "Gyokeres could prove to be the ultimate statement signing - one capable of firing United back up the table following a truly dismal season. But as with so many things at Old Trafford these days, any move will require walking a financial tightrope. Whether it pays off or backfires, the consequences will be significant and unavoidable."

      "Now, the numbers have been crunched to find out which clubs are in trouble and which teams are able to spend big this summer. The calculations, via The Athletic, deal out a headline estimate of the amount each club can lose before tax to avoid a breach.",
      "The estimate draws from figures released for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 campaigns, with the most recent one completing each club’s three-year PSR cycle. We've ranked all 20 clubs in order from least likely to breach PSR to most likely.",
      "Playing with the most space in their accounts is Chelsea, who have used a series of loopholes to build up their profits. Intra-group sales of hotels, car parks and the club's women's team have allowed the Blues to create a mammoth-sized headroom with PSR.",
      "Chelsea's pre-tax results over the past two years show a profit of £38.3m. They have further alleviated any PSR concerns over the past 12 months, ensuring the Blues should be able to spend big this summer.",
      "Brighton also have a large amount of headroom to play with, having earned a huge pre-tax profit of £208.4m over the past two years. The Seagulls are insulated from PSR concerns by their Category 1 academy as well as depreciation costs.",
      "While they missed out on qualification for European competition (that may well change), it was a solid first season under Fabian Hürzeler. He should have a bumper transfer kitty to play with this summer.",
      "Manchester City may have splurged in the January window, but Pep Guardiola's side will still be able to spend bif this summer. City have accrued a profit of £154.1m over the past two years, before allowable costs are deducted.",
      "Any lost money from early exits from the Champions League and Carabao Cup will likely be offset by this summer's Club World Cup. They are in a very healthy situation when it comes to PSR.",
      "While they have lost £120.7m over the past two years, Tottenham's stadium has allowed them to move into the black when it comes to PSR. They should be able to account for a near-£70m in depreciation costs.",
      "That means Spurs should be able to lose well over £250m in this accounting year and remain compliant. Winning the Europa League will add to the kitty, along with the incoming Champions League prize money.",
      "This is where things start to get slightly confusing. While Manchester United plc have lost a massive amount of money over recent year's, the club's PSR position is actually calculated as the accounts of Red Football Limited, a subsidiary of the plc.",
      "RFL bear none of the costs from Sir Jim Ratcliffe's share purchase and benefit from booking interest income on intra-group loans owed to RFL by entities further up the chain. It means that United's big-spending summer is likely to continue, without any PSR concerns.",
      "Arsenal's pre-tax loss is calculated at £34.6m for the past two seasons, before any more allowable costs on youth development, community expenditure and spending on the women’s team. That should hand them significant headroom.",
      "The sales of academy graduates Emile Smith Rowe and Eddie Nketiah last summer also helped. And reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League saw the Gunners bank £100m in prize money.",

      "While they had points deducted in the 2023/2024 campaign for PSR breaches, those concerns have now been eased. Their seventh-place finish in the Premier League this season has generated £34.2m in prize money.",
      "That adds to a £10.1m profit last season, having recorded more than £100m in player sales. That swung an operating loss back into the black and the prize money earned this season should allay any PSR concerns.",

      "It is estimated that the Londoners can lose up to £77m this year and remain compliant. They have been able to utilise greater prize money, higher sale profits and the benefit of premium matchday ticketing.",

The sales of Georginio Rutter, Crysencio Summerville and Glen Kamara brought in around £70m with Rasmus Kristensen's move to Eintracht Frankfurt boosting that number.",
      "The Whites may well come close to the limit, but they should be able to avoid having to sell players before the end of June. Winning the Championship title means they should escape any PSR breach.",
      "Everton have long had trouble with complying with PSR, culminating in a points deduction. The sale of the club to The Friedkin Group has slightly eased concerns, but they have posted losses of £142.3m over the last two years.",
      "They can only lose £39m in this accounting period to avoid breaching PSR. Prize money only ticked up a small amount and last summer's big sales have not helped much. More pain could be coming for the Toffees.",
      "Bournemouth's major spending in the transfer market was only possible through a £71.4m loan being written off in their PSR calcuation. That allowed them to post a £44.5m profit in 2022/2023.",
      "The club's allowable costs are very low as well, putting them in a difficult place. But the sale of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid should help them ease their concerns, as well as increased Premier League prize money.",
      "Sunderland's eight years outside the Premier League means they’re the only club who won’t have the opportunity to benefit from at least one PSR year with an upper loss limit of £35million; instead, each of the three years within their PSR calculation are capped at an upper limit of £13m, or £39m in total.",
      "Having received no equity in recent years, their limit is actually just £15m. The Black Cats can make several deductions and made several major sales last summer, which means they should be ok, despite the estimations looking tight.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League is set to seriously cost Aston Villa when it comes to PSR. They will instead only be able to call upon the Europa League's much smaller prize pot.",
      "Villa have made several major sales in recent transfer windows and it looks likely they will have to do the same this summer, with Emi Martinez currently the man earmarked for being moved on.",
      "Burnley are in a miserable position. They are the only club who require a profit in this financial year to avoid breaching PSR and with it a potential points deduction.",
      "They have recorded a loss of £64.4m over the past two years and their recent bouncing between the top-flight and the Championship means they can record a loss of £61m over this three-year period."

      "Bruno Fernandes has been praised by former Manchester United star Ben Foster for snubbing a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia. The United skipper disclosed this week that he had rejected the chance to exit Old Trafford for Al-Hilal.",
      "The decision came despite the Saudi Pro League club's willingness to fork out an eye-watering £300million package, which included £100m for United and a £200m contract for the Portuguese midfielder. The 30-year-old playmaker turned down the offer after stating his desire to maintain his career \"at the highest level\".",
      "Ex-United goalkeeper Ben Foster has now voiced his joy at Fernandes' decision to stay put, despite questioning his sanity with a tongue-in-cheek remark.",
      "Sharing his thoughts via his Cycling GK Instagram account, the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper said: \"I'm so happy about it, because it just goes to show that some footballers actually do it for the love of the game - it's not all about money.\"",
      "\"Not only that, we want to see the best players playing in the Premier League week in, week out, and Bruno Fernandes is one of those players.\"",
      "Speaking directly to Fernandes, Foster said: \"Bruno, I don't know whether you're a little bit mad or just madly in love with football, either way, I love it, mate. I'm all over it and looking forward to watching you playing in the Premier League next season.\"",
      "Fernandes revealed at a press conference on Tuesday why he turned down a move to Al-Hilal as United plan for a rebuild under manager Ruben Amorim. Speaking while on international duty with Portugal, he said: \"There was an opportunity. The [Al-Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there.",
      "\"They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go. Manchester United didn't want to sell me. They don't need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.",
      "\"It [would have been] an easy move, even at a family level. I had João Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team. We have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions and I feel capable of it.\"",
      "After a disappointing season which saw United finish 15th in the Premier League, Amorim, who succeeded Erik Ten Hag last November, is aiming to revamp his squad. The club has already made one major signing after bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, while interest has also been shown in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "\"To turn that money down at a point where Manchester United are at their lowest ebb and say, 'No, I want to fight through this, I want to see it through the other side, I want to come out and achieve things', I think it says a lot about him as a person, as a character. The club needs people who are going to run through a brick wall for them.\"",

      "The Cameroon international enjoyed a fantastic season with the Bees and scored 20 Premier League goals in a formidable partnership with Wissa, who bagged 19 strikes. And that now appears to have earned Mbeumo a move away from the club.",
      "Manchester United are said to be confident of securing the former Troyes star's signature this summer, and are prepared to stump up a salary that would see Mbeumo earn five times his current wage of £50k-a-week. Brentford have turned down an opening offer of £45million plus a further £10m in bonuses, and are holding out for a £60m package.",
      "United are looking for more firepower having scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last term, and have already added Matheus Cunha to their ranks from Wolves. The Red Devils are set to beat the likes of Newcastle to Mbeumo's signature after the forward indicated his willingness to move to Old Trafford.",
      "And Mbeumo's next club have been given an indication of his temperament before completing a deal. The 25-year-old admitted he can be fiery and that Wissa has helped him manage that.",
      "\"He helped me a lot with the mental part,\" Mbeumo told BBC Sport Africa. \"I get angry really easy. He [Wissa] helped me to just stay cool.\"",
      "Mbeumo, who describes himself as an 'electrical player', has perhaps shown United chiefs he is able to show leadership off the pitch in addition to his talents on it however. The forward took Wissa under his wing upon the latter's arrival at Brentford in 2021.",
      "Wissa, 28, moved outside of France for the first time when he moved from Lorient. Mbeumo was keen to extend his experience to his team-mate having been afforded the same kindness by Julian Jeanvier and Said Benrahma, who helped him settle in.",
      "\"I learned a lot from [former Brentford players] Julian Jeanvier and Said Benrahma who helped me before so I wanted to do the same with him because I think it is hard when you leave your first place and go to another country.",

      "Manchester United will get a glimpse at their goalkeeping past this summer, with David de Gea poised to return to Old Trafford. United have struggled to replace De Gea since he left two years ago, after he spent 12 years between the posts for the club, and his return could serve to highlight their inadequacy in the position.",
      "Erik ten Hag chose to release De Gea and sign Andre Onana for £47million in the summer of 2023 as the Spaniard’s replacement. It was a big call by the former United boss, who worked with Onana at Ajax and was convinced he was the right player to fill De Gea’s boots.",
      "The Spaniard made 545 appearances for United, spending a decade as the club’s first-choice goalkeeper and winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Europa League and two Carabao Cups. He went through ups and downs during his time as United’s No.1 but Onana’s struggles in the past few seasons have strengthened his legacy.",
      "Now 34, De Gea is playing for Fiorentina, where he has made a brilliant start with the Italian side and earned rave reviews, helping them finish sixth in Serie A while reaching the semi-finals of the Conference League. Many United fans have noted his performances with jealousy – and they will soon get to see their former star in person.",
      "Having embarked on an ill-fated post-season tour to Malaysia and Hong Kong, United will soon be playing pre-season matches. They begin their pre-season against Leeds in Stockholm on July 19 before flying over to the Untied States for games against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side will then return to Old Trafford to play Fiorentina on August 9 before the Premier League begins again on August 16. That match against Fiorentina will see De Gea return to his old stomping ground, where he is sure to get a warm reception from United supporters.",
      "Who will be in goal for United that day remains unclear, with the club being urged to move on from Onana. The club have been linked with Aston Villa star Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain’s Gianluigi Donnarumma following another patchy campaign from Onana.",
      "The Cameroon international kept just nine clean sheets in 34 Premier League games as United came 15th. Amorim dropped him for Altay Bayindir after two shocking errors in the 2-2 draw against Lyon in April and his future is therefore uncertain.",
      "However, it seems Onana could survive the cull this summer, simply because United have bigger fish to fry. The club have already agreed to shell out £62.5m to sign Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and have also offered £50m to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "While United are open to offers for any of their players, upgrading in goal is not considered to be as important as other positions. United are still hopeful that former Inter Milan and Ajax star Onana can rediscover his best form while they focus their spending power elsewhere.",

      "Manchester United should take a brutal approach with Andre Onana and not hesitate to replace him in the summer transfer window. That’s the opinion of former United goalkeeper Ben Foster, who believes that a much better player could be available from a Premier League rival this summer.",
      "Onana has failed to live up to his billing since joining United in a £47million transfer from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023. The Cameroon international was signed by Erik ten Hag, who worked with him at Ajax, but his two-season stint at the club has been defined by high-profile blunders.",
      "He was one of many players to underperform during United’s dreadful 2024/25 campaign, keeping just nine clean sheets in 34 Premier League appearances as they finished 15th. Ruben Amorim dropped him for Altay Bayindir after two shocking errors in the 2-2 draw against Lyon in April and Onana faces an uncertain future.",
      "United reportedly considered a move for Aston Villa star Emi Martinez in January before sticking with Onana. But they have remained in touch with the Argentina goalkeeper and could move for him this summer, with Villa perhaps needing to sell to meet profit and sustainability rules after missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "That would be a wise decision, according to Foster, who told talkSPORT: “It's a brutal league, the Premier League, and I kind of think [over] the last two seasons that he hasn't done enough to prove that he is a Manchester United number one.",
      "“I think he's got ability, and like so many other Man United players, he'd go elsewhere and probably flourish. I think that's probably going to be the case with him as well. If the opportunity does come to sign somebody like Emi Martinez, they've got to go for it. He's still one of the best goalkeepers in the world.",
      "“A lot of people said this season, probably not up to the standard of the previous two years, but still one of the best goalkeepers in the world.",
      "“You've got to have a strong spine in any football team. If you get the goalie right, you get a couple of strikers in, Bruno's going to be staying now. It's a great start to the transfer window for them.”",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down a gigantic contract at Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal to stay put at Old Trafford. But several other players are set to leave in the summer transfer window, with Amorim clear that an overhaul is needed to turn things around.",

United have made a positive start to the window by lining up a £62.5m deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and are also trying to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Dutch coach Meulensteen also said Ajax could not believe United paid £80million for Antony and were “doing cartwheels” when the fee was agreed.",
      "United are looking to get rid of Antony and Garnacho this summer, to raise funds to allow Amorim to rebuild his under-performing squad. Other players will also be moved on in a major summer revamp, but Meulensteen said United must start with their two wasteful wingers.",
      "“I wouldn't bring Antony back because I've seen enough of him that he's not cut out for the club and not good enough,” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips. \"His performances are fuelled by his personality and are not for the good of the team, he’s selfish.",
      "“You will never get your £80m back from Antony. I thought it was stupid business at the time when I heard it was happening. I know that when they heard about the deal in Amsterdam, they were doing cartwheels. It shows again that players in those lower leagues, like Holland, are completely different.",
      "“They're playing very different styles, a slower tempo. Teams like Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are the best, so it's easy for them to look good. But coming into the Premier League is so much different. What is Antony’s return? How many goals and assists has he got? He's probably got as many, if not more, in Spain than in England, that different kind of football is more ideal for him.”",
      "Meulensteenalso laid into Garnacho, who was told by Amorim to find a new club after the sulky winger hit out at his boss after being dropped for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "“Garnacho is the same as Antony,” said Meulensteen. “Yes, he’s a young boy but, personality-wise, some things are not right with him and he's bad for the club. That shows in his performances and lack of consistency.",
      "“He’s a young player who has good value to him, so if they were to get offered any sort of money, they should cut their losses, because he isn’t going to live up to his potential at Old Trafford and that can free up some money to spend elsewhere.”",
      "Meulensteenalso called on Amorim to replace error-prone goalkeeper Andre Onana this summer. “It’s vital they look to replace Onana,” he said. “If you look at United's history, they started building a successful team through the goalkeeper, with Peter Schmeichel, Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea. They must bring confidence to the defence as that galvanises the whole back line.",
      "“There are some major frailties and plenty of mistakes. If there's a better goalkeeper available, they should take them. Having a really good goalkeeper lays the foundations and is massively important.”",

Defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in Bilbao had fans fearing a bargain basement window, so the intent shown in trying to put together deals totalling £120million in the first week of business is encouraging.",
      "Missing out on European football left a £100million blackhole in the club's budget for next season, but their position with regards to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) is better than expected, as shown by the desire to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo before the June 30 cut-off for the latest accounts to be submitted.",
      "That date acted as a second transfer deadline last summer, with clubs close to a breach desperately trying to sell academy graduates to ease concerns about a points deduction. Newcastle, Aston Villa, Chelsea, and Everton all cashed in, often trading with each other.",
      "United won't need to be part of that murky merry-go-round this month. Instead, the focus is on spending and the financial results posted on Friday for the first three months of 2025 hinted at an improving picture.",
      "Revenues were up, costs were down, and the situation looked an awful lot rosier than Sir Jim Ratcliffe had made it sound back in March, when he told people the club was going to run out of money by the end of the year.",
      "The club's financial crisis has been boosted by the 25% reduction in wages amongst the first-team squad for failing to qualify for the Champions League, which will carry over into next season. Savings are also being realised on the 250 or so staff made redundant last year, with a further 200 losing their jobs this year.",
      "That offers a better financial outlook at Old Trafford, but club bosses are still preaching caution. They talk of \"disciplined\" spending in this window and a desire to ensure costs continue to fall, building a stronger foundation for the club's long-term financial health.",
      "There are a couple of other factors at play in this window, and they are linked. Firstly, as Ratcliffe confirmed in that round of interviews in March, United will spend around £89million in transfer fee instalments this window, naming Andre Onana, Casemiro, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund as players who would cost money this summer, with fees still due to their former clubs.",
      "That kind of credit card dealing isn't unusual now, but United have taken it to extremes, with more than £300million owed on players they have 'signed' in recent windows. They took the same approach in the deal for Cunha, splitting his £62.5million release clause over three instalments.",
      "They are likely to continue to pursue that approach, given that cash reserves are one area where the business is continuing to struggle. Any sales might boost that figure, but the March 31 accounts showed cash available was down to £73.2million, a fall of £22.5million in those three months.",
      "While there is a revolving credit facility United can call on, as of March 31, it had an outstanding balance of £210million and a limit of £300million, so it doesn't add much to the pile.",
      "That's why this window promises to be a fascinating one for United. In theory, their financial position is better than expected, and sales can boost the funds available to them. But they are also constrained about how much cash they can actually spend.",
      "So, as the club pushes ahead with plans to revamp Amorim's squad, expect more negotiations in which the focus isn't necessarily on the fee but on its structure and how long United will have to pay it off."

      "Manchester United have wasted no time in trying to make their mark on this summer's transfer window.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last Sunday, United are now attempting to secure the signature of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After discovering the Cameroonian is keen on a move to Old Trafford, United tabled an opening offer for the 25-year-old in midweek, understood to be worth £55million, but it was rejected. However, they are understood to remain in talks with the Bees and a revised offer is expected.",
      "Having signed Cunha for £62.5m, Brentford are expected to demand a similar fee for their talisman, who plundered 20 Premier League goals this season. He is an established top flight operator and United want to sign players who can come in and hit the ground running.",
      "It is understood United have recruited Cunha, 26, to operate in the left-sided No.10 position, meaning Mbeumo is being targeted with the expectation of operating from the right-sided No.10 position. United also remain determined to sign a striker to operate down the middle.",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's appointment last November, United immediately transitioned to a 3-4-2-1 system, meaning the two roles previously reserved for the wingers are now occupied by attacking-midfielders.",
      "As a result of United's plan to cut their cloth this summer, the sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who are all natural wingers, have been prioritised. Fellow winger Alejandro Garnacho has also been informed he can leave.",
      "The only winger who does have a future at United is Amad. He quickly got to grips with the responsibility of being a wing-back and flexed his muscles as a No.10, meaning he has a key part to play in Amorim's plans.",
      "But with United now attempting to add Mbeumo to their pool of attackers, the expectation is that Amad's long-term position could be at right wing-back. Mbeumo, however, is also capable of playing up front, meaning that could open up a window of opportunity for Amad to start in a more advanced role.",
      "Cunha, however, is a specialist No.10. That means Bruno Fernandes looks increasingly likely to be tasked with pulling the strings from the centre of midfield.",
      "But while he and Amad have alternative roles they may find themselves occupying in Amorim's first-choice XI, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount do not necessarily have that same guarantee.",
      "Mainoo has struggled to nail down a place in the team this calendar year, regularly finding himself flittering between the centre of midfield and either of the two No.10 positions. His profile as a forward-thinking midfielder means the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield risks leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Injuries hindered Mainoo's chances of settling into any form of rhythm under Amorim, meaning many believe he has not yet had a fair opportunity to flex his muscles in a 3-4-2-1 system. Many believed Amorim's appointment would mark the beginning of a long-term midfield partnership with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "However, Cunha's arrival means Fernandes is almost certainly going to occupy one of the two No.8 positions. Ideally, he needs a defensive-minded operator next to him to allow him to play his natural game and advance into attacking positions.",
      "It means Mainoo is not guaranteed a regular starting berth next season, likewise Mount. Despite being signed from Chelsea two years ago to operate in a three-man midfield, he is much more effective in Amorim's system when occupying one of the two No.10 roles.",
      "He started the final four games of this season, including the Europa League final, as the left-sided No.10, highlighting where Amorim sees his long-term future. However, Cunha's arrival and the possibility of Mbeumo being added to the equation means he may not be a regular starter come August.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is another member of the current squad who is at his best when playing as a No.10. After failing to make his mark as a No.9, his performances improved once he was tasked with operating slightly deeper and linking the midfield with the attack.",
      "With all of that mind, United could find themselves with Cunha, Mbeumo, Fernandes, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee and Amad all pushing for starts in either of the two No.10 positions.",
      "Seven into two, of course, doesn't go, meaning Amorim and the United hierarchy may have to make some tough decisions. Only Fernandes and Amad have alternative roles where they could realistically remain guaranteed starters."

      "Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 top flight goals between them last season and seem natural fits for the two number 10 positions in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 shape. The United chief made it clear last season that he wouldn't be switching systems and this summer offers the Reds a chance to recruit to suit.",
      "The arrival of Cunha and Mbeumo will have a knock on effect elsewhere in the squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes could retreat to a central midfielder rather than operating in an advanced role. The Portugal international increasingly played in the deeper midfield role as the season progressed and has the capabilities to be a success in a dictating role.",
      "Amad would also seemingly lose his spot as a number 10 despite an impressive campaign last term. But the Ivory Coast international is capable of playing as a right wing back in Amorim's system while slotting in further forward should the need arise.",
      "The 22-year-old has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "Diogo Dalot would be the natural competition for Amad and if the latter does amend his position then it frees Noussair Mazraoui up to be a centre back option. The 27-year-old played a number of positions during his debut campaign at Old Trafford but he does not offer the attacking input needed for a wing back role and slotting in as one of the back three would make the most sense.",
      "United are unlikely to cap their business at the arrival of Cunha and Mbeumo with a striker also on the shortlist. A move for Liam Delap failed after the 22-year-old opted to choose Chelsea but the Reds are likely to explore alternatives in the summer, albeit they will likely need to sell before they strengthen further.",
      "The addition of a centre forward would be bad news for Rasmus Hojlund, who struggled in his second campaign at United. The Dane, who is attracting interest from Inter Milan, had shown promise and potential in his debut season but regressed amid the pressure of leading the line.",
      "Still only 22, Hojlund could benefit from a more reduced role next term while offering industry and energy off the bench. He could become something of an impact player, called upon when attacking resources are required to offer another forward option. It's not what Hojlund will want, but it might be just what he needs."

      "These were the poster boys of a new era, a trio to build around. Come August it's feasible that none of them are Manchester United players.",
      "Garnacho is on his way out. Ruben Amorim has made up his mind and the talented but once too often petulant forward will be sold this summer provided a decent offer arrives.",
      "Hojlund is attracting interest from Inter Milan after a difficult second season at United where his form and confidence dipped. The Reds are seeking a new striker this summer and if he stays at Old Trafford, the Dane will be down the pecking order.",
      "Mainoo too, is far from certain to stay at his boyhood club. He is the most likely to still be a Red when the transfer window closes but an injury hit campaign last term coupled with a seeming lack of faith from Amorim and the stalling of contract talks means the 20-year-old could be sold.",
      "He was starring in Euro 2024 a year ago after a breakthrough campaign with United that ended with him scoring in an FA Cup final win over Manchester City. Garnacho too was on target that day. If both are sold it would represent pure profit from an accounting point of view as both came through the academy. The Profit and Sustainability Regulations certainly play a part here.",
      "United are under financial pressure and are already opening their chequebook this summer. Balance will be needed.",
      "Since that day 16 months ago when Hojlund, Mainoo and Garnacho sat arm in arm soaking up the adulation of United fans the picture at the club has changed. It's not the only picture that looks different now."

      "In this case, it means if Elanga were to be sold for £50m, which is not beyond the realms of possibility, as he has three years remaining on his current deal, then United would be entitled to a slice of the roughly £30m.",
      "It might only prove to be a minuscule fee, somewhere in the region of £3m-£6m, but as Ruben Amorim looks set to overhaul the side that so desperately underachieved this season, every penny will count.",

      "Littleton Road has been the birth place of many Manchester United careers and dreams over the years.",
      "The Salford site has played host to the likes of Eric Cantona, David Beckham and many other famous faces, meaning every youngster that now graces the pitches at the United training academy has a story to aspire to try and replicate.",
      "Last month, the venue played host to the Manchester Youth Super League's Champions Cup finals with the pitches flooded with youngsters looking to clinch some end-of-season silverware.",
      "Among the teams involved on the evening of Monday, May 12, were Partington & Carrington FC, who were formed by Freedom Football only last year to have a localised club to serve children who were previously choosing to go to clubs in Urmston and Altrincham.",
      "Partington & Carrington had two teams in attendance at Littleton Road - Under-8s Argyle and Under-8s Wanderers - and it was the latter that found itself going up against one of United head coach Ruben Amorim's two sons.",
      "Wanderers were in a final against Alderley United and Amorim turned up to watch his son and the rest of the action unfold. Arriving 15 minutes before kick-off at 7pm, Amorim was soon spotted by Partington & Carrington chairman and coach Matthew Sollitt, 36, who approached the United head coach to see if he would agree to a post-match photograph with his team.",
      "\"Basically, to set the scene, kick-off was at 7pm and we got there at 4.15pm [overseeing other games] and he probably came about 6.45pm. He had a bright white T-shirt on, his handsome haircut and his shades on.",
      "\"He came strolling across with his wife and kids and we had a team that had just been beaten in the final previously and all the kids that had played in that saw him on the way out. They had just been beaten on penalties and Amorim stopped for every kid. I only found that out afterwards.",
      "\"And then as he came over, I spoke to their coach, Jack, who is a top man at Alderley United, and I said to him, 'Jack, do you want to sort a photo out for afterwards, win or lose?' and he was like, 'Yes, ask him'.",
      "\"So I went up to him and said, 'Ruben, I'm sorry to bother you, but can I arrange a photo with our team for after the game?' He said it was no problem.\"",
      "For Sollitt and his team, it turned out they would pose for the post-match photograph in victorious circumstances. They beat Alderley United 2-0 to clinch the trophy and Amorim was only too happy to fulfil the pre-match agreement.",
      "\"We played the game and ended up beating them 2-0,\" Sollitt continued. \"It was a game that felt like it needed a mistake or maybe a worldie, and one of our kids found the top corner from about 15, 20 yards out. We went on to win 2-0 after that.",
      "\"Amorim went on the balcony after the game, we all got our medals and trophies and we went through a back door and down the stairs. But before I had even had a conversation with him, he had already planned with the league organisers to take a photo with all the teams. They all clapped him and started singing about United and the Amorim song.",
      "\"Even talking about it now, both as a United fan and being chairman of a football club, it's absolutely unbelievable. What an experience.\"",
      "With Amorim and fellow United representatives in attendance, Partington & Carrington's youngsters could have easily been distracted by the high-profile observers. However, they were motivated by the desire to get the better of Amorim's son's team.",
      "Explaining how the youngsters felt pre-match after catching a glimpse of Amorim, Sollitt said: \"To be honest, I think they were just more bothered about beating his son for the sake of it! They didn't say those words, but it wasn't like, 'I want to showcase my talent in front of Amorim'. it was we want to beat his son.",
      "\"I thought that was quite a good mentality because we are not a win at all-costs team. The only time we really want to win is maybe in a final or a tournament. We are nine-month season and for eight-and-a-half of those we spend the time developing, changing the kids' positions, making sure they learn the game and be a good child, basically. That is our aim.",
      "\"But when we get to a final, we want to win it. The kids were really calm but very excited after seeing him. Once we told them that we were going to get a photo afterwards, I think they calmed down.\"",
      "When the opportunity came to get up close and personal to the United chief, however, Sollitt's players were in awe of the 40-year-old.",
      "\"They had pens and all sorts,\" he explained. \"I just told them to get a photo with him, say thank you, have a quick chat and give him a high-five. That was where everyone else saw him doing it with us, but he had already agreed to it.",
      "\"He then high-fived literally every kid. A lot of our parents stayed behind as well to watch. I stayed behind for a little bit.",
      "\"And the fact he was at one of Manchester United's training academies as well, a place full of history, where a lot of superstar footballers and famous people have played and grown up there, for our kids to go and play there and get a photo with the current manager, it doesn't get much better than that.\"",
      "Although the Under-8s Wanderers side were victorious at Littleton Road, the Under-8s Argyle were beaten on penalties. But Amorim's presence and interaction with them soon meant their spirits were lifted.",
      "Explaining how the youngsters reacted to engaging with the United boss, who had overseen a 2-0 loss to West Ham United at Old Trafford just 24 hours earlier, Sollitt recalled: \"They were just in awe of him. I have to reiterate that our team, the hour before, lost on penalties and we must have had three or four kids crying.",
      "\"They had finished top of their league and they ended up getting beat in the final. Because they saw Amorim, it was all forgotten. I got messages in our parents' chat and they were all posting: 'Oh my God, we've just met Amorim!'",
      "\"I didn't see this until after the 7pm game, so I was non the wiser, other than that I had an inkling that he was coming to watch his son play. They were just in awe of him, and the fact the previous team had got beat and then this made their day, it is just a memory.",
      "\"I have got a smile on my face talking about it now. Even when I put the photo into all our other teams, there were non-Manchester United fans who were like, 'Wow, that's brilliant'. I think most fans look at coaches as a coach; they don't look at them as a person. I was guilty of that in my younger days.",
      "\"But now that I am older and I am a coach, I am not as biased as a Manchester United fan. It was really good to see that he was there, just as a good person.",
      "\"He didn't have to stay. I know some might say he had to because everyone else was there. His son had just lost 2-0 in a really good, competitive game that was played fairly and we scored a really good goal.\"",
      "Sollitt founded Freedom Football in 2022 with the ambition of creating a different culture and approach in comparison to other football clubs at grassroots level. Alongside his business partner, Adam Cree, he is motivated to oversee an environment where children can develop their football skills without the pressure of having to win at all costs.",
      "“Freedom Football is our business,\" he explained. \"All our coaches are paid, we're not volunteers.",
      "\"Basically, we charge £35 a month - an extra £10 in comparison to your typical grassroots club - but there are no volunteers, no mums and dads who put their kids up top every week. We existed to remove those politics of your typical grassroots clubs and teams.",
      "\"Freedom Football is the name. I set it up three years ago. I just wanted to let the kids play; we don't shout and scream at them. We play to develop; we don't play to win at all costs.",
      "\"Then we set up the Partington & Carrington Football Club last year to just give us a better identity, more location and also receive some help from Trafford Council and Trafford Leisure. We are able to get Partington Sports Village now, which was a brand-new £1million pitch that was built by the football foundation.",
      "\"We have really grown since then and been able to give more accessible and better opportunities for the kids in the area. Before we set that up, people were leaving Partington & Carrington to go to clubs in Urmston and Altrincham. But now they are staying where they live and where they are from and play with us.\""

      "They missed out on the Serie A title by just one point and then lost 5-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final the following weekend.",

      "Manchester United have just a few days remaining to complete transfer business before the first mini transfer window of the summer closes. After opening at the start of the month, the window will close for a few days on Tuesday, 10 June.",
      "It will re-open six days later, allowing clubs to continue with their business until the deadline on September 1 (7pm). For United, they will hope to get their second signing of the summer over the line.",
      "The club are working hard on a potential deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. If he completes a move he will join Matheus Cunha at Old Trafford with the Brazilian completing a £62.5 million move from Wolves.",
      "Mbeumo has impressed in the Premier League with the Bees, the season just gone saw him score 20 goals in 38 league appearances. He also provided eight asists.",
      "As United work on completing a deal, here’s the latest news on the potential transfer.",
      "United have submitted their second offer for the forward, with reports claiming it could be their final offer to Brentford. After seeing their initial bid of £45 million plus £10 million in add-ons rejected, United have now upped their offer.",
      "The Mirror reports that the second offer is £55 million, plus £5 million in bonuses. It is still to be seen if Brentford will accept or reject the bid, with the Bees’ valuation of the player starting at £60 million.",
      "The report also says that personal terms over a five-year deal with wages around £200,000 per-week has already been agreed with the player.",
      "United may be keeping a close eye on what is going on at Tottenham Hotspur over the next few days, with it potentially impacting the transfer of Mbeumo.",
      "Spurs announced on Friday that they had parted ways with head coach Ange Postecoglou. Brentford boss Thomas Frank has quickly been instilled as favourite to take over.",
      "The uncertainty at Brentford may cause them to delay a decision over Mbeumbo, and any compensation that they potentially get for Frank could mean they rise the price for Mbeumo.",
      "There is then, of course, the threat that Frank makes a move of his own for the player if he is appointed at Tottenham. Spurs will be playing Champions League football next season after their Europa League win, and the player and manager know each other well.",
      "It’s a situation that will be watched very closely.",
      "It has been claimed that Mbeumo has told United in talks with the club that he wants £250,000 per week if he joins the club this summer.",
      "According to the Times, the Brentford man currently earns £50,000 per week at the Gtech Community Stadium, but wants that to increase fivefold upon any move to Old Trafford. If United agree then he would immediately become one of the club’s top earners."

      "Having completed the £62.5 million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, United are also working on completing a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The club are reported to have put a second bid on the table worth up to £60 million.",
      "But he’s not the only player to be heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer. Another name who keeps being mentioned is Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The Sweden international has caught the eye with his impressive goalscoring exploits since arriving in Portugal from Coventry. Amorim is reportedly eying a reunion with his former striker.",
      "Gyokeres has an £85 million release clause in his contract, although Sporting are willing to take a fee of around £60 million for the player this summer. United though, are not the only club interested, with Arsenal also heavily linked with the forward.",
      "Here’s a look at the latest reports surrounding the 27-year-old.",
      "The club are ‘ready’ to beat Arsenal to the signing of Gyokeres, according to the Sun. The report points to the dip in United’s expenses shown in their latest quarterly results, meaning that they are ready to make a move for the striker.",
      "Ruben Amorim is said to be keen to raid his former club and beat Arsenal to the signing, while the Gunners work on a deal for Red Bull Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Our collegues at the Mirror however report that the striker will pick a move to Arsenal, should he get a choice of the two clubs this summer. The opportunity to play Champions League football is outlined as one of the reasons.",
      "United’s poor season in the Premier League, and loss in the Europa League final against Tottenham means that’s something they can’t provide next season.",
      "It was announced earlier in the week that Gyokeres would not be taking part in either of Sweden’s two matches over the current international break due to a minor injury. Sweden took on Hungary in Budapest on Friday night, with goals from Benjamin Nygren and Yasin Ayari giving then a 2-0 win.",
      "On Tuesday they host Algeria, but will again be without Gyokeres. He left the camp with what was described as a minor injury."

      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last weekend, Manchester United are a third of the way towards to fixing their attack.",
      "United identified Cunha as one of their top targets for this summer's transfer window several months ago and acted swiftly to secure his signature on the opening day of the window, after triggering his £62.5million release clause.",
      "The Brazilian is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system after regularly making things happen from that area of the pitch at Molineux.",
      "However, United are maintaining discussions with Brentford and there is a growing belief they will be able to extract him from the Gtech Community Stadium amid the Cameroonian's desire to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Should United secure the 25-year-old's signature, they will sign him on the back of a 20-goal Premier League season. Only Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23) and Erling Haaland (22) scored more goals than him in the top flight this season.",
      "Just like Cunha, Mbeumo is a ready-made and proven Premier League attacker. Since the start of the 2023/24 campaign, Cunha and Mbeumo have plundered 56 Premier League goals between them.",
      "For context, that is only 45 goals fewer than what United scored collectively in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 Premier League campaigns combined. The prospect of Mbeumo joining Cunha at Old Trafford instantly strengthens United's attack.",
      "In 2024/25, United scored just 44 league goals, with only Everton (42) and the three relegated teams (36, 33 & 26) scoring fewer. Defensively, however, United boasted a better record than Brentford and Brighton & Hove Albion, who both achieved top ten finishes.",
      "United sieved 54 league goals this term, meaning they finished the campaign with a negative goal difference of -10. Of course, that record needs to improve next term, but their defensive record was not their biggest fault this campaign.",
      "United only conceded three more goals than Aston Villa and six more than Newcastle United, both of whom will play in Europe next season. The difference was that Villa scored 14 goals more and Newcastle 24 goals more than the Reds did.",
      "But less than a week into the first stage of this summer's transfer window, United are trying to bridge that gap by recruiting established Premier League attackers. Not since the 2017/18 campaign have the Reds signed attacking players on a permanent basis from a Premier League counterpart.",
      "Mbeumo would provide United with a multi-functional profile that could see him play as a No.10, a right wing-back and up front. The general consensus at this stage, though, is that he will operate as a No.10, leaving the No.9 berth in need of filling.",
      "It is no secret United are determined to sign a striker this summer, and after missing out on Liam Delap, who has joined Chelsea from Ipswich Town, it remains to be seen in which direction their search for a goal-getter will head in.",
      "They continue to be strongly linked with Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli star Victor Osimhen, who have both established themselves as two of Europe's most prolific strikers in recent seasons. Gyokeres netted 54 goals for Sporting this term and Osimhen found the back of the net 37 times on loan at Galatasaray.",
      "It means the prospect of United adding Mbeumo and Gyokeres to their crop of attackers would find themselves adding 74 goals to the 17 they have already inherited from Cunha.",
      "The prospect of ending the summer having signed three attackers that scored 91 goals in 2024/25 would represent a serious statement of intent. Of course, there are no guarantees they will replicate similar or identical numbers at Old Trafford, but United cannot be criticised for going in search of ready-made talent to come in and attempt to hit the ground running.",
      "In comparison, the last two summer transfer windows saw United gamble on potential in Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee and both moves failed to pay off.",
      "Suddenly, their biggest weakness might become their biggest strength."

      "Manchester United insist they remain compliant with financial fair play rules laid out by UEFA and the Premier League after releasing financial results that showed the picture at Old Trafford was improving.",
      "United are set to open the transfer window by spending around £120million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. A £62.5million deal for Cunha has already been agreed with Wolves, while negotiations continue with the Bees for Mbeumo.",
      "The spending has surprised some observers after United laid off around 450 staff over the previous year. Sir Jim Ratcliffe painted a bleak financial picture earlier in 2025, suggesting the club was on course to run out of money by the end of the year.",
      "United also missed out on European football for next season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham, but they have made an aggressive start to the window as they look to reshape Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Their latest financial results for the first three months of 2025 have revealed a more encouraging picture, and United played down concerns around breaches of UEFA's FFP rules and the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "\"The club remains committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules and UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Regulations,\" they said in a statement accompanying the results.",
      "These results include the salary savings after around 250 staff were made redundant last summer and show a significant reduction in costs, which has enabled the club to post a healthier picture and free up room in the budget for is privately described as \"disciplined investment in players this summer\".",
      "The result was an increase in revenues of 17.4%, mostly due to participation in the Europa League knockout stages, when a year ago, United were out of Europe entirely at this stage. Operating costs fell by 20.4%, partly due to the redundancies that have been made. There was also a reduction in the player wage budget due to a 25% salary decrease due to the club not qualifying for the Champions League",
      "Omar Berrada, CEO, said: “We were proud to reach the final of the UEFA Europa League, but ultimately, we were disappointed to finish as runner-up in Bilbao. We had a difficult season in the Premier League, which we all know fell below our standards and we have a clear expectation of improvement next season.",
      "\"We have been pleased with the performance of our women’s team, with a third placed league finish, enabling us to qualify for the UEFA Champions League and once again reaching the FA Cup final. We followed this by reaching the final of 2 the inaugural World Sevens Series. We extended the contract of head coach, Marc Skinner, reflecting the excellent work he has done with the team this season.",
      "“We remain focused on infrastructure, with the redevelopment of our Carrington training complex continuing and on track, which will be the heart of our club, providing world class facilities for all our teams and our staff.",
      "\"We have also announced our aspiration to pursue a new 100,000 seat stadium, sitting at the heart of the regeneration of the Old Trafford area, which would be a catalyst for growth and investment in our local community. We are continuing to work with all the relevant stakeholders, including central Government, to support their vision for growth.”",
      "The positive results have seen the club increase their expected revenue for the financial year ending June 2025 to £660million to £670million, which would be a return to the levels they were posting before the Covid-19 pandemic put a hole in the balance sheet."

      "United may well splash more than £120million on the pair but the Reds will continue to chase a new centre forward.",
      "Liam Delap was earmarked as the top target given his goals for relegated Ipswich last season and his £30million release clause, but the 22-year-old rejected Old Trafford advances and instead joined Chelsea.",

      "That kind of goal return will take a significant amount of pressure off a central striker. So while Rasmus Hojlund, who has interest from Serie A, would still need to improve and show he can contribute effectively for United, the Dane or teammate Joshua Zirkee - who also struggled in front of goal last season and perhaps looks more at home in a withdrawn position - could have a future with a prolific and dynamic pair behind.",
      "United will seek to move on a quartet of forwards with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho all surplus to requirements.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo remains one of United's best academy prospects, and yet there is a scenario where selling him makes more sense than the current turbulent situation that the Reds find themselves in. Under Amorim, it feels like there isn't a position where he fits seamlessly.",
      "This summer, United need decide do they find a way to fit Mainoo into Amorim's system or do they sell him and add further funds to the budget. Unusually, there is no right or wrong answer.",
      "It seems unlikely that Andre Onana will be sold this summer and if that's the case, Altay Bayindir will likely leave. To replace the Turkish shot stopper, United cannot look to another second choice who is not consistent enough nor has the ability to compete with Onana.",
      "The lack of competition has only hindered the Cameroonian. Bayindir's replacement needs to be a goalkeeper who can compete with Onana - Emiliano Martinez could be that option, albeit he has not always endeared himself with the United fanbase.",
      "Harry Maguire, like a lot of players in this squad, is not going to be the future. His deal expires in 2026 and there is a scenario where he leaves.",
      "Should that possibility be likely, United need to be planning now for life without Maguire. A sixth centre-back is needed considering Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof's departures.",
      "Perhaps Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi is an option for United. He would add that much-needed calmness to the defence that the Reds crave and he already has experience of playing at the toughest stage."

Under Amorim, Mbeumo will likely be used in a central role as opposed to out on the right side, his natural position, but he does have experience playing down the middle which should reassure supporters."

      "Bryan Mbeumo potentially becoming the second player Manchester United agree to sign since the summer transfer window reopened suggests Ruben Amorim has a new role in mind for Bruno Fernandes next season.",
      "United have made an opening transfer offer worth £55million to Brentford; £45million guaranteed plus £10million with add-ons. However, that bid falls short of their asking price.",
      "Talks are set to continue - with Mbeumo making it clear he wants to join United. The west London club is holding out for a fee similar to the £62.5million release clause that United will pay Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "Brentford believe they are similar players and, should both become teammates at United, appear set to play off a main striker for head coach Amorim in his preferred 3-4-3 formation next season. Cunha, seemingly, would operate from the left, with Mbeumo then coming in off the right.",
      "Both could conceivably play as the centre-forward, but with the former coming in as a playmaker to accompany Liam Delap, before the England under-21 international signed for Chelsea, that was seemingly not their initial plan. Mbeumo has played as a striker, but more often in a 3-5-2 alongside another forward, such as Yoane Wissa.",
      "Possibly adding Mbeumo on top of Cunha, the squad now has several options for their two attacking roles behind whoever their centre-forward will be. Amad and Mason Mount ended last season in those positions, but Fernandes filled one of those roles before those two returned from injury this spring.",
      "However, with the added depth in that particular area, it appears the Portugal regular will more regularly play as a central midfielder rather than in a more advanced position next term. Last season was the most that Fernandes has played in such a deep role at United, a trend that will seemingly continue into Amorim's first full campaign.",
      "That is, of course, if he stays put at the club this summer. Fernandes has turned down one proposal from Al-Hilal after seriously considering leaving United to join the Saudi Pro League side.",
      "Amorim, however, said last month that he did not expect Fernandes to depart. \"I don't know for sure; nobody knows,\" the United coach acknowledged in Hong Kong during the club's post-season tour. \"But I don't think so.",
      "\"He is seeing us changing some actions to change all the things, and I think he wants to stay.",
      "\"He is saying no to a lot of things. But he shows that he wants to win.",
      "\"He is really hungry. He is really good. He needs to be in the best league in the world.",
      "\"I am the manager, the coach, sometimes this is the decisions of the player. Of course, I talk to him, I explain things, and I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course, in a lot of games, he is frustrated. He knows what we are doing. The feeling I get every time I speak with him is that he wants to continue for sure with United, but you never know.\"",
      "Amorim also added: \"Yes, I have a clear idea what we want. As you know, we are a bit limited, and we can't do it all in one summer. But there is a clear picture of what we want.",
      "\"Let's wait and see, but we have a clear picture of what we want next season.\""

      "Inter Milan are awaiting Cristian Chivu's decision before deciding whether to pursue a move for Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund, it has been reported. The former Romanian international is set for a crucial meeting on Friday that could see him take over as the club's new manager following Simone Inzaghi's departure for Al Hilal.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims that a deal that will see the manager take over at Inter is done, with the new boss signing a two-year deal at the San Siro.",
      "Hojlund is being considered by the Serie A and Champions League runners-up, partly due to the strong relationship between his agents and the San Siro hierarchy. However, Inter bosses will wait for Chivu's arrival from Parma before deciding whether to proceed with a deal, according to reports in Italy.",
      "The Serie A side have already welcomed midfielder Luca Sucic, and Luis Henrique is expected to finalise a move from Marseille. However, forwards Joaquin Correa and Marko Arnautovic are both set to leave.",
      "Yet Ange-Yoan Bonny, who has attracted interest from the Premier League, could still thwart a move for Hojlund. Chivu coached the player at Parma, where he scored six goals and provided four assists in Serie A this season.",
      "Nonetheless, Inter are keen to act swiftly in the transfer market, and as a result, United will soon know if they have a potential buyer. Although Inter may seek a bargain deal for the striker United signed for £72million from Atalanta, amid interest across Italy.",
      "The Danish international has struggled to shine at Old Trafford during two challenging seasons. Hojlund has netted 26 goals in 95 appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "However, the forward's difficulties in front of goal have been echoed by the team as a whole, with United scoring just 44 goals in the Premier League last season. In response, the club has sought to bolster its attacking line under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million has already been completed, while a move for Liam Delap was unsuccessful as he opted for Chelsea instead. Attention is now focused on securing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo, who impressed with 20 goals for Brentford last season.",
      "Despite the challenges faced by the player, United's head coach Amorim has come to his defence, albeit while acknowledging the need for improvement. \"I'm happy, of course all the team has to improve, but the way he runs, he fights for every ball, loses a lot of duels, wins some duels, he needs to improve the connection. But he is improving, he said.",
      "\"I'm really happy with him, he just needs to continue working hard and better things will come.\""

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for three of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history each, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "19) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",
      "",
      "20) Robert Sanchez – £20m/€23m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nWhile not the signing Chelsea most desperately wanted from Brighton, they nevertheless did not return empty-handed from their protracted Moises Caicedo negotiations as Sanchez headed to Stamford Bridge to provide competition for the No.1 entry on this list. Chelsea have obviously put him up for sale again.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘desperately searching’ for a buyer for a flop signing, as they have been torn to pieces by former coach Rene Meulensteen, who labelled his signing “stupid business.”",
      "United have just completed their worst season in Premier League history. Never before have they finished as low as 15th in the table.",
      "Some players ended the season with credit in the bank, though they were largely the ones who were not actually representing United. Indeed, Antony headed out on loan to Real Betis for half the season, where he scored nine goals and assisted five.",
      "It was felt that might have put him in contention for a place back at United, though GIVEMESPORT states Antony ‘still has no future’ under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Indeed, it’s stated the club are ‘desperately searching for a buyer’ for the winger. Their preference is to offload him permanently, and United will ask for just £30million in order to do that.",
      "They have, though, refused to rule out a loan with an obligation to buy if no buyers come forward before the back end of the window, and it’s felt Betis have a ‘golden opportunity’ to land Antony on loan again after his first period there.",
      "Former United coach Meulensteen, who was Sir Alex Ferguson’s right-hand man, is in agreement that Antony should not return.",
      "“I wouldn’t bring Antony back because I’ve seen enough of him that he’s not cut out for the club and not good enough,” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",
      "“His performances are fuelled by his personality and are not for the good of the team, he’s selfish. You will never get your £80m back from Antony. I thought it was stupid business at the time when I heard it was happening.",
      "“I know that when they heard about the deal in Amsterdam, they were doing cartwheels. It shows again that players in those lower leagues, like Holland, are completely different. They’re playing very different styles, a slower tempo.",
      "“Teams like Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are the best, so it’s easy for them to look good.",
      "“But coming into the Premier League is so much different. What is Antony’s return? How many goals and assists has he got? He’s probably got as many, if not more, in Spain than in England, that different kind of football is more ideal for him.”",
      "Another player United are willing to sell, Alejandro Garnacho, has not impressed Meulensteen.",
      "“Garnacho is the same as Antony. Yes, he’s a young boy but, personality-wise, some things are not right with him and he’s bad for the club. That shows in his performances and lack of consistency.",
      "“He’s a young player who has good value to him, so if they were to get offered any sort of money, they should cut their losses, because he isn’t going to live up to his potential at Old Trafford and that can free up some money to spend elsewhere.”",
      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally.",
      "Ex-Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster has hit out at Alejandro Garnacho’s behaviour this season and thinks his haircut in the Europa League final summed him up.",
      "Jadon Sancho could replace Antony at Real Betis this summer as Man Utd set their price for the Brazilian, according to reports.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are interested in signing Man Utd centre-back Lisandro Martinez this summer as well as Alejandro Garnacho, according to reports.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "A Manchester United star has said goodbye to “one of the most beautiful chapters of my life” as he gave his feelings on “coming home” from his current club."

      "There’s encouragement from Europe for Arsenal and Manchester United fans, but Manchester City’s urgency is evident…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nRashford wants to join Barca. Of course he does. And Barca might be willing to accommodate him if they can’t get other targets. But Rashford certainly seems more motivated than Barca, which is a problem for the striker and United. If it happens, it won’t be any time soon. And it will almost certainly be a loan deal to start.",
      "",
      "19) Nico Williams – Athletic Bilbao to Arsenal\nOwing to Williams’ not-prohibitive release clause, this should be relatively simple if Arsenal really want to do it. But their interest is complicated by other costs that might be involved in signing the winger, for whom a new deal in Bilbao is not out of the question. This one seems to be getting further away, not closer. And it’s hard to ignore the spectre of Barca here.",
      "",
      "18) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Chelsea\nLiverpool were linked with the France forward but Chelsea have made an approach to Eintracht Frankfurt. The Blues’ problem: the Germans want £85million and they have little motivation to dramatically lower that demand.",
      "",
      "17) Mohammed Kudus 🆕 – West Ham to Chelsea\nThere’s a lot of noise around Kudus in recent days, the most recent suggesting he’s been offered to Chelsea for £85million. Kind offer, but not one the Blues are likely to take West Ham up on without a hefty discount. Robert Sanchez could be a makeweight.",
      "",
      "16) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Napoli\nRuben Amorim has made it painfully clear that Garnacho has no future at Old Trafford, which is a problem when they are asking for £60million. Napoli will not pay that. We await the awkwardness of Garnacho returning to United for pre-season before the serious conversations start.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Wirtz next? The last five times every Premier League club broke transfer record",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal seemed to be heavy favourites to land Gyokeres but the Gunners are faffing while they suss out which striker they can do a better deal for. Right now, it’s gone a little quiet between Arsenal and Gyokeres and there seems to be more noise around the other fella.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nMartinez seems to have said his goodbyes to Villa and though he was linked with Barcelona, it seems the Catalans are pushing forward on a deal for Joan Garcia. There is renewed speculation of United’s intent to move for Martinez, for whom they made an offer in January, according to one report.",
      "👉 Martinez need not act the d*** if he’s Man Utd’s pick to replace oblivious Onana",
      "",
      "13) Viktor Gyokeres 🆕 – Sporting to Manchester United\nWitH Arsenal yet to make a decision, there are plenty of reports that Gyokeres is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "10) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to West Ham\nGiven Ramsdale’s habit of getting relegated, do West Ham really want to do this? Apparently so. Talks have taken place, with the Hammers set to be liable for £20million unless they can play on the fact Saints want the keeper’s £100k-a-wages off their books.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nApparently unmoved by the Champions League, Mbeumo has stated his preference for United over Newcastle, Arsenal and Spurs, but Brentford, not unreasonably, want a similar fee to that the Red Devils gave Wolves for Matheus Cunha. A first bid went in – £45million plus £10million – which was doomed to fail. A second ‘take-it-or-leave-it- offer is imminent.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker has overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack.  After much deliberation, it seems the Gunners favour a deal with RB Leipzig over whatever they could get out of Sporting. Talk have taken place ‘in the last 48 hours’ and seem to be progressing nicely.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea have made it clear to Milan they are keen on the France keeper, but they won’t pay the £25million the Rossoneri want for a player entering the final year of his contract. Chelsea are said to be offering £10million for now, so there is some talking to be done. But whatever they pay up, it will be worth it.",
      "6) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool may have had one bid worth £109million turned down but the Reds have gone balls out for Wirtz and they won’t walk away over a few euros, especially when the player has matched their intent by stating he wants Anfield over the Allianz Arena. Once Wirtz gets international duty out of the way this weekend, we can expect some progress.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "5) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. Reports suggest there is no reason for Arsenal fans to panic, with agreements in place between all parties. We’ll see next week after the international break.",
      "4) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity got the easy part – they have agreed personal terms with Cherki – done early and have reportedly struck a deal with Lyon. City are in a hurry, so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed in the next week.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord is it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides.",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders – AC Milan to Manchester City\nIt’s pretty much done, apparently. City have agreed a fee of £46million to sign the midfielder, with Milan hoping to net another £12.5million in add-ons. Reijnders and Rodri in midfield? City won’t be sh*t again next season.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Rayan Ait-Nouri – Wolves to Manchester City \nEveryone seems to be going with the line that a deal is done for what looks like a knockdown £33.7million fee. City want it done before next week and a medical is imminent."

They’re a huge club that are currently going through problems, but they will always attract players. At this point, those players must be the right ones. Cunha and Mbuemo can hopefully be that for them.”",

      "Heskey added: “Viktor Gyokeres would be a good signing for Manchester United. He has already played under Ruben Amorim and has played in England before. He has already shown that he can play in the system that Amorim prefers, he looks ideal.",
      "“His goal record this season was brilliant, he knows what the club means having played in England and he would fit well into Amorim’s system.”"

But first, since you mentioned Rashford, no one has said he was the bastion of great attitude *off* the pitch. Apparently, his main crime *on* the pitch is not being a pressing forward. If you’re going there, maybe we should castigate Bruno for not being able to tackle? I couldn’t give a rats about what a player does that isn’t illegal off the pitch. Garnacho apparently trains well. Shame he can’t deliver when it actually matters.",
      "I’m sure off the pitch Bruno is a model professional, but on the pitch he’s a whiny baby who will often prefer to shout at someone (referee, team mates, the sky, the grass) rather than get back into position or show for the pass. He spent a solid 30 seconds in one incident in the EL Final, when Maguire was desperately trying to pass to him, shouting at someone or other rather than paying any attention to the actual match actually going on and that we were losing to actual Spurs. If you don’t recall the match, it’s one of those “off” games that Bruno has occasionally – usually when we face anyone decent or who sit deep.",
      "Bruno was never world class. No (other?) big club has ever shown interest in him. He can create chances, as long as they mostly involve pinging the ball out wide. Down the middle, not so much. You want to give him huge credit for passing to Mainoo? It was decent for sure, but the movement by Mainoo for it (and the finish), and arguably the Rashford ping out to Garnacho, was better. The fact that this kind of pass is so unusual as to be worth mentioning is telling in itself.",
      "As far as selfish, yes, I stand by that. He’s missed as many big chances as he’s created all season, certainly in the league. Missed. Those were opportunities where a less selfish player would look for the pass to someone in a better position. I wonder where Garnacho got this “me first” attitude? Yes, he’s seemed to produce good numbers. In a team where he is the sole focus of creating chances. That he led to two of our worst finishes back to back. Brilliant!",
      "In the context of the club, yeah that’s a little tongue in cheek but it was him that said he would go if the club decided to let him. Then they let him, and he decided not to. Because HE doesn’t want to play at a lower level. And while I get that, he’s only going to be declining from here on. 31 when the season starts. Him staying has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else but his ego, just like his Hollywood passes.",
      "The sad thing is that this makes a problem for everyone else in the squad. Mainoo has been promised to play at 8 as a regular starter if he signs da ting. And we’re now signing two other 10s, with the supposed view that Amad moves to RWB.",

      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "12) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "13) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "14) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "15) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "16) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "17) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "18) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle. To make matters worse, Eto’o won the Treble with Inter.",
      "",
      "19) Diego Costa – £57m/€65m (Chelsea to Atletico Madrid, December 2017)\nProof that Chelsea used to be incredible at this transfer lark: they signed Liverpool target Diego Costa from Atletico for £32m in 2014 and built two title-winning teams around his 20-goal seasons, before Antonio Conte dumped the Spain international over text and theoretically torched his valuation by publicly ostracising him, yet Atletico – serving a transfer ban – bought the 29-year-old back for £25m more than they sold him despite Costa not having played for months. And in a miserable second Atleti spell, he scored 19 goals in 81 games, moving to Brazil for free before they won the title.",
      "",
      "20) Edinson Cavani – £55.6m/€64m (Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2013)\n“The transfer of Edinson Cavani is further proof of the club’s ability to attract the best players in the world. The player was seduced by the club’s sporting project,” added PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, and those tittering in the back can shush. Can’t complain after 200 goals and 21 trophies.",

      "A Manchester United flop is reportedly ‘not satisfied’ with his time at Old Trafford, and could look to return to the last country he played in, where a Champions League finalist is interested in him.",
      "Almost no United players had good seasons last time out. Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo were probably the only vaguely positive stories in an otherwise very underwhelming campaign.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final. In the league, central strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both played over 30 games, but neither man managed more than four goals.",
      "Hojlund scored four in 32 games, and according to Caught Offside, he’s not enjoying his time at United and could look to go back to Italy, where he was signed from.",
      "Indeed, Alfredo Pedulla wrote for the site: ‘Finally, keep an eye on Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane is not satisfied with his time in Manchester and is considering a return to Italy. Several clubs (including Inter) are interested in him and he’d be an excellent option for those seeking a dynamic and already proven striker.’",
      "It would be a shocking turn of events if a striker who was not able to reach five Premier League goals for United managed to secure a transfer to a Champions League finalist.",
      "However, Inter have indeed been linked with Hojlund. In May, an Italian outlet suggested Inter headed the queue for Hojlund, as he’d been made the dream signing for the attack a couple of years ago, before eventually going to United.",
      "Despite the Dane having had a very underwhelming season, Inter’s interest has not faded. They reportedly see his poor seasons as an ‘accident along the way’ to him becoming a top striker.",
      "It’s believed they wanted him on a loan with an obligation to buy him. Whether that formula is still the way they are going to go is unclear, but Pedulla certainly suggests that Inter still want Hojlund.",
      "In one season in Italy, with Atalanta, the striker scored 10 goals in all competitions and assisted four more. He scored more than that in his first season at United, but did much worse this term.",
      "As such, if Hojlund were to move to Inter, they’d hope they don’t get the version of him that the Red Devils saw this term."

      "That “big impact” was almost unfathomably quick from Jesus when he did arrive at the Etihad the following January. It was decided that Jesus would stay in Brazil to complete their league season and inspire Palmeiras to a first national championship in 22 years, being named player of the year in the process.",
      "With Jesus making his Selecao debut in September 2016, scoring five goals and assisting four in his first six caps by the end of the year, having helped guide his country to Olympics gold a fortnight after the confirmation of his impending move to England, it was clear Manchester City had spotted a talent.

      "The Gambia winger signed for the Magpies in summer 2023, from Danish side OB. Immediately, he was loaned to Feyenoord, where he scored 10 goals. The expectation was for Minteh, now 19, to return to Newcastle and push for a first-team place, but PSR put paid to that.",

      "When the final whistle blew at the Championship play-off final to condemn Leeds to another season of second-tier scrambling, immediately the focus at Elland Road switched to sales. Gray, a prodigious, versatile England Under-21 international, was comfortably their most sellable asset, despite the sour taste that selling one of their own might leave.",

      "Eyebrows might have been raised when Porto commanded such preposterous money for a teenager with a single league start and goal to his name. Silva’s entire professional career consisted of 781 minutes and three goals when Jorge Mendes worked his magic.",

      "With Monaco banking an initial fee of £36m, add-ons made up the rest of the £57.6m total possible payment.

      "Hell, Lavia’s whole career consisted of just seven matches by that point, so prodigious was his excellence in the Manchester City youth set-up.",
      "Premier League relegation did little to dim that light as Lavia was the silver lining to that miserable Saints cloud. And while Liverpool sniffed around, Arsenal and Manchester United were linked and Manchester City held first dibs, Chelsea were not to be deterred.",

      "Matheus Cunha has joined after United triggered his £62.5m release clause and a new bid is expected to be made for Bryan Mbeumo – who ‘wants to join’ the Red Devils – after Brentford rejected their initial £45m offer with £10m in add-ons.",
      "Brentford are asking for £60m for Mbeumo, while reports claim United are ‘prepared to meet Mbeumo’s whopping wage demands’ which stand at £250,000 a week, equating to £13m a year.",
      "The pair will likely play in the two inverted No.10 roles in Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, but United are also desperately looking for a new striker, with Rasmus Hojlund failing to meet the mark for them in his two seasons at the club.",
      "They were keen on Ipswich’s Liam Delap, but he’s opted to join Chelsea, but that move could open the door to Nicolas Jackson’s exit from Stamford Bridge, with United supposedly ‘interested’ in the Senegal international along with several other suitors.",
      "But according to a report on Wednesday, Amorim remains convinced that Gyokeres – who shone under the Portuguese boss in their time at Sporting together – is the man to lead the Red Devils’ line.",
      "The report claimed ‘Amorim has made it clear to the Old Trafford hierarchy that he is desperate to seal a reunion with the Sporting star’ having been ‘not happy to see Delap pinpointed as Manchester United’s leading target’, with Gyokeres the striker he’s wanted all along.",

      "And now transfer expert Ben Jacobs has revealed that Gyokeres is ‘very keen’ on a move to Old Trafford and explained how they can get the deal done for the 27-year-old.",

So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",

      "Former Manchester United man Paul Parker has hailed a Red Devils target as a “dream signing” but feels he’s currently at the “best club in the world to play for.”",
      "United are moving quickly this summer to ensure they are more competitive than their 15th-placed Premier League finish this season. Indeed, they have already landed Wolves forward Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal.",
      "They have also been given confidence over getting Bryan Mbeumo through the door. It was recently stated by transfer insider David Ornstein that the Brentford forward wants to join United, with the club to open talks.",
      "United have done so, and their opening bid is said to have been worth £55million, which is ‘some way below’ the Bees’ asking price.",
      "In any case, it’s felt Mbeumo would be perfect for United, per former Red Devil Parker.",
      "He told aceodds.com: “Mbeumo has been absolutely unbelievable. He’s had a completely absurd season, and he has only improved since Ivan Toney left the club. What he’s done for Brentford is incredible.",
      "“He owes a lot to Thomas Frank. This is yet another example of why Frank is one of the best managers in the world, because he gets the best out of his players. He’s outstanding.",
      "“He would be a brilliant signing for United. A magical signing, because he would be a massive step up from the other players. He would be a dream signing. But does he actually want to leave Brentford? Honestly, I’m not sure.",
      "“It’s a fantastic club and if you take away things like money and status, Brentford might just be the best club to play for in the world.”",
      "Though Brentford finished far above United in the Premier League this season – 10th compared to 15th – reports from trusted sources state Mbeumo does indeed want to go to Old Trafford",
      "The wages on offer there would surely be more than at Brentford. Indeed, the Red Devils are said to be prepared to meet Mbeumo’s wage demands of £250,000 per week.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are reportedly the only players who currently earn more than that at United. But Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals this season, which is a better tally than any United player achieved.",
      "Man Utd have submitted an ‘improved offer’ to sign Cameroon international Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘set’ to submit an ‘improved second bid’ as they look to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Manchester United have been warned that they face being “stung” as they look to edge out rivals to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "A former Manchester United man has told a current Red Devil he should find a new club, as he has “no standout qualities” and “nobody knows what he’s actually good ...",
      "Man Utd’s £55m bid for Mbeumo is ‘some way below’ Brentford’s asking price, but the Red Devils have been handed a ‘major boost’ in their bid to sign him.",
      "Man Utd are ramping up their summer plans with Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson rising up their shortlist of targets, according to reports."

      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 08:02, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered a four-player shortlist of players Manchester United must let go this summer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window as United boss is a crucial one as he tries to assemble a squad capable of bouncing back from an all-time Premier League low finish of 15th place.",

      "However, Neville believes there will be an emphasis on outgoings with an inevitability surrounding some members of the squad. The former United captain believes Marcus Rashford is among the players who must leave this window.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has to leave Manchester United. That ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club,\" said Neville on The Overlap show, It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "\"With Jadon Sancho, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him,\" Neville said.",
      "\"From Jadon's point of view, he has to make sure he parts ways with Manchester United.\"",
      "Neville also namedropped Alejandro Garnacho and Antony as two names who should also be shown the door after both players have recently publicly expressed that their respective futures at Old Trafford are uncertain. Last month, Antony said he is \"smiling and happy\" since joining Real Betis on loan.",
      "On Antony, Neville said: \"His interview was absolutely spot on. I would imagine he was absolutely going under while at United. He's gone to Spain and is absolutely suited down to the ground with Spanish football.",
      "\"Over there, there is a different tactical awareness, technical ability, which is better suited to him. There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"Antony is perfect for Spain, and United should facilitate him leaving. Best for United, best for the club.\"",
      "After United's defeat to Spurs, Garnacho spoke to the media after the game to express his discontent at not starting the game. \"We'll see what happens,\" said Garnacho regarding his future after a scathing review of his side's performances.",
      "\"If players are taking on the manager, and if players are questioning the manager in public, through social media, the manager has to win, or the manager has to leave,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",
      "\"That type of thing will happen with him, but he'll have to go. That's not me throwing my toys out the pram, saying he has to go, but for the club and for him it's right that he goes.\"",

      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",
