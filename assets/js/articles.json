      "Manchester United and Everton face off in a highly anticipated Premier League Summer Series clash as both clubs continue their preparations for the 2025/26 season. The Red Devils are eager to build momentum after a poor 2024/25 campaign, with new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo looking to make their mark.",
      "Everton, meanwhile, are entering a new era as they gear up for their debut season at the state-of-the-art Hill Dickinson Stadium. However, their pre-season has got off to a rocky start with a heavy 3-0 defeat to Brighton on Day 1 of the Summer Series, and a 2-1 defeat to West Ham on Day 2.",
      "The friendly between Manchester United and Everton is being held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, USA, with a capacity of 82,500. The match kicks off at 7pm local time on Saturday, July 26, which translates to 12am UK time on Sunday, July 27.",
      "Alternatively, NOW TV passes are available for non-subscribers. MUTV will also broadcast the game live for subscribers, accessible via Sky (channel 418) or Virgin Media (channel 526). For US viewers, the match will be shown on NBC Sports.",
      "Summer arrivals Cunha and Mbeumo are expected to be involved for United, with Ruben Amorim's new-look attack beginning to take shape. While Cunha has already featured heavily for the club this summer, Mbeumo has been left out of their initial pre-season games to allow him to build some fitness up, and could make his official bow against Everton.",
      "As for the Toffees, summer signings Carlos Alcaraz, Thierno Barry and Mark Travers - all of whom have made their debuts - are expected to be given run outs. However, the fixture may come a little too early for the club's latest capture, Adam Aznou, whose move from Bayern Munich was confirmed on Tuesday.",
      "After facing Everton, United will head back to the UK for their final pre-season game: a clash with Fiorentina at Old Trafford. The match will take place on Saturday, August 9 ahead of their Premier League opener against Arsenal eight days later.",
      "Like United, David Moyes' men are set to travel back to England after the game, with a final pre-season tie with Roma to come. The game will take place on August 9 at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, marking the Everton senior team's first ever fixture there.",
      "The Toffees then kick off their Premier League campaign against newly-promoted Leeds United on August 18, before hosting Brighton on Merseyside on August 24 in what will be the first competitive match at their new ground.",

      "Gary Neville has been taunted by Salford City's rivals Crewe Alexandra on social media after his side's opening day defeat this weekend.",
      "The Manchester United legend cut a glum figure on Saturday afternoon as his Salford side were dealt a 3-1 loss by Crewe at home in their first League Two clash of the season.",
      "Kadeem Harris' own goal had given the away side the lead in the eighth minute before he made up for his gaffe by getting Neville's men level moments later.",
      "But Crewe quickly took control of the game just before the half time interval as Conor Thomas netted a brace in the space of a few minutes.",
      "Salford could not stage a fight back after the break and Neville was seen looking downbeat in the stands as he was pictured inside the directors' box holding up a hand against the window.",
      "And Crewe couldn't resist teasing the former England defender as they posted the picture of Neville holding up his hand, showing five fingers, and writing: \"Nah it was three Gary.\"",
      "The cheeky post went down a hit with football fans on Twitter as one joined in with the fun, adding: \"Clearly saying it should have been five by half time.\"",
      "Another wrote: \"Counting how many places off the bottom of the league they are,\" as a third said: \"It should have been how many Gary?\"",
      "Neville has been one of the owners of Salford since 2014, agreeing to purchase the club alongside fellow Class of 92 members David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and brother Phil - as well as businessman Peter Lim.",
      "However, Neville acquired Lim's stake in the club in 2024 and this year it was announced that only Neville and Beckham remained shareholders out of the Class of 92 legends following a takeover by a new ownership group.",
      "Neville has often shared pictures and videos of himself following Salford City and he left heartbroken last season after the team finished eighth - just one spot off the play-off places.",
      "Salford is one of many business interests Neville is invested in after starting the Hotel Football group in Manchester.",
      "He has also started an investment firm called Relentless, which has invested in restaurants and properties, and media group Buzz 16, which runs his Overlap podcast content.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will look to six players to lead the team this season after forming a new leadership group - with captain Bruno Fernandes being followed by Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Tom Heaton and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Amorim is hoping for a clean slate in the 2025-26 season as he looks to turn the club's fortunes around following a disastrous last campaign that saw them finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon boss came under fire after failing to stop the rot after making their worst ever start to a league season under Erik ten Hag, who was sacked last October.",
      "Amorim has attempted to overhaul his squad after sending Marcus Rashford out on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have also been told to find new clubs. Christian Eriksen, Viktor Lindelof and Jonny Evans were released.",
      "He has started his rebuild by signing two high-profile players in forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who arrived for £63.5m and £71m respectively, but Amorim is not happy to stop there as he also looks to bring in Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "And the manager has also outlined plans for a leadership group who he hopes can give the team more stability this season - after watching the team fall apart and succumb to 17 league defeats in 2024-25.",
      "\"We have a leadership group now,\" Amorim said during a wide-ranging interview. \"It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group.",
      "\"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.",
      "\"So it's not just the oldest ones. Nous is in the group because he's a character that I like and I try to understand the dynamic of the group I try to reach every space. They are the guys responsible for keeping everyone in line.",
      "“I feel we're more organised now. We're so much better. What we eat, the way we behave on tour, on the pitch, the rules. I know they're not kids and I don't treat the players like kids. But I think these small rules can help a group to be strong. We have rules, and the rules are not to treat the players as babies.",
      "\"I treat them as men, but they have rules now and that can change the way you train. If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you - and I will show you in front of everybody. So I'm always on top. But in one sense I don't expect or need to do anything, because they will push each other. But if you train badly one time, I will show you the image. I will not speak with you, just speak. I will show everything.\"",
      "In the same interview, Amorim revealed he wanted to stay at United for 20 years and said he was confident of bringing the good times back to the club - but also admitted he feared going to games last season knowing knowing his side could lose games.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, it's not how I returned to my house after the games but how I left to go to the games,\" he said. \"All the struggles that we had in the games, I feel it before the games. So that is the hardest part. To go to the games and know that we are not going to be competitive.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has revealed he dreaded going to games last season because he knew his Manchester United side were not good enough to compete. Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag last November and won just seven of his 27 Premier League games, as United finished the season in 15th place.",
      "It led Amorim to question whether he was good enough to lead United and he even offered to quit with no compensation if the club felt that was right. But United stood by Amorim, who has carried on the task of reviving the fallen giants, after admitting he went into games last season fearing the worst.",
      "“To tell you the truth, it was not how I returned to my house after the games,” said Amorim, during a break from United's US tour. “It was how I left to go to the games, because I felt that sometimes we would struggle.",
      "“All the struggles that we had in the games, I could feel it before, so that was the hardest part - to go to the games and know that we were not going to be competitive, how we should be. That was the hardest part.",
      "“When I returned, I just looked to my family and tried to think about different things. But if you want to know the most difficult moment, it was before the games, because I knew that we will struggle in specific games.",
      "“I had the feeling during the season that I was so frustrated. I could do nothing, I acknowledged that, so I had to wait.",
      "“Being manager of Manchester United was like going to a fight with my hands like this [down by his side]. So that was the frustration.",
      "“There were some moments that were really hard on me, because I felt I was disappointing all of these people.",
      "“When you lose so many games it's hard on everybody to believe in one idea and all the changes. So there were moments when I was really, really frustrated.",
      "“I just don't want to return to that feeling that we're thinking that it's not a 50-50 game. I think we will be a better team. Not just because I truly believe we can be better. But I truly believe there are a lot of players who can do better - and I can be a better manager as well.”",
      "Managing United may be one of the most high-pressure jobs in world football, but Amorim has a healthy sense of perspective when it comes to his role. “This is not the moment I felt the most pressure in my life,” said Amorim. “I had a career as a player and I finished really soon because of injuries.",
      "“My wife and I had an Excel sheet with all of the money we had and all of the things that we needed, because I wanted to help my family. With all of that responsibility, I felt the pressure at that time.",
      "“Nowadays, I don't feel any pressure about that. It's more like an ego thing. I want to be manager of United for a while and I took five years to choose this club, so I don't want to fail. That's the only pressure.",
      "“The other pressure, the pressure at the end of my career as a footballer, was different. That was more difficult to deal with.”",

      "Winger Garnacho fell out with Amorim after he was dropped for the Europa League final, which United lost 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the defeat, Garnacho criticised Amorim's decision and said he would consider his future over the summer.",

      "Manchester United's summer recruit, Matheus Cunha, picked the Red Devils over Newcastle despite the Magpies having Champions League football this season, while Ruben Amorim's men are going without. Newcastle were heavily interested in bringing the tricky Wolves forward to the North East off the back of his impressive performances last year.",
      "Alongside the added incentive of being able to line up alongside his compatriots, Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton, the Brazilian was also said to be on the hunt for Champions League football at his next club, something Newcastle were able to provide.",
      "However, after qualifying on the final day of the campaign, which is set to guarantee the club £32million, Newcastle were rebuffed by the 26-year-old, despite being told a deal to secure Cunha hinged on European participation.",
      "Cunha stunned Toon officials by picking United instead. United wrapped up the deal for £62.5m despite Amorim's team finishing 15th last season and missing out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Reports suggested that the Red Devils were able to offer higher wages to Cunha, while the player himself later claimed United were indeed the team he supported as a youngster.",
      "\"It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player,\" he said after his signing was confirmed. \"Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.\"",
      "The overall maximum prize money for a participant in the Champions League is £137m, with Newcastle at least guaranteed £32m, meaning the Magpies were expecting a thrilling summer of deals. Yet Newcastle's transfer activity has been middling at best so far.",
      "Despite signing Anthony Elanga for £55m from Nottingahm Forest and securing Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan, Howe has seen a series of top targets elect to play their football elsewhere for this upcoming season. While Cunha headed to Manchester, another target, in the form of French striker Hugo Ekitike, joined Liverpool from Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford, who was eyed by Howe, later signed for Manchester City. Both Ipswich's Liam Delap and Brighton's Joao Pedro, who were fancied by Newcastle, then joined Chelsea, while former Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo also chose United over Newcastle.",
      "A move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is currently in the works, with Newcastle having had a £65.5m offer, with 4m in add-ons, rejected for the player. Fears are now rife at St James' Park that United will swoop in and steal the towering Slovenian forward, with Amorim holding a firm interest in the striker. If that were to happen, Sesko would be the third player this window to pick United over Newcastle.",
      "Matters have been compounded for Newcastle this summer after Liverpool lodged a £110m offer for superstar striker Alexander Isak. The Swedish star has made it clear he wishes to explore opportunities away from St James' Park but the club are determined to fight to keep him.",
      "Speaking about the situation, Howe said: \"I think from my situation, I am very much removed from everything that is happening back home.",
      "\"I was made aware there was a bid yesterday. That bid was turned down before I heard about it. There are people back in England dealing with the situation. I really don’t know what is going to happen next, but from our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.\"",

      "On-loan Marcus Rashford isn't inclined to give much away regarding a potential permanent move to Barcelona. The Manchester United forward has been sent to Catalonia for the upcoming campaign after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Rashford's temporary move to Barca gives the reigning kings of La Liga a chance to sign the player for £30million. That figure represents a fraction of Rashford's value just a couple of seasons ago prior to his stock plummeting at Old Trafford.",
      "However, there are still slight doubts regarding Barca's financial state and whether Rashford will be registered in time for the start of the season. La Liga's financial fair play laws have seen the club run into issues of late, with Dani Olmo and Pau Victor's eligibility coming into question last season.",
      "Spain star Olmo even missed playing time last term while Barcelona sought approval over their salary cap issues. But Rashford gave a laid-back response when asked about any potential pitfalls, having already made a couple of appearances for his new side in pre-season.",
      "\"I'm not worried,\" he told Catalan newspaper Sport, when asked about his registration concerns. \"It's something the club needs to resolve, and I trust they will. I'm focused on training and being ready for the start of the competition.\"",
      "Rashford then made his feelings clear on a permanent exit from United, insisting he just wants to \"enjoy the moment\" rather than think too far ahead. Rashford, 27, made his Barca debut in a 3-1 friendly win over Japanese outfit Vissel Kobe at the end of July. However, the arrival appeared to go awry as the England international came off the bench, only to be substituted off again after 30 minutes.",
      "The incident was framed as somewhat embarrassing for the player, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. However, new boss Hansi Flick was quick to dismiss any notions of humiliation, insisting the decision was purely to manage the player's fitness.",
      "\"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball,\" said Flick after that match. \"He’s a week behind the others. He hasn’t been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford impressed on loan under Unai Emery and helped Villa make a deep run in the Champions League. He should be back among Europe's elite this coming season, though the same can't be said for parent club United after they missed out on continental qualification altogether.",
      "It's also evident Rashford is putting his new team's needs ahead of any individual goals. And he believes his ability to contribute from different parts of the pitch puts him in good stead.",
      "\"I can play in different positions and score goals from any of them,\" he said. \"It's about creating chances from different areas and taking advantage of them.\"",
      "That's the kind of attitude that may just convince Barcelona to invest in his services in a permanent capacity. However, the United academy graduate has a long road ahead to prove he's worthy of the outlay.",

      "Manchester United’s £2bn new stadium is already in doubt with Sir Jim Ratcliffe reportedly refusing to pay the asking price for land required. The Red Devils unveiled stunning plans for a new home back in March.",
      "The plans involved their current Old Trafford base being demolished and replaced with a state-of-the-art, 100,000 capacity arena. Meanwhile, the whole area surrounding the stadium would be regenerated as part of a project anticipated to cost an eye-watering £2bn.",
      "There was initially hope that the stadium - dubbed the ‘Wembley of the North’ - would be finished by 2030. But the project has already been hit with a delay, with United struggling to buy land near to the site.",
      "According to The Guardian, the Red Devils need to own a critical site beside the ground currently belonging to freight company Freightliner. United currently value the land at around £40m to £50m but Freightliner instead have an asking price of closer to £400m.",
      "The disagreement has led to an impasse, with the difference in valuation delaying the plans for the new stadium for now. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham previously confirmed that no public funding would be used in the building of the stadium itself.",
      "But the government has offered their backing to the project, including the regeneration of the local area. A statement from Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves earlier this year read: “The Chancellor revealed today that she is championing a regeneration project around Old Trafford in Manchester that will see new housing, commercial and public space as a shining example of the bold pro-development model that will drive growth across the region, with authorities exploring setting up a mayoral development corporation body to redevelop the area.\"",
      "Unveiling the project back in March, Ratcliffe said: “Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world’s greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford.",
      "“Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience, only footsteps from our historic home.",
      "“Just as important is the opportunity for a new stadium to be the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area, creating jobs and investment, not just during the construction phase, but on a lasting basis when the stadium district is complete.",
      "\"The Government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sofyan Amrabat was decisively clear in his intention to reject Liverpool before signing for Manchester United. The midfielder, 28, was a player in demand after his impressive performances for Morocco in the 2022 World Cup as the African nation made it all the way to the semi-finals.",
      "Playing for Fiorentina at the time, among Amrabat's reported suitors were the Premier League side, then led by Jurgen Klopp, as well as the Red Devils, who were heading into their second season under Erik ten Hag.",
      "The tough-tackling midfielder looked to have been an ideal fit for the Reds, given they eventually parted ways with Jordan Henderson and Fabinho, who left Anfield for the Saudi Pro League in the summer of 2023.",
      "Having been with the Italian side since 2020, the Serie A outfit were ready to cash in on their star player, given his lofty value, with the club willing to sell Amrabat should a team meet their £25.8million (€30m) asking price.",
      "While United's number one target was to buy a new No. 9 - which they eventually did in Rasmus Hojlund - Ten Hag was said to have been targeting additional reinforcements in midfield following the £60m signing of Mason Mount, with Amrabat among his targets.",
      "The Dutchman was certainly familiar with Amrabat's game given he'd come through the academy of FC Utrecht while the current Bayer Leverkusen boss managed the Eredivisie side.",
      "The familiarity between the pair not only worked in United's favour but damaged Liverpool's transfer plans simultaneously. According to Corriere della Sera, via GFNI, Amrabat told Klopp he wouldn't be signing for him because he favoured the idea of reuniting with Ten Hag at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "After joining on loan for the 2023/24 season, he made 30 appearances in all competitions for United. Despite failing to impress for much of his stint, he improved at the end of the season and was praised for his performance in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "United opted not to sign him permanently, as he then joined Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce on loan last season before securing a permanent transfer to the Turkish giants this summer.",
      "Following his departure from the Premier League, he opened up about his exit and claimed Ten Hag wanted to keep him, but a deal could not be agreed upon for his return.",
      "Ahead of United's Europa League clash against Fenerbahce last year, he told The Mail: \"I have a special relationship with Ten Hag since I was a 20-year-old at Utrecht. He wanted to keep me this summer so I wish him the best but not for Thursday. I hope they lose.\"",

      "Arsenal opted against the signing of Benjamin Sesko in order to sign Viktor Gyokeres after deeming the RB Leipzig striker a high risk. Mikel Arteta's side finally announced the arrival of the Swede last month in what had been one of the biggest transfer sagas of the summer window.",
      "The two key striker targets for the Gunners ended up being Gyokeres and Sesko, but it was the 27-year-old who was preferred, with Sesko now at the centre of a battle between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "There was a time when the Slovenian, 22, looked set for a move to north London considering the club had amassed a year's worth of background work on his progress at RB Leipzig, according to ESPN.",
      "After engaging in preliminary talks with the Bundesliga outfit, Arsenal chiefs soon found that any deal for the promising forward would be too expensive for a player who has yet to realise his full potential.",
      "The story reported that there were three main reasons for a deal for Sesko setting off \"alarm bells\" including the mammoth fee Leipzig were requesting as well as his own personal terms.",
      "Having only had two seasons in a European top-five league - where he scored 21 goals across all competitions last season - sources said the club were wary about the mental demands Sesko would have to endure of being the player leading the Arsenal attack and whether he'd be able to handle the scrutiny.",
      "While Gyokeres has yet to establish himself in one of Europe's premier domestic leagues, his stunning record of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP as well as the confidence Arsenal had in the strength of his character saw them pull the trigger on a move for the striker.",
      "Sesko is reportedly yet to decide his next move, with Newcastle seeing their bid of just under £70m rejected after they turned down Liverpool's £110m offer for Alexander Isak. While Ruben Amorim's side have yet to table a formal offer for the 22-year-old, they remain intensely interested in bolstering their attacking ranks with his signature.",
      "However, Arsenal's reasons for pulling out of a deal for him could spark some concern at United, who know all about spending big money on young strikers who end up struggling to justify their price tag.",
      "The potential arrival of Sesko could spell the end of Rasmus Hojlund's Old Trafford career as Amorim admitted he remains unsure of whether the Dane - who said he wants to fight for his place - will remain a United player by the end of the month.",
      "United spent £72m on the 22-year-old and are already aware that his value has dropped significantly since joining due to his low scoring rate. They have reportedly slashed his price tag and would be willing to listen to offers for him for just £30m.",
      "Speaking after the striker scored in United's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in pre-season, the Red Devils boss said: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market.",
      "\"The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that's the most important thing. The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals.",
      "\"He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a a lot because of the lack of goals last season. But I think not just the goals, but the way Rasmus connects the play.",
      "\"Every time we have to kick the ball, we are kicking the ball when we are more pressed. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in the support is helping us to play a lot better and we are playing better because he's playing better.\"",

      "The South Korean forward relayed his intentions on Spurs' pre-season tour of his home country and he will leave a huge hole in Spurs boss Thomas Frank's final third. The Danish boss, while disappointed at the annoucement, will now have to quickly turn his attention to bolstering his frontline, with Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani reportedly at the top of his list.",
      "The France international was of interest to Spurs in January, but spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, where he scored 10 goals in 22 appearances. He has also courted many suitors in the past, famously Liverpool and Manchester United, while Cheslea have also been linked with the star.",
      "Back in January 2023, Sky Germany claimed that Kolo Muani decided against joining Jurgen Klopp at Anfield in what would have been a rumoured £88 million deal. The striker rebuffed the Reds in favour of staying at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Kolo Muani claimed he felt at ease at the Bundesliga side. However, after scoring 26 goals in just 50 games for Frankfurt, Muani was snapped up by PSG for £76.2m in September of that year.",
      "The 26-year-old could have also made his way to the Premier League via Old Trafford. A report from The Athletic stated that Kolo Muani and Rasmus Hojlund were United's top two forward targets in 2023, but the latter's age, profile and slightly cheaper price gave him the edge.",
      "After leaving both Premier League giants red-faced, Kolo Muani had a solid debut season for PSG, starting 40 times and scoring nine goals. Yet he struggled for minutes at PSG last season, scoring twice in 10 Ligue 1 appearances, and so a loan to Juve followed.",
      "He flourished in Serie A, scoring eight times in 16 games and registering one assist. His form was so impressive that Juventus are in for him again, but face stiff competition from Spurs.",
      "No offers have been lodged yet, but both teams are looking to get a deal over the line. If Spurs are the team to finally bring him to the Premier League, the Frenchman will have big shoes to fill in replacing Son.",
      "The iconic South Korean was signed from German side Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 and has gone on to score 173 goals in over 450 appearances for Spurs, eventually helping them win the Europa League last season.",
      "Speaking of his decision, Son said: \"Before we start, I just want to share the information that I have decided to leave this club this summer,\" Son said. \"Respectfully, this club is helping me to make my decision. I just want to share this before we start.",
      "\"It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career. I have spent 10 years at Tottenham. The main reason is I have achieved everything I can at Tottenham. I need a new environment for a fresh challenge. I’m grateful the club have respected my decision and wish Spurs well for the next season.\"",
      "Son refused to comment on his next destination. MLS side LAFC appear to be leading the race for his signature while there is also interest in the player from Saudi Arabia.",

      "Morgan Schneiderlin admitted his regret for ending his Manchester United career early, revealing he lost himself in his short stint at Old Trafford. The Frenchman spent seven years at Southampton and had established himself as one of the Premier League's best defensive midfielders during his time on the south coast.",
      "His impressive performances saw him sign for the Red Devils in a £24million transfer in 2015, with Louis van Gaal keen to solve his side's midfield issues. Schneiderlin started 25 league games and played in 39 matches across all competitions in his debut season but never quite met the expectations that were placed upon him.",
      "He would make only eight more appearances for the club before deciding that his time at Old Trafford was to come to an end. With Jose Mourinho replacing Van Gaal in the summer of 2016, the Frenchman was a bit-part player under the ex-Chelsea boss and requested to leave in the January transfer window of 2017.",
      "Looking back on his decision to end his Manchester adventure, Schneiderlin, whose old sides United and Everton clash in pre-season today, admitted he was too hasty to leave in order to reunite with his former Saints boss, Ronald Koeman, at Goodison Park.",
      "\"I learned a lot from my departure from Manchester United,\" the now 35-year-old told L’Equipe in 2022. \"I had played 40 matches the previous season with Manchester. When I come back from the Euros, I take ten days off and I play very little for three, four months.",
      "\"Then, I have Ronald Koeman and Everton who are pushing hard to get me, every day, from October. I will remember it all my life: I should have played against Liverpool, starter, and the coach (Mourinho) comes to see me.",
      "\"He tells me he doesn’t feel me inside the group. I tell him that indeed, with what has happened in the last three months, I am not in it and I want to go to Everton. I regretted it very quickly.",
      "\"Even if it went very well at Everton, when you play for Manchester United, when you’re at a club like that, it’s not for a moment of doubt that you have to question everything. Look at Ander Herrera: the first year I arrived, he was on the bench; he persevered, and today he is at PSG.\"",
      "While he did win the FA Cup in his debut campaign - which was the first honour of his career - Schneiderlin admitted he struggled executing Van Gaal's instructions on the pitch which left him feeling like he lost himself as a player.",
      "\"I was too affected by what Louis van Gaal was asking from me,\" he explained. \"I lost me as a player. It was not me on the field. It was not just the manager's fault; it was my fault, too. My role was not the one I had at Southampton. I felt restricted in my game. I felt they wanted to change things in me.",
      "\"I was not thinking as me, I was thinking about what pleased the coach. When you reach that point, every pass you make, everything you do, you don't play free. Something stopped me from being who I was. I wanted so much to do well, and it is one of the most frustrating things ever.\"",
      "Schneiderlin spent three years with Everton and left in 2020 to return to his native France with Nice. After departing in 2023, he enjoyed brief stints in Australia, Turkey and Greece before retiring from the sport last year.",

      "Manchester United have opened the door to selling Rasmus Hojlund this summer and have set an asking price of £30million for their striker. United are pursuing a new forward, with RB Leipzig's £70m-rated Benjamin Sesko their top target, although they face competition from Newcastle for his signature.",
      "Hojlund scored the opening goal in United's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday and said afterwards he is determined to stay and fight for his place next season. But if United are successful in signing Sesko or another forward, Hojlund, 22, will struggle for game time next season, particularly because Ruben Amorim's side are not in Europe next season.",
      "Hojlund could go the other way to Leipzig, as part of a player-plus-cash swap deal with Sesko, but the Denmark international is understood to not want to go to the Bundesliga club. Last season Hojlund, who joined United from Atalanta for £72m in 2023, scored 10 goals in all competitions and just four in the Premier League, underlining the need for a more prolific striker to lead their attack.",
      "United have already seen Newcastle have a bid turned down for target Sesko. The Magpies offered £65.5m and more than £4m of add-ons but the Bundesliga side will hope competition from Old Trafford can drive up the Slovenia star's value.",
      "Sesko, who scored 13 times last season, was left out of RB Leipzig's matchday squad for their friendly against Serie A side Atalanta on Saturday. The forward is under contract until 2029.",
      "United have already held talks with both player and club, and despite significant spending on the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer, the club can make the signing of a forward without first selling players. But Hojlund's future could become difficult if more competition arrivs.",
      "Asked if he had received any assurances from the club about his position earlier this week, Hojlund said: “Nothing so far.",
      "“I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens. I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "“I'm starting to develop and become even better at the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season, so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The Premier League champions have indicated they are prepared to park their interest in the Swedish international after seeing a £110million bid rejected by the Toon.",

The 25-year-old risks alienating the St James' Park fans despite reassurances from manager Eddie Howe that he still has the full support of the club.",

      "Manchester United will be eyeing a winning conclusion to their pre-season tour of the United States when they face Everton at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta tonight, kick-off 10pm BST.United have enjoyed a successful Premier League Summer Series campaign thus far, winning each of their opening two games. They beat West Ham United 2-1 last weekend before beating Bournemouth 4-1 in midweek.As a result, United just need to avoid a defeat against the Toffees to clinch the Summer Series trophy. David Moyes' side have lost their opening two games, conceding five goals.United head coach Ruben Amorim could hand summer signing Bryan Mbeumo his first appearance in United colours this evening after sitting out the opening two games of the tour due to a lack of match sharpness.Elsewhere, Matheus Cunha is expected to return after missing the win over Bournemouth at Soldier Field in Chicago due to fatigue.You can follow LIVE updates from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium via the blog below...",
      "After missing the midweek trumph over Bournemouth in Chicago due to fatigue, Matheus Cunha is poised to return for United this evening.",
      "He was excellent in the 2-1 win over West Ham United in New Jersey last weekend, offering plenty of promise from the left-sided No.10 position.",
      "Every United supporter watching the game tonight, either inside the Mercedes-Benz Stadium or on TV, will be hoping to see him and Bryan Mbeumo on the pitch together for the very first time.",
      "You can select the United XI you would like to see head coach Ruben Amorim deploy against Everton tonight via the interactive widget below:",
      "As much as United fans would love to see Bryan Mbeumo from the off, it's likely he will make his first appearance in United colours from the bench.",
      "Tom Heaton deserves to start over Altay Bayindir, with Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven making up the back three. Amad should start at right wing-back with Dorgu on the opposite side.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte looked excellent together in United's first pre-season tour outing and they should be given another chance in midfield.",
      "That means Bruno Fernandes can start further forward, with Matheus Cunha coming back into the team. Hojlund has enjoyed an encouraging tour of the US so far and he can lead the line.",
      "How United should line up vs Everton:",
      "Much of the transfer talk around Manchester United is centred around Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Reds are pursuing a deal for the 22-year-old RB Leipzig forward and there is a confidence that the Slovenia international could be on his way to Old Trafford. His potential arrival would almost definitely push Ruben Amorim’s summer spend beyond £200million as United attempt to rebuild after a disastrous 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Sesko would follow Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as big-money attacking additions and the trio would form a new-look United frontline.",
      "Whether Sesko - or another centre forward - arrives or not, United have already revamped the attack with their business to date and Sunday night’s friendly with Everton could offer the first glimpse of the future should Cunha and Mbeumo play together.",

      "Ruben Amorim has established new rules for Manchester United players to abide by this season.",
      "Amorim has settled on a softer form of discipline than permanent predecessor Erik ten Hag, though he has reiterated the importance of punctual timekeeping.",
      "Club sources say there are defined rules and codes of conduct now, with players encouraged to sign autographs and pose for photographs with supporters, though former executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward advocated such humility as far back as 2019.",
      "United have encountered issues with a number of high-profile players in recent years. Jadon Sancho confessed while he was at Borussia Dortmund he had to improve his timekeeping and it was also an issue at United.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not play during the 2022 pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia after he was late for a meeting and Marcus Rashford was dropped for the New Year's Eve fixture at Wolves later that year following his late arrival for a pre-match team meeting. Rashford came on at half-time to score the winning goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Rashford and Garnacho from the squad for the Manchester derby at City in December over their attitude in the 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen three days earlier. Rashford has not played for United since and Garnacho is expected to be sold before the end of the transfer window.",
      "After finishing 15th and trophyless last season, Amorim is striving to raise the standards at United and believes the clubs have improved their medical department and nutrition. He stressed that he will always be \"on top\" of the players and if they train poorly he will show them video evidence in front of their teammates.",
      "\"I think it's really important, especially when you are losing,\" Amorim said of the changes he has made. \"Sometimes you have that feeling that we are losing, let's change a little bit the standards just for them to be with me. I didn't feel that last season and they also saw that.",
      "\"So they understand that when I say one thing, I will do it. That is really important. And I think the change of culture is more a club thing than a manager thing. I cannot do everything by myself.",
      "\"But I think we improved in every department: medical department, nutrition, we have a new chef, we have new rules. We have rules, and the rules are not to treat the players as babies. They have sons. I treat them as a man, but they have rules now.",
      "\"And that can change the way you train. If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you. And I show you in front of everybody. So I'm always on top.",
      "\"I will expect to be in one phase, that I don't need to do anything. Because they will push each other. But in the moment, if you train one time bad, I will show you the image. I will not speak with you, just speak. I will show everything.",
      "\"So that really requires a lot of energy.\"",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Ruben Amorim said it was a \"pleasure\" to sit down with English journalists at the Chicago Fire's Endeavor Health Performance Center.",
      "This was his first pre-season sit down with us and in a chat with two broadcast journalists revealed he was targeting a 20-year stay as Manchester United manager.",
      "Amorim's first tour with the club has been buoyant: two games and two wins with six goals scored. There is a harmonious mood in the camp and the first word he used in our 18-minute chat was \"confident\".",
      "In the past, we have had 20-odd minutes with United managers. You do not need as long with Amorim, who was as quotable and charismatic as he was during his first six months in charge.",
      "Here is the full transcript of his sit-down with the written journalists:",
      "How are you feeling about this season, Ruben?",
      "Confident. When I see team training and team playing, my humour - you call it humour - it goes with the team. If I feel that everything is aligned, I feel more excited. If I feel more excited, I see more video, I see more football, I have more ideas. So I'm really confident in this moment.",
      "You look quite animated and excited. At times last season, you didn't look that way. Did you ever have any doubts about what you'd taken on at this club?",
      "It's not the case of not knowing what to do to change the club. I felt last season in some moments I just needed to survive to the end. Because everything I need to do, I will need to do with a new start, with more time, with some changes that I cannot do now. And that is even people around the staff and players. My goal in that moment, three months to the end, was trying to win the Europa League. We struggled a lot, trying to save players, to play 60 minutes. You play against Newcastle, all these clubs, and you have to perform. Or else we will have problems, but you need to take one guy 60 minutes. And you cannot do it in Manchester United. You cannot think like that. I cannot change three guys because I have to try to maintain the team fit to win the Europa League. I had that feeling during the season that I'm so frustrated, I cannot do nothing and I acknowledge that, so I have to wait. And to wait, and being manager of Manchester United, is like going to a fight with my hands like this (puts hands down his side). So that was the frustration.",
      "Did you have conversations with the club at that period? Reassurances from them? Because you're so much surviving, it felt maybe fragile at that point, that you might even think you had to walk away at that point.",
      "No, walk away is more an ego thing. I'm like that. If you saw Sporting: I won the league and we had the second place in the next year, in the third year, when we lost Matheus Nunes, Palhinha, and all these guys, we were fourth in the league, and I put my place in the... So it's a thing that my agent says, you don't need to sign a big contract. Because when things go bad, I put my place, because it's a, I don't know, maybe an ego thing. I'm maybe really romantic about things.",
      "I think people appreciate that emotional side to you, that you've got that connection with the club and with the fans. How do you translate that into making this a successful season? What kind of things are you doing on this pre-season tour?",
      "I think we need to be a little bit more emotional in this team. With the emotion, we become more sacrifice, more pace, more energy. And I think we are improving on that. I think competition is going to help. So if you see the teams like, if Cunha is playing, Mason is on the bench. Bruno and Kobbie are in the same position. Of course, Bruno can do different positions and even Kobbie. So these things are going to help us. And I think it's a perfect year to do that without European competition. So we need to put the standards, and then I think we'll be ready in the next season, in the other season, to cope with less trainings and all the culture is already here, so we can play, play, play.",
      "How important was the cultural change that you've implemented, Ruben? I mean, there's players that have either left the club or aren't here on this tour. When you came into the club, you obviously saw what you'd inherited. You've made changes, the players we talked to on tour said that you made it quite clear. You know, you're either with us or you're not with us. How important was it to make those changes and try and change the culture around this club?",
      "I think it's really important, especially when you are losing. Sometimes you have that feeling that we are losing, let's change a little bit the standards just for them to be with me. I didn't feel that last season and they also saw that. So they understand that when I say one thing, I will do it. That is really important. And I think the change of culture is more a club thing than a manager thing. I cannot do everything by myself. But I think we improved in every department. Medical department, nutrition, we have a new chef, we have new rules. We have rules, and the rules are not to treat the players as babies. They have sons. I treat them as a man, but they have rules now. And that can change the way you train. If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you. And I show you in front of everybody. So I'm always on top. I will expect to be in one phase, that I don't need to do anything. Because they will push each other. But in the moment, if you train one time bad, I will show you the image. I will not speak with you, just speak. I will show everything. So that really requires a lot of energy. But what I feel in this year is that I have more people to do that. And we have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys now. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with that. I said to them in this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.",
      "Who is in the leadership group?",
      "We have Bruno, we have Licha, we have Harry, we have Diogo, we have Tom and we have Nous. So it's not just the oldest one, Nous is in the group because he's a character that I like. And I try to understand the dynamic of the group. Try to reach every space. They are the guys that are responsible to keep everyone in line.",
      "You made a couple of big signings this summer. I know your focus is only on Manchester United and what you did. But you look at Liverpool who made significant signings, spent a lot of money. They were champions last season. Manchester City have done a similar thing. Is there a concern that you look at them and you think that gap is only just going to increase and whatever you do, it's not going to bring you closer to them?",
      "I think if we were in a different moment, I would be more concerned about that. We have so (many) big issues here that I'm so excited to change all these things that I'm not thinking in that way. If we had maybe a better season, we are looking at less problems. I would look at the opponents and say, I'm just focused on what we need to improve here. I'm really happy with the players that we bring. They proved in the Premier League, so I'm not concerned about the physical aspect. If they are fit to play in the Premier League, if they are struggling. I'm really happy with that. I'm really happy with the character. And I think it's a good thing. I think it personally, I think Jason and also Omar, that all the players that we want to bring to Manchester, any coach will want them. This is not my style. And I can guarantee you, if you bring any manager here, they will say, Bryan, thank you. Matheus Cunha, thank you. And then you have the potential of these kids that are really important for us. And when we have a really, really, really strong base, I think it's going to be the core business to bring these really potential guys to fill in the team because it's really hard to buy players.",
      "And as the target next season, Europe, we spoke to quite a few of the players who said that an immediate return to Europe has to be the priority. Whether that's top four or not.",
      "I know that is a massive gap. where we finish and Europa. But it's Manchester United. We need to return to Europe.",
      "You said you're happy with the squad and it's shaping up quite nicely. looking at the games, but obviously in goal and at the other end with the striker, there are areas of interest. Would you still hope or expect to have new personnel in those areas?",
      "To hope is a strong word. We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see. But I'm really happy. And I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers, even Tom is linear (think he means leaner), he's a different goalkeeper. Altay did really well and Onana is going to be better like the other guys that are getting better this year.",
      "Ruben, the club have had a lot of managers since Ferguson left. There have been a lot of plans and ambitions. And then the team's results get problematic and the ownership lose the nerve and they change the manager. A lot of fans are sick of seeing that and they accept that there might be some hard days to come, but they have to see this through. How confident are you that even if there are challenges this season, that Jim, Omar and Jason realise that the club can't keep doing what it's done before? They have to back you long term.",
      "I always felt that. In some moments in the last season, I was more concerned about me than them. They always show the support. And if you try to remember one team, one big team, massive team, that lost so many games and the manager kept their job, you will not find it. So that shows more than words that they support me. I think it's really important to say to the fans that this is a club thing. Of course the manager is really important, but all this idea of the culture, how we want to buy players, what kind of players we want, is a club thing. In the meetings with Bryan, with Cunha, we said that. Don't go to a club because of the manager. Go because of the idea of the club. And they are here because of the idea of the club.",
      "On Jim, he spoke very enthusiastically about you. He said, I like Ruben, he tells me to “f**k off”. Can you just talk about how often you speak? Do you message him a lot? You seem to have a very frank but playful and honest relationship.",
      "We speak on the phone, he sends me messages, he sends me gifs. You call it gifs? Joking. So we have this kind of relationship. I think it's really easy to deal with Jim. Easy in the sense that if you know your stuff, if you know how to explain any decision, you'll be fine with him. If you try to use some bullshit in big words with him, he's going to knock you. So for me it's really easy. I will say whatever I need to say with, of course, a lot of respect, like with everybody, I know that he's the owner of the club, I know my place. But when I need to say something, I will say it naturally. With no bulls**t - I can say that - with no bulls**t, I'm not around the subject, I'm really direct. I think it's something that he likes a lot.",
      "You seem as sure in your own mind about what you wanted to do as you ever did, you've been quite clear since you came to the club. What you wanted to do, that's never changed.",
      "Not because I believe, but I changed so many things during my short career as a manager. When I see a different thing that works, I will use it. I copy so many things about other managers, the way they play, warm-ups. I stole warm-ups. So I'm not so stubborn, but I truly believe that to be a really strong team, we need to have a base. When the base is okay, we will start doing different things. I truly believe in that, it's a process. I'm not the coach, I'm not the coach. And I said that in the interview. I'm not the coach that is going to try, in that case, to survive, to put an idea that is not mine. Since day one, it's the only way I know what to do. Let's build the base, are we going to suffer? Yes.",
      "When you talk about midfielders, lack of pace, is that a fitness thing? Or is that a personnel thing?",
      "Of course there are players that are not going to have a bigger pace. It's something that you cannot change. But if you look at the same players in these games, the pace is different. That is my feeling. I think it's the time to train. That I think is clear. I think even the certainty of the movements can help a player to be faster. If you are thinking, I jump, I don't jump. We train, when they need to jump, they already know. So I start sooner. Sometimes it's one meter. Sometimes it's one second. And that is something that the tactical aspect and the physical aspect are together.",
      "Like Mainoo with the interception for the pass of Bruno (against West Ham)?",
      "Mainoo, with those feet, playing the ball, if he finds the right pace, playing like every time I give the ball, I find a new solution. Every time the guy is running back, I can follow the guy because he can. He's going to be faster.",
      "You said you want to be here for the long term. You said 20 years. You know, we all know, the average lifespan of a manager is two or three years now. With the exception of Pep, Klopp, Fergie and Wenger before. What makes you confident that you can stay here long term?",
      "One of the things is the experience that I had. I know that it's different. But if you look, Sporting was the same thing. They said that in three months I'm out. They said that I had 3% (chance) of winning one title with Sporting. It was the same thing. I know that the pressure is different. But I truly believe in that and I don't like to change club. I like to bond with people and carry on. So, I took, I don't say five years because I was not thinking about leaving during the five years but the last years I was waiting for the right club. I know it sounds crazy. But I chose this club. But I had the feeling. So, I think I'm not going to have that feeling of I need to experience pain. I just want to bond, to be part of it. Until I can, I will stay here.",
      "Is there a chance we might see Mbeumo in a United shirt tomorrow for the first time?",
      "He's going to play (on Sunday).",
      "How excited are you about seeing him and see how he works with Cunha, Bruno or whoever he plays with?",
      "I'm really like you guys, not like you, but I'm really excited to see him playing. What he can give to our team. But I was really excited to see the team playing the last game. You maybe look at the starting XI and say, nothing to see today. And I was so excited because I know we can do better. So, I'm always excited, especially in this moment.",
      "Just finally, you've made some big decisions. With Alejandro, it seemed like there was a willingness from your side and his side to make it work. And you praised him a lot. You must feel it's a pity that it's not worked out?",
      "I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Read the full piece here",
      "Director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, worked alongside a young Sesko during his time at RB Salzburg and the Slovenia international clearly made an instant impression. In his analysis of the 22-year-old, Vivell claimed Sesko has all the attributes to become one of the world's leading players.",
      "\"Benjamin Sesko is among the game's top young talents - and has enormous potential to become a top player,\" Vivell said, per Bundesliga.com. He has all the qualities to do that. He's extremely quick, has a great jump on him and is strong in the air.",
      "\"Benjamin is a real goalscorer, who despite his 1.95m (6ft 4in height) is mobile and technically strong. His abilities make him a special player with a special profile.\"",
      "Former England international Stuart Pearce has heaped praise on Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona from Manchester United.",

      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season training last month as they even stripped him of his iconic No.10 shirt. However, he has now realised his dream move to Barcelona - after spending the latter part of the 2024/2025 season on loan at Aston Villa.",

      "“Now Palhinha is going to Tottenham on a loan deal with a €30m (£26m) buy option. Manchester United decided eventually to go for a different player. Less holding midfielder. Still defensive but more intensity. Let’s see what is going to happen.”",

      "\"And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.",
      "\"But I'm really happy. And I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers, even Tom is linear (think he means leaner), he's a different goalkeeper. Altay did really well and Onana is going to be better like the other guys that are getting better this year.\"",

      "He said during a sit-down interview with written journalists:",
      "\"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",
      "\"So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has revealed Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sends him gifs and that the pair get on as they converse with \"no bulls**t\".",
      "Amorim became the first United manager to be appointed after Ratcliffe secured a minority stake in the club last November but the club went on to endure their worst season in 51 years, finishing 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Ratcliffe said in March he has such candid conversations with Amorim that \"I tell him where it’s going wrong and he tells me to f**k off. I like him\".",
      "Amorim confirmed the pair enjoy a warm working relationship, so much so that Ratcliffe WhatsApps him gifs - graphic interchange formats - to lighten the mood.",
      "\"We speak on the phone,\" Amorim said. \"He sends me messages, he sends me gifs. You call it gifs? Joking! So we have this kind of relationship.",
      "\"I think it's really easy to deal with Jim. Easy in the sense that if you know your stuff, if you know how to explain any decision, you'll be fine with him. If you try to use some bulls**t in big words with him, he's going to knock you.",
      "\"So for me it's really easy. I will say whatever I need to say with, of course, a lot of respect, like with everybody, I know that he's the owner of the club, I know my place.",
      "\"But when I need to say something, I will say it naturally. With no bulls**t - I can say that - with no bulls**t. I'm not around the subject, I'm really direct. I think it's something that he likes a lot.\"",
      "United's backing for Amorim is so staunch it partly contributed to the defenestration of Dan Ashworth, who lasted as sporting director for a little over five months. Ashworth was opposed to the choice of Amorim as Erik ten Hag's replacement and favoured a British hire.",
      "Jason Wilcox, previously the technical director, has been promoted to director of football at United with Omar Berrada still the chief executive. Christopher Vivell is the club's director of recruitment and transfer strategy is no longer dictated by the manager, as was largely the case under Ten Hag.",
      "Amorim claimed the manager should not be the selling point for a new signing and that the \"idea of the club\" should convince potential recruits. The Portuguese suggested that any manager who replaces him should be grateful to inherit summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"In some moments in the last season, I was more concerned about me than them,\" Amorim added when asked about Ratcliffe, Berrada and Wilcox. \"They always show the support. And if you try to remember one team, one big team, massive team, that lost so many games and the manager kept their job, you will not find it.",
      "\"So that shows more than words that they support me. I think it's really important to say to the fans that this is a club thing. Of course, the manager is really important, but all this idea of the culture, how we want to buy players, what kind of players we want, is a club thing.",
      "\"In the meetings with Bryan, with Cunha, we said that. Don't go to a club because of the manager. Go because of the idea of the club. And they are here because of the idea of the club.",
      "\"I'm really happy with the players that we bring. They proved in the Premier League, so I'm not concerned about the physical aspect. If they are fit to play in the Premier League, if they are struggling. I'm really happy with that.",
      "\"I'm really happy with the character. And I think it's a good thing. I think it personally, I think Jason and also Omar, that all the players that we want to bring to Manchester, any coach will want them. This is not my style.",
      "\"And I can guarantee you, if you bring any manager here, they will say, Bryan, thank you. Matheus Cunha, thank you. And then you have the potential of these kids that are really important for us.",
      "\"And when we have a really, really, really strong base, I think it's going to be the core business to bring these really potential guys to fill in the team because it's really hard to buy players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim wants to remain in charge of Manchester United until he is 60.",
      "Amorim, who turned 40 in January, was appointed head coach in November and United went on to endure their worst season in 51 years.",
      "However, the club have enjoyed a buoyant pre-season and Amorim is \"confident\" about his first full campaign in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "\"When I see team training and team playing, my humour - you call it humour - it goes with the team,\" he explained. \"If I feel that everything is aligned, I feel more excited. If I feel more excited, I see more video, I see more football, I have more ideas. So I'm really confident in this moment.",
      "\"I want to stay. I want to stay 20 (years). That is my goal and I truly believe in that. Something will happen. Always do.",
      "\"In some moments I will be lucky. I had a lot of luck during my career as a manager and my idea is to stay for many years. But again we know that the results will dictate that. I know that last season I used all the credits but I'm ready to start fresh.",
      "\"I think this is not the moment that I felt more pressure in my life. I had my career as a player and I remember to finish my career really soon because of the injuries.",
      "\"I remember that me and my wife we have an Excel (spreadsheet) with all the money that we have, all the things that I need. I want to help my family. All this responsibility. And I felt the pressure in that time.",
      "\"Nowadays, I don't feel any pressure about that. I just don't. It's more like an ego thing. I want to be manager of Manchester United for a while. And I took five years to choose this club so I don't want to fail. That is the only pressure.",
      "\"The other pressure that is that pressure at the end of my career as a footballer was different. That was more difficult to deal with.\"",
      "Amorim gave careful consideration to which club he would leave Portuguese champions Sporting for. Liverpool assessed Amorim as a potential replacement for Jurgen Klopp and the Portuguese held discussions with West Ham United about taking over last summer.",
      "When United came calling in October, Amorim initially asked if he could see out the season in Lisbon. United issued a now-or-never ultimatum, with the minor compromise that Amorim could officially take over at the start of the November internationals.",
      "\"One of the things is the experience that I had,\" Amorim added. \"I know that it's different. But if you look, Sporting was the same thing. They said that in three months I'm out. They said that I had 3% (chance) of winning one title with Sporting. It was the same thing.",
      "\"I know that the pressure is different. But I truly believe on that and I don't like to change club. I like to bond with people and carry on. So, I took, I don't say five years because I was not thinking about leaving during the five years, but the last years I was waiting for the right club. I know it sounds crazy.",
      "\"But I chose this club. But I had the feeling. So, I think I'm not going to have that feeling of I need to experience pain. I just want to bond, to be part of it. Until I can, I will stay here.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted Manchester United's struggles last season were so severe he dreaded travelling to some games.",
      "Amorim officially took over as United head coach on November 11 and suffered 16 defeats in 42 games as the team finished 15th, United's lowest finish since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "United ended 2024-25 trophyless after they were beaten 1-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, an occasion that marked Spurs's first piece of silverware since 2008.",
      "Fifteen of the 16 losses under Amorim came in the Premier League as Amorim rotated to maintain freshness for United's European ties on Thursday nights. Amorim stressed at the time that managing a Thursday-Sunday schedule was \"hard\".",
      "United suffered four-goal defeats away to Newcastle United and Brentford after Europa League knockout games away to Lyon and Athletic Bilbao in the quarter and semi-finals. United went eight league fixtures without a win in April and May.",
      "Amorim billed his United side as \"maybe the worst in the history of the club\" as far back as January following a 3-1 home reverse to Brighton. After West Ham did the domestic double against United at Old Trafford in May, Amorim confessed he was \"embarrassed\" and that United were \"losing the feeling of we are a massive club\".",
      "When asked how he felt to go home to his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, and two young sons, after being beaten, Amorim said: \"To tell you the truth, it's not how I returned to my house after the games, [it's] how I left to go to the games. Because I felt that sometimes we will struggle.",
      "\"All the struggles that we had in the games, I feel it before the games. So that is the hardest part. To go to the games and know that we are not going to be competitive, how we should be. That is the hardest part.",
      "\"When I returned, I just looked to my family and tried to think of different things. But I was really frustrated.",
      "\"But if you want to know the most difficult moment, it was before the games. Because I knew that we will struggle in specific games.",
      "\"I felt last season in some moments I just needed to survive to the end. Because everything I need to do, I will need to do with a new start, with more time, with some changes that I cannot do now. And that is even people around the staff and players.",
      "\"My goal in that moment, three months to the end, was trying to win the Europa League. We struggled a lot, trying to save players, to play 60 minutes.",
      "\"You play against Newcastle, all these clubs, and you have to perform. Or else we will have problems, but you need to take one guy (off after) 60 minutes. And you cannot do it in Manchester United. You cannot think like that. I cannot change three guys because I have to try to maintain the team fit to win the Europa League.",
      "\"I had that feeling during the season that I'm so frustrated, I cannot do nothing and I acknowledge that, so I have to wait. And to wait, and being manager of Manchester United, is like going to a fight with my hands like this (puts hands down his side).",
      "\"So that was the frustration.\"",

    "body": [
      "After joining Barcelona on loan, Marcus Rashford remains tight-lipped about a potential permanent move from Manchester United. The forward has moved to Catalonia for the forthcoming season after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford's temporary switch to Barca provides the reigning champions of La Liga an opportunity to secure his services for £30million. This sum is significantly less than Rashford's value just a few seasons ago, before his standing took a hit at Old Trafford. The Spanish side are also covering his salary, saving United in the region of £12million over the course of the year.",
      "However, there are uncertainties surrounding Barcelona's financial health and whether Rashford will be registered in time for the season's kick-off. La Liga's financial fair play regulations have recently caused problems for the club, with the eligibility of Dani Olmo and Pau Victor being questioned last season.",
      "Spanish star Olmo even missed some game time last season while Barcelona sought approval over their salary cap issues. Yet when asked about any potential stumbling blocks, having already made a couple of pre-season appearances for his new team, Rashford responded nonchalantly.",
      "\"I'm not worried,\" he told Catalan newspaper Sport (via The Mirror), addressing his registration concerns. \"It's something the club needs to resolve, and I trust they will. I'm focused on training and being ready for the start of the competition.\"",
      "Rashford then clarified his stance on a permanent departure from United, emphasising he simply wants to \"enjoy the moment\" rather than think too far ahead. The 27-year-old made his Barcelona bow in a 3-1 friendly triumph against Japanese side Vissel Kobe at the end of July.",
      "Yet the cameo seemed to go awry. The England star entered as a substitute, only to be hauled off again after 30 minutes. The episode was portrayed as rather awkward for the player, who spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Nevertheless, new manager Hansi Flick was swift to reject any suggestions of embarrassment or shame. And he maintained the choice was purely to manage the player's fitness levels.",
      "\"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball,\" said the German after that match. \"He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford excelled on loan under Unai Emery and assisted Villa in making a historic run in the Champions League. He should be back among Europe's elite this coming season, though the same cannot be said for parent club United after they missed out on continental qualification altogether.",
      "It's also clear Rashford is prioritising his new team's requirements ahead of any personal ambitions. And he believes his capability to contribute from various areas of the pitch puts him in good stead.",
      "\"I can play in different positions and score goals from any of them,\" he said. \"It's about creating chances from different areas and taking advantage of them.\"",
      "Such an approach could well persuade Barcelona to secure his services on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, the United academy graduate faces a considerable journey to demonstrate that he merits the move, having copped criticism from pundits and United icons alike for not 'deserving' the transfer to Spain.",

      "Mikel Arteta's team eventually confirmed the Swedish striker's arrival last month following one of the summer's most protracted transfer sagas. The Gunners had narrowed their striker hunt down to Gyokeres and Sesko, but ultimately plumped for the 27-year-old, leaving Sesko embroiled in a tug-of-war between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "The Slovenian international had previously appeared destined for north London given the club's extensive 12-month scouting operation monitoring his development at RB Leipzig, according to ESPN.",
      "Following initial discussions with the German side, Arsenal executives quickly discovered that any move for the talented striker would prove too costly for a player still developing his game, reports the Mirror.",
      "The report highlighted three primary concerns that triggered \"alarm bells\" over a potential Sesko deal, including Leipzig's hefty asking price alongside his wage demands.",
      "With just two campaigns under his belt in Europe's elite leagues - netting 21 goals in all competitions during the previous term - sources revealed the club harboured doubts about Sesko's psychological readiness to spearhead Arsenal's frontline and cope with the accompanying pressure.",
      "Despite Gyokeres not yet making his mark in one of Europe's top domestic leagues, his impressive record of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP and Arsenal's faith in his character led them to secure a deal for the striker.",
      "Sesko is reportedly still weighing up his options, with Newcastle having their bid of just under £70m turned down after they rejected Liverpool's £110m offer for Alexander Isak. Despite United not yet making a formal offer for the 22-year-old, they remain keenly interested in enhancing their attack with his signature.",
      "However, Arsenal's decision to withdraw from a deal could raise eyebrows at United, who are all too familiar with the pitfalls of investing heavily in young strikers who fail to live up to their hefty price tags.",
      "The potential signing of Sesko might signal the end of Rasmus Hojlund's time at Old Trafford, as Ruben Amorim confessed he is uncertain whether the Dane - who has expressed his desire to fight for his place - will still be a United player by month's end.",
      "United shelled out £72m on the 22-year-old in 2023 and, according to The Athletic, acknowledge internally that they might now have to accept lower than his book value, which stands at a little under £45m.",
      "Following the striker's goal in United's 4-1 pre-season victory over Bournemouth, the Red Devils manager commented: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market.",
      "\"The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that's the most important thing. The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals.",
      "\"He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a a lot because of the lack of goals last season. But I think not just the goals, but the way Rasmus connects the play.",
      "\"Every time we have to kick the ball, we are kicking the ball when we are more pressed. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in the support is helping us to play a lot better and we are playing better because he's playing better.\"",
      "The arrival of Sesko would certainly come with the expectation that he provides consistent goals, especially after the dire season they had in front of goal. United netted just 44 league goals this past campaign, with only four teams scoring fewer, including all three of the relegated sides.",
      "Amorim has taken note of their troubles in front of goal, given the summer signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 35 combined league goals last season.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United are seeking certain \"characteristics\" from more signings before the transfer window closes.",
      "United are in discussions to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and are confident of negotiating a deal for a striker before selling any members of their 'bomb squad'.",
      "The club have been on the lookout for a new goalkeeper and approached Aston Villa about a possible loan move for Emiliano Martinez that was rejected.",
      "Andre Onana, United's incumbent number one, is close to returning to team training after sustaining a hamstring injury last month and could play in their final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina at Old Trafford next week.",
      "Amorim sounded content with the goalkeeping situation but indicated his eagerness to enhance the squad before the window shuts on September 1.",
      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim replied when asked if he hoped to have a new striker and a new 'keeper. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.",
      "\"But I'm really happy. And I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers. Even Tom (Heaton) is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper. Altay (Bayindir) did really well and Onana is going to be better like the other guys that are getting better this year.\"",
      "Amorim failed to give assurances that Rasmus Hojlund would stay at United in midweek. Inter Milan have enquired about Hojlund, who could be pushed out if a new centre forward arrives.",
      "Summer signing Bryan Mbeumo is set to make his first appearance for United against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. Mbeumo signed for United in a £71m deal from Brentford just under two weeks ago but did not figure in their opening pre-season tour wins against West Ham United and Bournemouth.",
      "United have prioritised Mbeumo's match fitness after Brentford's later start to pre-season and the winger's belated arrival to the United camp.",
      "\"He's going to play,\" Amorim confirmed. \"I'm really like you guys. I'm really excited to see him playing. What he can give to our team.",
      "\"But I was really excited to see the team playing the last game (against Bournemouth). You maybe look at the starting XI and say, 'nothing to see today'. And I was so excited because I know we can do better.",
      "\"So I'm always excited, especially in this moment.\"",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Whisper it quietly but Manchester United have looked quite good in their opening two games of their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "After a forgettable 0-0 draw against Leeds United in Stockholm a fortnight ago, the Reds have made significant strides since arriving in the US.",
      "As a result, United will be hoping to clinch the Premier League Summer Series trophy with a maximum points haul when they face Everton at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Sunday night.",
      "United made it two wins out of two with a comfortable 4-1 win over Bournemouth in midweek, getting the job done via goals from Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and substitute Ethan Williams.",
      "United played with a sense of purpose, producing a really encouraging performance. Although pre-season caveats have to be accounted for, their performance was energetic, vibrant and really encouraging.",
      "The tempo they set allowed them to move the ball with speed and a sense of conviction. One of the biggest criticisms they have faced in recent years has been for how uninspiring they have been to watch.",
      "Clearly adapting and becoming more and more familiar with Ruben Amorim's system, United's improved collective performances have raised the levels of several individuals. Patrick Dorgu, who arrived from Lecce in February, was particularly impressive against the Cherries, contributing a goal and an assist.",
      "With just two pre-season friendlies remaining, Amorim's team selections for the clashes with Everton and Fiorentina could provide a firm indication of the starting XI he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United have signed Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo so far this summer and are still hoping to bring in a goalkeeper, a midfielder and a striker, meaning Amorim's dream starting XI is still a few signings short of coming to fruition.",
      "Nevertheless, looking at the landscape of the squad as it is now, a crop of positions should be occupied by players the Portuguese chief already has available to him. Some positions have greater strength in depth than others, but that does not necessarily mean there isn't an obvious candidate to occupy top spot in the pecking order.",
      "Leny Yoro has been excellent in United's opening two games in the US, playing an excellent range of passes and demonstrating his hunger and ability to get on the ball and drive United up the pitch.",
      "The youngster is a shoo-in for the right-sided centre-back berth and will be one of the very first names on the teamsheet this season.",
      "In the wing-back department, Amad and Dorgu were both on target against Bournemouth. The latter has been superb in the opening two games of the tour and was involved in both of United's first half goals against the Cherries.",
      "Amorim wants his wing-backs to operate as wingers and occupy attacking positions. Dorgu did exactly that against Bournemouth and West Ham, pushing high up the pitch.",
      "Amad started as the right-sided No.10 against Bournemouth, but his starting position could change depending on what Amorim considers as Mbeumo's best position. The Cameroonian could feature for the first time this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was not on the scoresheet against Bournemouth, but his performance was just as influential. He regularly got on the ball in the centre of midfield and combined with Mason Mount and Amad in the No.10 berths.",
      "The Portuguese international is United's best player by some distance and will be a shoo-in for however long he remains at Old Trafford, meaning he could afford to have a dire pre-season and still make the team for the first competitive game of the season. His influence and importance is unrivalled.",
      "Fernandes linked up brilliantly with Cunha against West Ham and they will be hoping to develop a fruitful bond this season. The Brazilian has arrived from Wolves for £62.5million and has quickly demonstrated the sort of qualities he will bring to Old Trafford.",
      "His running power, technical ability and creativity levels inside the final third make him a guaranteed starter. He is also a natural fit for the left-sided No.10 spot.",
      "Mbeumo is yet to appear in pre-season so far, but the chances are he will join the list of undroppables once he's up to speed. The rest of the spots in the XI, however, are firmly up for grabs.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

We’re going to have our cake and eat it here; despite our frequent complaints about the modern trend for plain boring crew-neck collars on football shirts, there are still times when they are a solid and appropriate choice, and one of those is when you’ve already made the rest of the kit ostentatiously showy gold. This just isn’t a kit that needed a feature collar.",

And if anything even more so here where the use of black seems to lean even harder into traditional United areas.",

It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",

The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",

We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

      "11) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",

      "10) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "9) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",

      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

      "6) Sunderland\nThe last of the 20 teams to confirm their place in the top flight were also the second last to confirm their kit, and that was only due to contractual wrangles meaning Liverpool had no choice but to wait for August. But better to wait for a nice one than confirm a sh*t one, as we always say.",
      "Inevitably, the combination of red-and-white stripes plus hummel leads us down a vaguely Southampton route here, but while ‘is it obviously a Team X kit’ is one of our core criteria we are going to cut some slack here because we simply don’t think there’s any way around that particular puzzle without abandoning hummel altogether, and we’re very much in baby-with-the-bathwater territory there.",
      "Lovely simple kit, this, so much so that we don’t even mind the centred badge because everything is at least balanced. Collar is 10/10, the chevrons look as magnificent as ever, and quite simply hummel have done it again, as they nearly always do. Great bunch of lads.",

      "5) Nottingham Forest\nWe stuck this top five based on one leaked picture. The pinstripes as well as the shield surrounding the badge and the clear nods to the 92-94 kit were enough. But we still had that fear: what if we’d got this wrong and it was actually rubbish in the end?",
      "Luckily, it is not rubbish. It is lovely. And Morgan Gibbs-White will be wearing it after all. Everything’s coming up Forest (as long as you keep reminding yourself that preseason results absolutely do not and never have mattered).",

      "The striped collars and cuffs are first-rate, and the flashes of blue under the arms are just enough to avoid this falling into the Burnley trap.",
      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

      "2) Manchester United\nYour mileage may vary, but personally we’re fans of predominantly black trim on a Manchester United shirt, and that feels even more important this year with Liverpool also back in the adidas fold. You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "This shirt certainly has that, and perhaps our favourite collar of the entire season’s efforts. In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",
      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",
      "Hilarious japes aside, excellent shirt this. Unmistakably United, significantly different to – and we’re going to say better than – Liverpool’s own adidas effort.",

      "Sesko had been monitored by Arsenal before the north London side opted to pursue a move for Isak’s compatriot Viktor Gyokeres, who they signed last month in a deal worth €63.5million (£54.8m; $74.2m) plus €10m.",
      "Chelsea had also admired Sesko for several years, though they moved to sign forwards Liam Delap and Joao Pedro earlier this summer.",
      "Isak has been training at his former club, Real Sociedad, this week after pulling out of Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia due to a ‘thigh problem’.",

      "“From my situation I am very much removed from what was happening back home,” Howe said in a press conference.",
      "“I was made aware of a bid yesterday and that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. People back in England are dealing with the situation.",
      "“I really don’t know what happens next. From our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.",
      "“It is difficult because you don’t know what is going to happen. There can be all sorts of talk and hypothetical situations but then you are dealing with reality.",
      "“The reality is we had the first bid from Liverpool yesterday. I believe that was turned down, from this point onwards let’s see what happens.",
      "“I have no idea to try to predict that. In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Borussia Dortmund\nThe Gunners man is on Dortmund’s list of winger targets, with Jadon Sancho also under consideration. Arsenal could reinvest some of the money into Rodrygo, which means their supporters are bang up for this.",
      "",
      "19) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nFootball Insider’s Mick Brown is hearing things again, folks. Guehi to Liverpool could accelerate following Luis Diaz’s transfer to Bayern, apparently. The Crystal Palace captain’s “heart is set” on a move to Anfield, says the ex-Manchester United chief scout, who remains very well-connected within the game. FI’s words, not ours.",

      "",
      "18) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",
      "",
      "17) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "15) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "13) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Saudi\nJuventus have been linked more than any other European club in recent weeks, but a transfer to the Middle East seems much more likely. It just depends on whether Nunez is up for it or not. Liverpool will pray he is.",

      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t. United are now behind their league rivals in the race for Sesko.",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "7) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal is dropping down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",

The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",

      "The Premier League kicks off in two weeks. Some clubs are ready; others are miles off it. We’re ranking all 20 by how catastrophically screwed they are – from the ones cruising to the one contemplating its very existence.",
      "",
      "20) Liverpool\nNot f**ked in the slightest. The reigning champions have strengthened beyond belief in the summer transfer window, smashing their transfer record for 22-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold with Jeremie Frimpong, improving at left-back by signing Milos Kerkez, adding one of the Bundesliga’s best players in Hugo Ekitike, and likely signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle United.",
      "Even without Isak, Liverpool are ridiculously strong. Adding him would just take the p*ss quite frankly.",
      "Their ambitious summer transfer window has been enabled by the club’s shrewd transfer business in recent seasons. Before the 2025 summer window opened, they were tenth in the five-year Premier League net spend table. They’re currently seventh and buying Isak wouldn’t take them into the top four unless Arsenal sell Bukayo Saka for £200million before then.",
      "Arne Slot won the title after signing one player for 2024/25; Federico Chiesa started four times across all competitions and will leave after just one year at Anfield. You can’t blame the club’s hierarchy for not backing the manager heavily last summer, and having gathered the strongest evidence possible, they know they have an elite title-winning head coach and spending big on players he wants makes absolute sense. The Reds have played it to perfection.",
      "Manchester United should be taking notes after giving Erik ten Hag hundreds of millions in his first transfer window, and going all in on players for Ruben Amorim’s system, knowing that if it goes tits up, they’ll likely appoint a manager who doesn’t want half of the playing squad…again.",
      "TL;DR: Liverpool won the league comfortably and have strengthened like no champion has before. They are title favourites and signed all of their pre-planned transfer targets weeks before the Premier League season kicks off.",
      "MORE: Liverpool keep or sell: Eight Reds sold as Nunez, Elliott help fund record Isak transfer",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea\nThese guys are set…for the next five years. They can and should relax a bit, but we all know they won’t. They must fuel their transfer addiction. Chelsea have always been erratic and ambitious in the transfer window, but things have been cranked up a notch in the Clearlake era.",
      "Joao Pedro and Liam Delap are excellent striker additions, Jamie Gittens is a questionable one for £50m, but we’re not writing him off, Andrey Santos is Like A New Signing, and Estevao is a genuine wonderkid. We like this Chelsea squad and their title credentials.",
      "",
      "18) Arsenal\nNow that a striker is through the door, it has to be said that Arsenal are only an elite left-winger away from having the perfect squad. And that signing is more desirable than required, with Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard and Noni Madueke capable options on that side for now.",
      "Signing Viktor Gyokeres was the big one for the Gunners, with Martin Zubimendi’s addition in midfield also significant. It’s always been about the need for an out-and-out centre-forward, though. The big Swede made his debut against Spurs in Hong Kong on Thursday, but could not prevent a 1-0 defeat that we are not looking into too much, even if Mikel Arteta’s side were toothless in attack and many of the same issues from last season were on display. Not looking into it, though.",
      "All in all, the club’s transfer activity has been uncharacteristically ruthless, but still well planned out and meticulous. They took their time weighing up their options before picking Gyokeres over Benjamin Sesko, for instance.",
      "If this isn’t Arsenal’s year, then it’s never happening under Arteta, whether it’s in the Premier League or Champions League. Although Arsenal are where they are because of the Spaniard, it does feel like do or die for him. After so much money spent and five years of his #process, this club needs something tangible to show for their improvement, and it might take a proven winner in the dugout for that to happen.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City\nPep Guardiola got the majority of his transfer business done early this summer due to the club’s involvement in the Club World Cup. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki were all through the door in time to play in the United States, and Norwegian wonderkid Sverre Nypan and goalkeeper James Trafford have since signed.",
      "They are all set for another season under Guardiola and you wouldn’t put it past them steamrolling to the title, even if the two clubs who finished above them last term have improved.",
      "Rodri is back, but Kevin De Bruyne is gone, so it’s not easy to predict how City’s year will pan out.",
      "One potential issue is the lack of a right-back signing. Matheus Nunes can’t be the long-term option in that position. Then again, Guardiola is probably planning to make natural centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov the best right-back in the league, and there’s nothing anyone will be able to do about it.",
      "",
      "16) Brighton and Hove Albion\nFor me, Clive, Brighton had to get a new centre-back in early doors, and they did just that with Diego Coppola, who was among Europe’s top aerial duel winners last season.",
      "For good measure, they added Olivier Boscagli from PSV on a free transfer. He could end up being the bargain of the summer. Let’s not look past Maxim De Kuyper as well. He’s why Pervis Estupinan left without a fuss.",
      "They might have lost Joao Pedro, but £30m wonderkid Charalampos Kostoulas and Stefanos Tzimas have joined. Brighton won’t just be fine, they’ll be looking at the clubs above them who are stumbling through this transfer window, thinking there’s an opportunity.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester United\nSo, United look pretty decent. Their pre-season performances have been promising, and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are two excellent additions.",
      "This is a huge summer for the club, with Ruben Amorim’s players needing to adapt to his 3-4-2-1 system after over half a season of being unable to do so. This break – and reset – was needed.",
      "The Red Devils could obviously add more players to up the expectations even more, but we think the only position they *need* to improve is centre-forward.",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland\nWe’re big fans of the business conducted by newly-promoted Sunderland. Granit Xhaka, in particular, is a ridiculously good signing. He’s a Champions League midfielder, for crying out loud.",
      "The Black Cats have been ambitious, but so were Burnley, Ipswich and Luton Town over the last two seasons. It’s going to be tough, but this team is becoming well-equipped to survive.",
      "",
      "13) Nottingham Forest\nAfter signing a striker, replacing Anthony Elanga was Forest’s top priority, and they’ve done so excellently with the addition of Switzerland international Dan Ndoye.",
      "For Forest, keeping their best players was the most important thing, though bulking up the squad is necessary after Nuno Espirito Santo’s men ran out of steam in their Champions League pursuit last term. They successfully scared off Spurs and extended Morgan Gibbs-White’s contract, and haven’t been forced to deal with any serious interest in Murillo, Callum Hudson-Odoi or Elliot Anderson.",
      "Last season exceeded every Forest fan’s expectations, but we’re predicting another fun year, especially with a European campaign to look forward to. The City Ground under the lights on Thursday nights will be special.",
      "",
      "12) Tottenham Hotspur\nMohammed Kudus improves an area of the pitch Spurs needed to improve, and some of their depth issues were addressed in January, so the Europa League holders don’t need to do too much.",
      "Another midfielder is needed, and there are reports of Joao Palhinha coming in. He’d add something different to an energetic midfield, but after missing out on Gibbs-White, we wouldn’t be surprised to see Thomas Frank go for Harvey Elliott, or someone similar.",
      "And on Frank, that’s a top appointment. Getting the managerial situation sorted quickly was vitally important and Daniel Levy did exactly that.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nQuestion marks over Daniel Farke’s future were squashed before Leeds’ transfer business started, and their business has been impressive for the most part. Anton Stach is the standout signing, while Lucas Perri and Jaka Bijol are savvy additions for a newly-promoted side.",
      "It will be a long season for the Elland Road faithful, but there are ten clubs, six of which they’d fancy pulling into a relegation battle, who are in a worse position going into it.",
      "",
      "10) Burnley\nBurnley haven’t necessarily found themselves in a position where they are, per se, f**ked, but they’re hardly filling us with confidence. Kyle Walker is past it but remains a solid addition; we rate the Marcus Edwards deal, and think Sam Johnstone would be a good replacement for James Trafford.",
      "Whatever happens between now and the start of the season, just know that Scott Parker isn’t making it to Christmas. We don’t make the rules.",
      "",
      "9) Fulham\nMarco Silva’s only summer signing so far is back-up goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte. Not ideal, that. But maybe the Portuguese head coach is happy with his squad. Keeping Rodrigo Muniz seems to be Fulham’s top priority right now, but there’s a definite need for a new wide forward. Raheem Sterling has been mooted and we think it’s a great fit for the player and club; he wouldn’t even need to move house.",
      "This club needs a deep cup run or European push, and they’re going to need to get moving if either is to become a realistic objective.",
      "",
      "8) West Ham\nGraham Potter surely hoped for more of a rebuild at West Ham this summer. So far he’s lost Kudus, been forced to sign Jean-Clair Todibo permanently, added Kyle Walker-Peters on a free, and signed young wing-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.",
      "This is a team lacking top quality and athleticism in forward areas. There’s only so much Jarrod Bowen can do.",
      "One big positive is that Lucas Paqueta no longer has a potential ban hanging over his head, having been cleared of spot-fixing charges. Hopefully for the Irons, this will relieve pressure, tension and be a huge weight off the Brazilian’s shoulders, and they’ll enjoy watching him back to his best. There is talk of him leaving for as little as £25m, though, which might be off the table following the result of his case with the FA.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nThe Eagles’ pre-season preparation has been heavily impacted by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding their first-ever European campaign. It’s contributed to the club only making two signings – back-up goalkeeper Walter Benitez for nothing and left-back Borna Sosa for £2m.",
      "Oliver Glasner knows there has to be more transfer activity: “Even though all the players are still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far. I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year. As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day like last year, another false start is possible.”",
      "Openly discussing a broken promise with the board is an ominous sign. Of course, the board’s focus is elsewhere, but Glasner’s concentration is fully on getting his team prepared for the season, and that preparation isn’t going to plan. Yes, he’s still got Jean-Philippe Mateta, Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi – but for how long? Palace have reportedly turned down £30m from Atlanta United for Mateta, Arsenal are expected to sign Eze, and Guehi is a Liverpool target in the last year of his contract.",
      "Another key figure in their final 12 months is Glasner. The club are in discussions, but it’s hard to envision the Austrian head coach agreeing terms if those promises aren’t fulfilled. Palace going down isn’t realistic, but they are threatening to start 2025/26 very slowly. With a Thursday-Sunday schedule to contend with, they might not get up and running fast enough to make this upcoming campaign half as memorable as the last one.",
      "",
      "6) Bournemouth\nThis is not based entirely on losing 4-1 to Manchester United in pre-season, though we couldn’t be blamed if it was.",
      "We don’t think they’re in relegation trouble, but Bournemouth’s defence has been ripped apart, and they’ve only signed a left-back to replace Milos Kerkez. Dean Huijsen still hasn’t been replaced and Illia Zabarnyi is a top Paris Saint-Germain target. For months, we’ve been saying that the Cherries need a right-back with Adam Smith past his best and Julian Araujo struggling, but now that’s the least of their worries.",
      "Andoni Iraola has, at least, secured the signing of a new goalkeeper after being unable to make Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan permanent. Djordje Petrovic is an excellent signing and arguably better than Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, Robert Sanchez.",
      "Bournemouth are relaxed. Having made £90m alone from Huijsen and Kerkez, they’re under no pressure to sell Zabarnyi, but the Ukrainian wants to join PSG. He hasn’t stayed at home or gone to train at his old club to force the move, though. Fair play.",
      "The fact of the matter is, they aren’t close to signing a centre-back after failing to sign Lille’s Bafode Diakite, and they need two of them. It’s also been suggested that they want to sign a striker on loan with Enes Unal injured until November.",
      "There’s still plenty to do, but Bournemouth have extended Antoine Semenyo’s contract and are expected to keep hold of him, Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.",
      "",
      "5) Wolves\nThere is a serious threat of relegation looming at Molineux, and the fact that fans are furious over Nelson Semedo’s departure says a lot about the state the club is in. No offence, Nelson.",
      "There’s a concerning lack of quality throughout Vitor Pereira’s squad, and the man who carried Wolves through most of last season, Matheus Cunha, is long gone. Replaced by Fluminense’s Jhon Arias, Wolves should have plenty of money left over, having made over £60m from the Brazilian’s sale.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen joining permanently is a boost, and Arias could be as exciting and influential as Cunha, but this is another transfer window that the Midlands club are failing to take advantage of.",
      "It’s easier said than done to just replace Cunha with someone as good. Unfortunately, that’s not realistic, unless head coach Pereira can bring the absolute most out of someone unexpectedly. We just can’t see it, and the lack of invention in midfield, attack and full-back spells trouble. Oh, and they need a goalkeeper.",
      "Also, we can’t explain why, but Pereira stinks of an acrimonious November exit. We look forward to it.",
      "",
      "4) Everton\nDavid Moyes expected more from Everton’s summer transfer window, and he’s not a happy bunny. He’s being left short all over the pitch, with his side struggling in pre-season, drawing against Accrington Stanley and losing to Blackburn Rovers and Bournemouth.",
      "“The truth is we’re not getting them over the line at the moment – that’s a fact,” a frustrated Moyes said to reporters in the United States. “We’re not getting a lot of the deals done which we’re hoping to do, so we’re continually reassessing and moving on, while maybe things are not coming to fruition… We’re desperate to get things moving on because we know time’s running out.”",
      "Everton enjoyed themselves (for once) in the second half of last season and had reason for optimism in 2025/26, especially as they’re moving into a new stadium. With two weeks to go until they open their season with a trip to Leeds United, Moyes needs a winger, midfielder, right-back and centre-back. Not much, then.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nOne of the clubs most restricted by the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, Villa have been worryingly inactive in the summer transfer window.",
      "The addition of Yasin Ozcan is their only signing for a fee, and only Fulham (£437k) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less. There have been some striker rumours involving Samu Aghehowa and Lois Openda, but most of the club’s transfer stories are about sales, not signings.",
      "One sale could be Ollie Watkins, and there’s also a possibility that Morgan Rogers leaves, while Leon Bailey, Jacob Ramsey and Emiliano Martinez have been linked with exits.",
      "The position the Villans are in is very surprising. This time last year, they were looking forward to a Champions League campaign after unsettling the status quo with a fourth-place finish in the Premier League. Now, they are worried about being dismantled while their rivals strengthen at pace and they remain shackled.",
      "The need for attacking reinforcements was underlined by the loan signings of Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford and the permanent arrival of Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund in January. Asensio and Rashford were only on loan and contributed to 29.3% of Villa’s goals scored between February and the end of the season. They also had seven assists. Malen should have a bigger role next season after being cast aside following Rashford’s arrival, being left out of Unai Emery’s squad for the Champions League knockout rounds.",
      "Losing over a quarter of your goals must be addressed, and Villa’s lack of signings emphasises the need for a big sale. Rogers would be a gut-wrenching departure, but you have to break eggs to make an omelette. Getting clarity on players like Rogers, Watkins and Martinez is imperative, and it’s clear that Emery needs reinforcements all over the pitch.",
      "The one positive is that Boubacar Kamara has signed a new five-year contract. Positive Villa fans will tell you that’s more significant than any signing they make this summer.",
      "",
      "2) Brentford\nKeith Andrews’ Brentford are firmly in ‘We fear for them’ territory. The loss of Thomas Frank is gargantuan, and replacing him with a rookie head coach is extremely risky. Then you have the exits of club captain Christian Norgaard and star player Bryan Mbeumo, which was inevitable but still stings, and the Yoane Wissa debacle.",
      "Wissa reportedly feels betrayed by the club, who promised him a £26m transfer this summer if he stayed for 2024/25. He did, yet he’s not been allowed to join Newcastle following Mbeumo’s move to Manchester United.",
      "Too many key figures have departed for Brentford fans to be anything but sceptical of their survival chances this season. Relegation has not been a threat since their promotion in 2021, but with no Frank, Norgaard, Mbeumo and Wissa, it’s looking rather bleak.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United\nShambolic doesn’t begin to cover whatever is going on at Newcastle this summer. It’s baffling, disgraceful, and everything in between. Some things are out of their hands, but there’s no decisiveness in their transfer pursuits, which has seen several targets slip through their grasp like a lubed-up mini egg.",
      "The Magpies have botched pursuits of Joao Pedro, James Trafford, Hugo Ekitike, Liam Delap and could miss out on Benjamin Sesko because he’s “scared” he’ll be blocked from a future move. Losing out on the RB Leipzig striker to Manchester United will be the final straw for some fans.",
      "After winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, this was supposed to be a monumental summer for the club. Instead, it’s been a monumental disaster. And we haven’t even got into the Alexander Isak ordeal yet…",
      "There’s not much they can do, but the black and white wounds are already well-salted. The biggest question is: why now, Alex? The timing is baffling and the spotlight is on a club in disarray.",
      "Villa might be in a bit of bother, but we fear for Eddie Howe and his players in their first Premier League game of the season away to Emery’s side.",

Nine-figure sums are simply what’s required for world-class central midfielders these days.",

      "Manchester United ‘made an enquiry in recent days’ for Liverpool-linked Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, according to Florian Plettenberg.",
      "Liverpool failed with their opening offer of £110million for Isak, and reportedly won’t return with an improved offer due to Newcastle’s swift and strong response.",
      "The Magpies don’t want to sell the Swede, but it’s believed that a deal could be done for £150m.",
      "Isak is doing all he can to secure a move to Anfield. He’s not training in the north east after being left behind for the club’s pre-season tour of Asia, and is currently using the facilities of his old club, Real Sociedad.",
      "Despite his desire to leave and his recent behavior, Newcastle are willing to reintegrate the player and want him to sign a new contract.",
      "Isak will not be swayed by another Premier League team, having made it clear Liverpool is his dream destination, with the Reds willing to spend over £100m on him despite recently adding Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz for a combined £169m this summer.",
      "Interestingly, it’s been reported that Man United made an enquiry this week, but were ‘turned down’.",
      "This is according to Sky Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg, who says Isak remains optimistic that he will join Liverpool this summer, having agreed a six-year contract.",
      "Plettenberg wrote on X: ‘Understand Alexander #Isak has once again made it clear that he only wants to join Liverpool FC.",
      "‘Even Manchester United made an enquiry in recent days, but Isak turned it down. He only wants #LFC.",
      "‘The player’s camp remain optimistic that an agreement can be reached this transfer window, after a £120m bid was rejected by #NUFC. Isak’s agreement with LFC until 2031 is 100% done.’",
      "Ben Jacobs initially broke the news that Liverpool won’t make a second offer for Isak on Friday afternoon, and the transfer journalist has provided a few more updates since, explaining what could see the Reds return to the negotiating table.",
      "Reporting on X, Jacobs explained the state of play:",
      "– Liverpool say no second bid planned as it stands, as revealed.",
      "– Bid was £110m fixed, with no add-ons.",
      "– Personal terms with Isak not a problem.",
      "– Liverpool bid with optimism this morning, but Newcastle’s response was so quick and strong another bid is not currently in the works.",
      "– Key now is how Isak responds. Newcastle hoping he reintegrates and are prepared to offer him a new contract, likely with the ability to leave next summer.",
      "– Should Isak double down, and continue to push for a move, and Newcastle find striker replacements, Liverpool could revisit their stance, but only if #NUFC contact them to offer encouragement. Liverpool won’t bid again unless Newcastle indicate they will discuss a sale.",
      "Liverpool could ‘step up interest’ in Real Madrid winger Rodrygo if they can’t get a deal for Alexander Isak over the line, according to reports.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Liverpool ‘sent a clear message’ to Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak with four points earlier this week.",
      "Liverpool are the ‘horny bull’, not Newcastle. And their inability to pull Alexander Isak could be offset by a potential position change at centre-half.",
      "Liverpool are expected to come back with an improved offer for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, if the Magpies sign a replacement, according to reports.",
      "Sesko has been confirmed as Isak’s ‘replacement’ in a boost for Liverpool in their bid to land their dream striker this summer.",
      "Newcastle have reportedly offered Alexander Isak a new contract with a release clause as Eddie Howe says he has ‘no idea’ what the future holds for the striker."

      "The Magpies and Red Devils are both incredibly interested in signing the Slovenian international, with Leipzig reportedly asking for £65million guaranteed, plus add-ons and a percentage of a future sale.",
      "Newcastle quickly identified Sesko as their top choice to replace wantaway striker Alexander Isak, who is wanted by Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "United, meanwhile, want to recruit a new centre-forward after another difficult season for Rasmus Hojlund.",

      "It’s unlikely that the Geordies will sign Sesko if Isak isn’t sold, though Eddie Howe does want to sign another striker. Brentford’s Yoane Wissa is a target, but the Bees have told Newcastle he’ll cost at least £50m.",
      "If Newcastle are no longer in the race to sign the Leipzig youngster, then United will have a free run at him and will become the strong favourites to win the race for his signature.",
      "Even before it emerged that Liverpool won’t return with an improved offer for Isak, it was reported by United in Focus correspondent Graeme Bailey that there is an ‘internal confidence’ at Old Trafford that ‘they are set to win the chase for Sesko’.",
      "Indeed, Bailey claims that Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Red Devils are ‘very happy with how talks have gone in recent days’, though ‘they will not get ahead of themselves’.",
      "Bailey told United in Focus: “During their talks Sesko confirmed that a lack of Champions League football this season was not a problem to him as the long-term project and the chance to work with Ruben Amorim were the major draws.",
      "“I can also reveal that United made it clear to Sesko’s people that they are aware of the size of deal that would be required to land him and that they would not have entered into talks without that consideration.",
      "“United are confident, there is no denying that but they are waiting – they also know that Newcastle have put forward a very strong case.”",
      "Even without Champions League football, United are still able to lure the brightest of talents. Newcastle, meanwhile, are in disarray, but are willing to offer Isak a new contract.",
      "As well as negotiating for Sesko, United are working on player sales, with Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia all available.",
      "Man Utd will win the race for Newcastle target Benjamin Sesko if they make an acceptable bid for the RB Leipzig striker, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd are now “ready to bid” as soon as Benjamin Sesko “decides to join them”.",

      "Sesko has been confirmed as Isak’s ‘replacement’ in a boost for Liverpool in their bid to land their dream striker this summer.",

      "Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr have failed in an attempt to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Contact was made through intermediaries, but there was no formal approach to Man Utd from Al Nassr, whose captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portugal team-mate of Fernandes.",
      "The Man Utd midfielder rejected the chance to join Saudi Pro League rivals Al Hilal earlier this summer.",

      "But the 30-year-old turned down their offer as he did not want to move to Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.",
      "Manchester United do not want to sell their captain, who has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year.",
      "The Portugal international has contributed 98 goals and 87 assists in 290 games in all competitions since moving to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020.",
      "Fernandes has been in good form on Man Utd's pre-season tour of the USA, scoring both goals in the 2-1 win over West Ham.",
      "Fernandes confirmed in early June that he had rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and revealed how talks with his wife and Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim were key in his decision.",
      "Fernandes told a Portugal press conference: \"The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask about the possibility of me moving there.",
      "\"I had to wait a while to think about the future. As I've always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on.",
      "\"I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it.",
      "\"I spoke to the club, who said they weren't willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.",
      "\"From my side, it was a very ambitious proposal, the president was a fantastic person. I never talked about the money, it ended up coming up later, with my agent.",
      "\"I had to make the decision as a family and understand what I wanted for my future. That was the question my wife asked, what my professional goals would be. At no point did she say yes or no, she always supported me and put my professional side first.",
      "\"It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Ruben Neves, Joao Cancelo. My children are used to playing with theirs.",
      "\"But I simply want to stay at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, because I still feel capable of that.",
      "\"I want to continue to be happy and do what I love most. I'm still very passionate about this sport. It's my way of seeing football and I'm happy with my decision.\"",

      "There is no official bid from Man Utd yet. Their negotiations surround what they would be prepared to pay and how they would pay it. A decision on whether a formal bid goes in will be based on those talks.",
      "It was thought Man Utd would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",

In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right. I can't talk about other clubs, that is not for me to say.\"",

      "Newcastle have made a bid worth roughly £70m for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko while Manchester United are also keen; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 2 August 2025 14:19, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle have bid £70m and Manchester United are also considering a move.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",

      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United \"look like a different team\" after they earned their second victory in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United followed up their 2-1 win over West Ham by beating Bournemouth 4-1 on Thursday morning, even without new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "There are indications that the same players who struggled last season in the Premier League are now more comfortable in Amorim's shape.",
      "\"It was a good game. We played with intensity. We were aggressive and that is something that we need to improve from last season,\" said Amorim. \"We had better possession compared to the last game, so they are listening.",
      "\"Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the games can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions.",
      "\"It was a good test. We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson and Semenyo one against one. Luke Shaw was also really strong. So it was a good day.",
      "\"It was just a pre-season game but the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Amorim also indicated that United's improvement has come from a better culture as the club looks to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, having sent Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Amorim said: \"More than the results is the way they are playing. They are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"They are stronger. They are faster in this moment. Of course, it's pre-season, but you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see that the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"We are improving, but again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season, but it's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring for Man Utd amid the club's move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim believes United have improved because of the improvement in Hojlund's performances.",
      "\"People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,\" said Amorim. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long]. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.",
      "\"I'm really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola was also full of praise for United.",
      "\"We are very far right now from United,\" he said. \"They are a hell of a team. They have signed very well and today they showed they are above us in this moment.\"",
      "Amorim had insisted all along that perhaps the changes that he wanted to make at Old Trafford would be easier to implement during a summer and there were encouraging signs in Chicago that the worst of his time at United could now be behind him.",
      "There were plenty of positives in this performance against Bournemouth that went deeper than the result. In difficult conditions, United moved the ball impressively and played with real intensity and no little cohesion. In other words, it was different.",
      "There were interchanges between Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, the latter adding weight to the theory that Amorim's system will suit him in the long term. Patrick Dorgu, having shown himself to be a useful outlet last season, suggested he can build on that promise.",
      "This is pre-season and there are dangers in reading too much into it - particularly given that new signings Cunha and Mbeumo did not feature. But perhaps that is also a good sign. The same players looked a lot better. Light at the end of a long tunnel for Amorim.",

      "Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought, as it stands, Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.",
      "The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.",
      "United's interest in Sesko is long-standing, having kept an eye on his development for a number of years.",
      "While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.",
      "Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "However, the prices and structure for those players have been deemed too high at this stage.",

      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford? And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",

      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",

      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",

      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",

      "United have approached Villa about Watkins, who they have a long-standing interest in.",
      "However, Villa do not want to sell and he is thought to carry a value of around £60m.",
      "The interest in Sesko is understood to be driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who signed the striker as a 16-year-old for Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "Gary Neville has backed Ruben Amorim's overhaul of the Man Utd squad, including the summer signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is identifying players he does not want in the squad and moving them out. That's a positive,\" Neville told Sky News.",
      "\"The second thing is I do like are the signing of [Mathues] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got Premier League experience.",
      "\"They look more like Manchester United's style of players, with a bit more pace and power, and that physicality to get from box to box.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two is they've not proved themselves at the highest level in the game so they should be really desperate to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.",
      "\"The two signings are good signings yet there's a couple more needed. I think they need a goalkeeper. They need to sign a forward.",
      "\"They have to have a better season than last year. It can't get any worse really.\"",

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",
