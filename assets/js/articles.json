      "Paul Scholes insists it was a \"criminal offence\" for Manchester United to miss out on Gianluigi Donnarumma when it became apparent that his time at Paris Saint-Germain was over. There were calls for the club to go after a goalkeeper, but they missed out on signing the European champion.",
      "Donnarumma fell out of favour in Paris and he was looking for a way out this summer with the Red Devils linked with his services. Andre Onana had not convinced in his two years at Old Trafford and his error-strewn performances had raised red flags.",
      "The Italian was by far the best goalkeeper available during the transfer window and boasts a CV that includes victories in the Champions League and the Euros. But United didn't actively go after the ex-PSG shotstopper",
      "They instead turned their attention to young Belgian Senne Lammens, whom they signed on deadline day for £18million. That allowed Manchester City to pounce and they signed Donnarumma despite already bringing in James Trafford from Burnley earlier in the summer.",
      "Scholes remains stunned that his former side didn't make more effort to land the 26-year-old, insisting Onana's flaws were already well known prior to his latest blunder in the Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby, with City instead getting a major boost.",
      "He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club: \"Goalkeeper was [also] a major issue. Did they really need to get to the Grimsby game to realise [Andre] Onana is not good enough?",
      "\"If Manchester United were not in the market for Gianluigi Donnarumma when he became available, that is criminal offence. The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.”",
      "Donnarumma made his debut in the Manchester derby at the weekend and kept a clean sheet as City won comfortably 3-0. He produced a stellar save in the second-half to deny Bryan Mbeumo, underlining the value he will bring to Pep Guardiola's outfit.",
      "Ruben Amorim meanwhile has Lammens, Tom Heaton and current No 1 Altay Bayindir to pick from - but none of that trio have yet convinced or remain unknown quantities.",
      "The United boss admitted, after Onana was surprisingly allowed to leave on loan after deadline day, that it was time for a change in goal. He said: \"Sometimes things are not working in some environments, some moments. I think we, as a club, and Andre felt it was a moment to do a little change. We don't know the future, but it was time to change Onana.\"",

      "Their displays, meanwhile, have faced mounting scrutiny. Next up is a showdown with Chelsea, and barely a month into the campaign, United are already looking for a new spark to kick-start their season",
      "With that in mind, here is a look at the latest speculation surrounding the Portuguese manager's future at Old Trafford.",
      "After the loss to local rivals, City, Amorim maintained he would not alter his formation. \"It's not a record that you should have in Manchester United,\" he said in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. But I'm not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change.",
      "\"If not, you have to change the man. So, we'll talk about that every game, every game that we lose. 'I don't believe in that, in the system', or whatever. So, I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"My message is that I'm going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. And then, it's not my decision, the rest. So, until I'm here, I will do my best. I really want to win games, so I'm suffering more than them.\"",
      "Back in Portugal, Amorim is widely viewed as one of football's brightest coaching talents, having transformed Sporting Clube de Portugal's fortunes in Europe and broken their Liga Portugal title curse spanning nearly 20 years before taking over from Erik ten Hag at United. Now, Sporting's bitter rivals Benfica are said to be monitoring his predicament at Old Trafford closely.",
      "Benfica are preparing for presidential elections next month, with candidate Joao Noronha Lopes allegedly already including Amorim among his managerial targets. Portuguese publication A Bola suggests Lopes and former Portugal striker Nuno Gomes, who is standing for vice-president, attended the Etihad Stadium on Sunday with this in mind.",
      "The newspaper reports that Gomes faced questions about Amorim potentially becoming Benfica's next boss during campaigning in Evora, with the former international hinting it could happen. A Bola also reveals that Noronha Lopes has admitted preparing a deal for Manchester City ace Bernardo Silva as he bids to lure him back to Estadio da Luz.",
      "Noronha Lopes and Gomes faced questioning about the latest speculation upon their return to Lisbon. Noronha Lopes revealed: \"We went to Manchester to watch the derby, and when we are together, we take the time to have meetings and prepare the future of Benfica.",
      "\"We didn't meet up with Bernardo Silva or Ruben Amorim after the game. I want to bring to Benfica a winning culture, which has talent, dedication and people who know how to win.\"",
      "When pressed on whether he'd want to see Amorim as Benfica boss in the coming months, he responded: \"Ruben is under contract with Manchester United and I won't comment on that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Gomes rejected suggestions that their Manchester trip was connected to the United chief. \"I don't want to speak about that, I'm a friend of Ruben Amorim, and he has a contract with Manchester United,\" he said",
      "\"We watched the game, Joao [Noronha Lopes] is a passionate football fan and I enjoyed this experience with him.\"",
      "This wasn't his first encounter with Amorim questions. Last weekend, he declared: \"I can't answer that question at the moment but I'm sure that Amorim will be the manager of Benfica, one day.\"",
      "United legend turned pundit Gary Neville has confessed he's 'concerned' about the club's prospects over the coming weeks as mounting pressure builds on Amorim. \"Ruben Amorim is going to come under big pressure, he's going to come under big pressure, Manchester United are 14th in the league,\" he said. \"",
      "\"It's only a few games in, it's four games in, but next week, if Manchester United lose and they go and they go to 15th or 16th and it's five games in, before you know it we're in October and Manchester United are in the bottom half of the table and that's where they couldn't be, having spent £200 million, with him having a pre-season.",
      "\"They might be seventh, eighth, ninth, they could be in those types of positions, but they can't be in the bottom half of the table, so there's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players. I'm not saying here today that there's any suggestion that the players have downed tools on him, they've not, but they're struggling a little bit, they're struggling, they're struggling against Burnley at home, they're struggling against Fulham away in large parts, they're struggling at Grimsby, they struggled here today. They're struggling with it, they're struggling to find rhythm, to find tempo, to find performance levels.",
      "\"I was really heartened by the first game of the season against Arsenal. I thought it was a really good performance, but maybe that was that they'd had a good pre-season. Maybe now Cunha gets injured, Mount gets injured, the old wounds are starting to open up, and I'm worried. I'm worried about the manager, worried about what's going to happen in this next few weeks. I don't think it's a time for panic, but I've seen this before. We've seen this film.\"",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt insists Ruben Amorim will have to \"bite the bullet and change\" if he wants to be a success at Old Trafford. His ex-team-mate Paul Scholes is doubling down and claiming the system he plays is \"easy to work out\".",
      "The Portuguese boss oversaw another defeat at the weekend as Manchester City secured a dominant win in the Manchester derby. Much of the talk centres around the 3-4-3 formation that Amorim refuses to change, despite it bringing him little to shout about since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He previously enjoyed success with it at Sporting Lisbon and has frequently said the club will have to sack him if they want to play a different way. Amorim's philosophy has continued to be picked apart, owing in part to the personnel in midfield and the lack of natural wing-backs.",
      "The United boss rejected claims his two-man midfield was over run by City on Sunday, but Butt is adamant that the players he picks cannot get around the pitch effectively enough and a change is needed if he wants to start winning games.",
      "He told ‘The Good the Bad and the Football’ podcast: “Forget the system for a minute, the players are not at the level they need to be, not quick enough, not aggressive enough. The two lads in midfield, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte, they’ve not got the legs to do it in a three, let alone a two",
      "“If he wants to get results and keep his job in the long run, he is going to have to bite the bullet and change a bit – otherwise they’ll keep losing games.",
      "“You look at Pep Guardiola he’s got a philosophy that is the best anyone football has ever seen, even as a United fan. But even he changes. So he brought Jeremy Doku off the left and put him in the middle – because everyone knows how United will play.”",
      "Amorim's determination to stick by his principles mean United have shown little to no flexibility. Scholes has cited the ease with which that gives opponents to plan for them, given the Red Devils will continue to play in a similar way week to week.",
      "He said: “You talk about his philosophy, his style of play, the way he wants to play. There’s so many clever coaches in England and around the world, they work it out quite easily. They know exactly how United are going to play every week.",
      "“When the team sheet comes through an hour before the game you always wonder how your opponents are going to play, five at the back, four at the back? With Amorim, you know, everybody knows. It’s easy to play against and easy to work out as the coaches are that clever. Anyone in the Premier League can beat us.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand admits he is 'worried' about Benjamin Sesko's quiet start to life at Manchester United after watching the club's new striker feed off scraps during Sunday's Manchester derby.",
      "Sesko, 22, was the club's largest acquisition of the summer transfer window, joining in a deal worth £73.7million from RB Leipzig. But although the Slovenia international was brought in to spearhead a new-look attack for the Red Devils, United fans have hardly seen their new No 9, whose first Premier League start only came at the weekend. Unfortunately for United and Sesko, it wasn't a game to remember with the striker failing to have any chance of note in a game United lost 3-0.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team headed into the new season off the back of their worst ever Premier League campaign after struggling for goals. And while over £200m has been spent on the top area of the pitch to try and address the issue, Ferdinand is alarmed with how little Sesko had to work with in the derby.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the former United and England defender said: \"The one I'm worried about is Sesko. He ain't getting no chances man, he ain't getting no opportunities, there's nothing created for him.",
      "\"That's the concern. A new striker comes in the football club, gets in the team, you've got to think about creating chances for him. Getting him on the end of things. He's got to think about getting on the end of things.",
      "\"That's something I think has got to be looked at, and fixed quick. I don't want to think about what it could turn out to be.\"",
      "United struggled to muster much of an attacking threat until City killed the game off and switched to cruise control. The whole performance was tough viewing for Ferdinand, who was less than impressed with his old club's 'weak' display.",
      "\"It's depressing watching United like that,\" Ferdinand continued. \"The way we allowed them to get in and get goals and get opportunities - it was weak, it was powderpuff, it just lacked anything.",
      "\"I thought in the first-half, we pressed them quite well, and we had possession at times. [But then we] got in the final third, and there was zero creativity. Without Bruno [Fernandes], you're looking at it going, 'who else is going to create something - [Bryan] Mbeumo?' But there' s no real guile.\"",
      "United's return of four points from their opening four league games is their worst start to a season since the 1992-93 campaign. And going off what he's seen so far, Ferdinand concedes a top-six finish already looks unlikely.",
      "He added: \"If I sit here now and you ask me, 'where will Man United finish?', I would say probably sixth or seventh, I would be happy with it this season. That's looking like a long shot at this moment in time.\"",

      "United have four points from as many league games and a goal difference of minus three, which represents their worst start since 1992, when the Premier League was launched.",
      "Fallen giants United spent £236million on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Diego Leon and Senne Lammens, but have shown no signs of significant progress, culminating in Sunday's abject 3-0 derby defeat at local rivals Manchester City.",
      "Amorim's future hinges on United's next three games before the second international break of the season, with Scholes blaming the club's transfer strategy for the current crisis.",
      "\"I don't think the quality is there,\" said Scholes. \"Whatever two out of the four or five they have got in midfield - Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo - whatever combination he seems to try doesn't seem to work.",
      "\"That's a big issue. I thought all summer the absolute priority was a centre midfield player with legs, who can play and can control a game.",
      "\"Goalkeeper was a major issue. Did they really need to get to the Grimsby game to realise Andre Onana is not good enough? If Manchester United were not in the market for Gianluigi Donnarumma when he became available, that's a criminal offence.",
      "\"The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.",
      "“Mainoo came onto the scene a couple of years ago and I thought 'Wow, what a player!'. I know of late his legs have been questioned a little bit, but the game [United's 3-0 derby defeat to City] wasn't about legs. United had plenty of possession.",
      "“Fernandes can be fine in central midfield, as long as he's got hold of the ball. When you're playing against better teams, there are long spells when you're not going to have the ball.",
      "“That's when you have to know that position brilliantly, because there are clever managers about these days, every one of them, and Pep Guardiola is the very best at getting people in behind the [opposition] midfield. He had Phil Foden doing it, he had Bernardo Silva doing it, he had Jeremy Doku coming in off the side.",
      "“In that position – and I've been there myself, learning the position – you're constantly looking over your shoulder – 'where's Foden? Where's Doku? - and it's a horrible place to be at times.",
      "“If you're on the ball all the time, Fernandes is perfect, absolutely brilliant. Mainoo is the same, I think, on the ball, he can be fantastic, but he needs a proper partner next to him.”",
      "Scholes, who won 11 Premier League titles and the Champions League twice in a 20-year career with United, also said Amorim has to change from his rigid 3-4-3 system.",
      "\"He can't carry on playing this way, he just can't,\" Scholes told BBC Radio Five Live. \"At some point there has to be a moment where he thinks 'I have to change something because what I'm doing now is not working and I'm not getting results'. The proof is there.",
      "\"I like Amorim, with everything he says and he seems to be a likeable man. But unfortunately results paint a picture.",
      "\"At this moment in time it isn't good enough. At this moment in time if results don't improve, performances don't really matter that much. He has to win some games or the pressure is going to come on him massively.\"",

      "Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson once told former player Henning Berg to find a new club in a fit of fury. Ferguson, renowned for his fiery temperament as much as his incredible success at Old Trafford, gave Berg a dressing down he'd never forget, telling him: \"Don't even bother turning up again, find yourself a new club when you are away with your national team.\"",
      "Berg was part of the Red Devils' squad from 1997 to 2000 and experienced Ferguson's wrath during his final year at the club. This came after United, then reigning European champions, were ousted from the competition by Real Madrid.",
      "United had managed a 0-0 draw at the Santiago Bernabeau in the first leg, but lost the return tie 3-2. According to ex-United player and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ferguson blamed Berg for the role he played in United's defeat.",
      "\"The home game [against Madrid] was where Redondo did the backheel past Henning,\" Solskjaer said in the book. \"Henning wasn't a right-back but he was in the right-back position when that happened and this was his last full season at United. He had a tough time at that moment. Henning was a very good player and a good guy.",
      "\"He was 100 per cent, he didn't want headlines, but you could trust him, on and off the pitch. But the next season he came on at half-time at West Ham away when we were winning 2–0 but we drew 2–2 and got battered by the gaffer after that game.",
      "\"He said, 'Don't even bother turning up again, find your- self a new club when you are away with your national team.' I was watching that thinking, 'He doesn't really mean that, he's saying it in the heat of the moment,' which I think it was.",
      "\"The next day, Steve McClaren [then-United assistant manager] rang our home phone at my mum and dad's in Norway. I didn't have a mobile phone, I wasn't too bothered about people being able to get hold of me. Steve asked me to speak to Henning and say that the gaffer didn't mean it and to calm the situation, which I did. But Henning never played another game for United.\"",
      "Recounting his experience on the UTD podcast in 2022, Berg, now 56, gave an insight into how he found himself on the receiving end of Ferguson's infamous 'hairdryer' treatment.",
      "\"We played West Ham away. I think I came on at half-time,\" Berg said. \"Then, Joe Cole was a young up-and-coming star. We hadn't seen too much of him. He was too good, technically, and I made a [foul for a] penalty, so West Ham got a goal from the penalty. Then I think Paolo Di Canio crossed it for them to score the equaliser.",
      "\"I cut out the pass on the inside, and then he faked, as he always did, then he turned and cut it back, and I got blamed for that as well [laughs]. He [Ferguson] was a little bit angry after the game – this is true.\"",
      "Despite Berg's departure shortly afterwards, he disclosed that Sir Alex never expressed regret for his fiery outburst. \"We did speak about it the week after,\" Berg added.",
      "\"He called me into the office and said, 'Listen, I know what I said'. And he explained why he said these things, but he also said, 'Maybe it was also this and this...' which was... okay. But he didn't excuse himself for what he said. Because that's how he is, and he should never do that anyway. So I think he handled it in a good way.\"",
      "Berg clinched two Premier League titles with United and was part of the legendary treble-winning team of 1999. He later returned to Blackburn Rovers before ending his career at Rangers in 2004.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's dismal run continues after defeat to Manchester City on derby day. And Ruben Amorim has been told that he and some of his players simply can't cut it.",
      "Pep Guardiola's City put their rivals to the sword 3-0 on Sunday thanks to a Phil Foden header and an Erling Haaland double. The Red Devils have now only won one game this season and sit 14th in the Premier League as pressure continues to mount on head coach Amorim.",
      "In United's defeat, Uruguayan midfielder Manuel Ugarte failed to make any impact and was substituted after 80 minutes with his side's fate sealed. The 24-year-old arrived from PSG last summer for a fee that could rise to £50million with add-ons included.",
      "Speaking after the loss, Neville took aim at United's midfielders and claimed that Ugarte, in particular, is not good enough to play for the club despite his sizable transfer sum.",
      "\"The midfield is a massive problem, and we've known that. United fans know that,\" said the ex-Red Devils right-back, speaking on his Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"Ugarte and Fernandes today, I think you mentioned it early, about an hour before the game, that Ugarte and Fernandes played in this fixture last year from start to finish, and United won the game, but Ugarte is not good enough.\"",
      "In his post-match press conference, Amorim was rather bullish when asked why he has yet to adapt his playing style despite the club's evidently lacking results. Comments made by ex-United boss Mourinho earlier this summer have now resurfaced, with the Portuguese manager blasting any other head coach who refuses to change.",
      "\"There are coaches who try things that don't work and fail, but they say, 'I died with my idea.' If you die with your idea, you're stupid. Coaches have to adapt their ideas to what they have,\" said Mourinho.",
      "Amorim's press conference admission perhaps falls under Mourinho's viral comment, as he said: \"I won't change my philosophy. If they (the United hierarchy) want it changed, you change the man. I am not going to change my philosophy. I will play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"Guys, I understand [the questions] and I accept it is not a record you should have at Man United. But there are a lot of things that you have no idea about what happen in the last months.\"",
      "\"United are throwing money and if these are brilliant coaches, you are going, 'When are you going to coach these players to make them better?' Because some of the decision-making, it's just all wrong,\" stated Keane.",
      "\"Shaw for the first goal, so Shaw is an international footballer. For him to get caught out like that. I think Shaw has been getting away with murder for years at United. Always injured, never quite fit.",
      "\"We make excuses and then he gets a few games under his belt and then he's making decisions like he doesn't even want to tackle people.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Owen Hargreaves has claimed that Wayne Rooney was one of the hardest workers he's ever played with. The ex-England star's comments fly in the face of the remarks made by NFL legend Tom Brady, who recently criticised Rooney's work ethic.",
      "Rooney was given the boot by Birmingham City, where Brady is a part-owner, after just 83 disastrous days in charge in January 2024. The seven-time Super Bowl champion questioned Rooney's application to his position as manager in a documentary that followed Brady's involvement with Birmingham.",
      "Following a visit to the club's training ground in November 2023, Brady let slip that he was \"a little worried about our head coach's work ethic\". While Rooney has responded to the comments himself, he has been backed by Hargreaves, who played with Rooney at United from 2007-2011.",
      "Speaking on That Peter Crouch podcast, the ex-Bayern Munich star was asked who was better in training out of Cristiano Ronaldo and Rooney, with the Liverpudlian remarkably just edging it over the player who's regarded as one of the greatest of all time.",
      "\"What a great question,\" Hargreaves began. \"I'm sure Cristiano would disagree but Wazza [Rooney] was insane. Peak Wazza. Prime Wazza was like a hybrid, he was crazy.\"",
      "Addressing Brady's claims in August, on his self-titled podcast, Rooney slammed the comments as \"unfair. He said \"I think Tom came in once, which was the day before a game where the days are a little bit lighter anyway, and I don't think he really understood football that well.",
      "\"But what he does understand is, he's a hard worker, we know that. Football is not NFL – NFL works for three months a year. Players do need rest as well, so I think he's very unfair, the way he's come out and portrayed that.\"",
      "Knighthead Capital Management LLC launched a takeover of Birmingham back in June 2023. Brady joined two months later, and just four months on, the new ownership replaced manager John Eustace with Rooney.",
      "However, Rooney's spell was ill-fated to say the least. He lasted just 15 matches before being sacked with the team 20th in the table.",
      "\"When I went into Birmingham, they were in a mess really,\" said Rooney on his stint. \"Hence the fact that the players weren't really the players who could take the club forward.\"",
      "Four managers, including Tony Mowbray, stepped in with little success before Chris Davies was later installed as head coach. The Blues finished top of League One in 2024-25 under Davies, earning promotion to the Championship.",
      "Despite the former New England Patriots star's harsh critique, Rooney chose to remain diplomatic rather than hit back at the star.",
      "\"Listen, I respect Tom Brady massively,\" said Rooney. \"He's one of the greatest, if not the greatest athletes of all time and Birmingham do look like they're getting it right now, which is good and I think what they have done is got the players out that they needed to get out.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has backed fellow Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford after both players enjoyed triumphant weekends away from their parent club. A day before the United lost the Manchester Derby, Hojlund netted 14 minutes into his Napoli debut after beating long-serving former United goalkeeper David de Gea.",
      "Then, hours after United suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City, Rashford featured for Barcelona in their 6-0 thrashing of Valencia, setting up the second goal. That assist marked his first for the club in a competitive fixture after he became the first member of the United 'bomb squad' to leave earlier in the summer.",
      "Hojlund, whose side beat Fiorentina 3-1, was amongst several United players - past and present - who liked the social media post. United captain Bruno Fernandes and Tyrell Malacia were among the current squad to do so.",
      "Other out-on-loan players Ethan Wheatley and Joe Hugill, who are due to spend this season with Northampton Town and Barnet respectively, also did so. Also showing support were Aaron Wan-Bissaka, De Gea, Donny van de Beek, Jesse Lingard and Shola Shoretire.",
      "Several of those also interacted with a post from Hojlund after his debut. \"First day at the new job didn't disappoint,\" the caption reads. \"Love it mate,\" chimed in Harry Maguire, while Antony responded with a flurry of applause emojis.",
      "The post was also liked by a host of other football stars including Ayden Heaven, Bryan Mbeumo, Diogo Dalot, Fernandes, Godwill Kukonki, Hugill, Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo, Leny Yoro, Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha, Matthijs de Ligt, Patrick Dorgu, Rashford, Rhys Bennett and Wheatley.",
      "Ex-players Christian Eriksen, Mason Greenwood, Sofyan Amrabat, Wan-Bissaka and Willy Kambwala also gave the post a thumbs up. Hojlund is set to return to Manchester this week as City prepare to host Napoli in their first Champions League match on Thursday.",
      "With United enduring their worst start to a season since 1992/93, and with pressure ramping up on Ruben Amorim, Hojlund may well be happy that - like Rashford - he left United in the summer.",
      "Napoli manager Antonio Conte was clearly delighted with Hojlund's impact on debut - and poked fun at United in his post-match press conference. \"Hojlund is only 22. We signed him from Manchester United after seeing the luck [Scott] McTominay brought us,\" Conte joked.",

The Red Devils also crashed out of the Carabao Cup in an embarrassing fashion - losing 12-11 on penalties to League Two outfit Grimsby Town after a 2-2 stalemate in normal time.",
      "This follows United securing their joint-worst Premier League campaign (15th place) with their lowest-ever points haul (42) and most losses (15) since the league's inception 33 years ago.",
      "Since taking over from Erik ten Hag as United's manager - in November 2023 - Amorim's tenure has been deeply disappointing. The Portuguese has triumphed in merely eight of his 31 league encounters at the helm.",
      "However, a source close to Amorim concedes that it's incredible that his role isn't facing serious scrutiny. Hamann, on the other hand, reckons that United's patience with Amorim could run out if there isn't a swift upturn in results.",
      "In fact, Hamann has suggested that the ex-Sporting CP boss could be shown the door by Christmas, if he doesn't manage to reverse United's current slump. Speaking to Racing Tipster, Hamman stated: \"I think Ruben Amorim has got to turn things around quickly.",

The Red Devils were comprehensively outclassed at the Etihad Stadium, with Phil Foden opening the scoring, before Erling Haaland's second-half double rubbed salt into the wounds.",
      "The result leaves United with merely one victory from their opening five fixtures across all competitions. Amorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag 10 months ago, has won just eight of his 31 Premier League outings at the helm - which gives him a dismal 26 per cent win rate.",

In Portugal, he was wedded to that three-at-the-back formation and it remains that way at Old Trafford - but to very different results.",

With four points from their opening four fixtures this season, United have endured their most dismal start to a Premier League campaign since 1992/93.",

Talk surrounding Amorim's future is intensifying and former City right-back Richards has provided the Portuguese boss with some crucial guidance to remedy United's troubles.",
      "\"From the studio, you have a bird's-eye view so you can see all the positions and, in the first minute, Haaland gets his chance. United grew into the game a little bit. A little bit of confidence.",
      "\"I remember saying after the United vs Arsenal game; 'I can see an improvement'. I actually thought, in aspects of the City game, Man Utd did good things. But what is crystal clear, in the middle of the park, they need more legs. I can see that, all the fans can see that, but the manager is sticking to his guns and I just don't understand it.",

You got Rodri, who actually in the first half, I didn't think he played too well, he gave the ball away too easily, but you have got legs with [Tijani] Reijnders and you got Foden playing off Haaland.

      "Ruben Amorim is fighting to retain the confidence of his Manchester United players following their derby debacle.",
      "United's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City piled the pressure on Amorim, with the Portuguese head coach fighting to save his job. It is understood some of United's senior players have been left frustrated and confused by Amorim's refusal to change his tactics and system.",
      "Amorim's rigid 3-4-3 formation and his refusal to adapt to any other set-up is said to have caused huge concern among key members of the squad. Some United players are said to feel Amorim is undermining them by repeatedly asking them to fit into a system they are not equipped to play.",
      "Pressure is mounting on Amorim to turn United around after their poor start to the season, which has seen them take four points from as many games. United sources insist \"nothing has changed\" in terms of their support for Amorim and that he retains the full backing of the club hierarchy.",
      "But United supporters were left stunned by their side's meek capitulation at the Etihad Stadium, with many feeling they got away lightly by only losing 3-0.",
      "United have won just one game this season – needing a 97th-minute penalty to beat newly-promoted Burnley – and crashed out of the EFL Cup to League Two Grimsby. After United finished 15th last season, their lowest place for half a century, Amorim needed a strong start to the new season but has failed miserably.",
      "He has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games in charge, while United's four point haul is their worst start to a season since 1992. Amorim has been backed in the transfer market this summer, with United spending almost £236million on strengthening his squad.",
      "But the new additions of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens have so far not had the expected impact, while Amorim is refusing to compromise on his style of play and formation.",
      "United legend Wayne Rooney claimed the team have got worse since Amorim replaced the Erik ten Hag 10 months ago. “It's hard to see how it continues,” Rooney told BBC Sport. “I don’t think anyone can understand and comprehend what's going on. Frankly, it's not good enough.",
      "\"I want to be as supportive and positive as I can be on the manager and the players. But it's very difficult to sit here and say we're seeing progression and at least we're seeing things that will get results in the near future.",

      "Manchester United are three times more likely to be relegated than they are to qualify for the Europa League - according to a supercomputer. The Red Devils have endured a horror start and four games in have been given a lofty 10.95 per cent chance of going down.",
      "Following defeat in the Manchester derby Ruben Amorim's side lie in 14th with four points from their first four games - their lowest total since 1992/93. It follows on from their worst ever Premier League season, which saw them finish 15th, and now even further depths are being discussed.",
      "Once a team who won league titles annually, over the past decade top-four has been the remit. But the stats at Opta have suggested that United has a 4.18 per cent chance for landing a Champions League spot and just a 0.18 per cent chance of winning the Premier League.",
      "Relegation would be scarcely believable for those at Old Trafford, especially after they yet again spent more than £200million this summer on the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. But those behind all the stats insist of all the major outcomes that could happen on the red side of Manchester relegation is more than twice as likely than any qualification for European football - which is a damning reflection of the club at present.",
      "Amorim is nearing his year anniversary in the job and he has shown no sign of taking the club forward. Even in his opening few months in charge, after a December that saw United lose five times, he was forced to admit that the Red Devils were in the midst of a relegation scrap.",
      "After a loss to Newcastle last term he confessed: \"That is really clear [United are being dragged into a relegation battle] so we have to fight. It is a really difficult moment for us, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty.\"",
      "United will not be addressing any potential relegation fears four games into the season, even if their only win of the season came courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes penalty in stoppage time against Burnley. The loss to Manchester City gives Amorim's record more of a grim reading - and he admits it is not good enough.",
      "\"I won't change my philosophy,\" said the Portuguese coach. \"If they [United hierarchy] want it changed, you change the man. I am not going to change my philosophy. I will play my way until I want to change. Guys, I understand [the questions] and I accept it is not a record you should have at Man United. But there are a lot of things that you have no idea about what happen in the last months.",

      "It was a scene reminiscent from Manchester derbies past. Phil Foden and Erling Haaland have so often been Manchester United's tormentors-in-chief on derby day, and they proved to be so yet again on Sunday as Manchester City swatted their rivals aside without ever really hitting top gear.",
      "Haaland has been an imperious force ever since he arrived on these shores in the summer of 2022, plundering goals at a remarkable rate. But even the Norwegian's outrageous returns have not been enough to maintain City's invincibility over the past 12 months, with Pep Guardiola's formerly unformidable side now mortal.",
      "City's malaise has coincided with a difficult period for Foden, the most influential figure in their title triumph in the 2023-24 campaign. The attacking midfielder was back in full flow, though, in a fixture he has revelled in down the years.",
      "And his seventh goal against Manchester United in as many games could turn out to be the most substantial yet if it acts as the prelude to a renaissance for the Manchester City academy graduate.",
      "If anyone knows that, it's Haaland. It was just 18 months ago that Foden was coronated as the Premier League's Player of the Season after driving City to a history-making fourth consecutive domestic crown. He struck up a formidable partnership with Haaland, who crowed about City's homegrown superstar after the derby. \"We need him so much,\" the striker stressed.",
      "The Foden we saw on Sunday was reminiscent of the diminutive magician that left the Premier League spellbound during City's march to four-in-a-row. When Foden is in full flight, few can match him. Even fewer can stop him, which is something Manchester United know only too well.",
      "Much has been made of how Liverpool and Arsenal have strengthened this summer while talk of City mounting a serious challenge to reclaim their crown has been subdued. But do any of their new recruits rival Foden in his pomp? If Haaland and City can continue to support Foden and coax more magic out of those boots then there's an argument that a revitalised Foden would surpass them all.",
      "“We cannot forget two seasons ago when we won the last game against West Ham. He was the key player to win the Premier League,” was the reminder from Guardiola as he waxed lyrical about Foden on Sunday.",
      "Injuries prevented him from stepping up to the mantle as City's new kingpin last season with Kevin de Bruyne abdicating the throne long before his exit was finally signed off.",
      "Foden has long been considered the natural heir to the Belgian maestro. And if that does come to pass in the coming months, then it will be far more significant than any signing Manchester City could make.",

      "Gary Lineker has expressed his concern over the treatment of Kobbie Mainoo at Manchester United - admitting he's \"baffled\" by the youngster's lack of playing time under Ruben Amorim. Despite impressing in his brief cameo during Sunday's defeat to Manchester City, Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League match so far this season and was once again named on the bench for the clash.",
      "The England international made an impact when he was brought on in the 62nd minute, recording a 100 per cent pass success rate from his 17 attempts. He also won all three of his duels and made one successful dribble.",
      "Following his performance, some United supporters have urged Amorim to give Mainoo a starting berth against Chelsea on Saturday as they seek out only their second victory of the campaign. The Stockport-born prodigy has played just 73 minutes of top-flight football this term, having been an unused sub against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Ex-Leicester City and Tottenham star Lineker has now shared his thoughts on Mainoo's predicament, expressing worry about his inability to break into the United first-team. Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Lineker voiced his concerns: \"It really worries me the way Kobbie Mainoo has been kind of almost dismissed, he's such an incredible young talent, local boy as well doing really well.",
      "\"I mean, I thought when he came on, he did really quite well. I don't get it. I don't know whether there's something that we don't know about or something like that, but it's slightly baffling to me.\"",
      "United were soundly defeated at the Etihad Stadium, with Erling Haaland netting twice in the second half to seal the victory for City. That came after Phil Foden's 18th-minute opener.",
      "\"They just looked so poor,\" Lineker added on United. \"One thing I would say, and in a way he knows how he wants his team to play, he might not have the players, but the one thing I would say, if you constantly tell everybody you're going to continue playing the same way, does that not make your team very easy to plan against? So, City outnumbered them in midfield. They had too many bodies for them. They couldn't cope.\"",

Although United insist Amorim retains the backing of the club hierarchy, the team's next three games, against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland, will ultimately decide his fate.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, former England manager Gareth Southgate and USA head coach Mauricio Pochettino are among the candidates to succeed Amorim, should he go. United legend Rooney painted a bleak picture for Amorim in the wake of Sunday's derby debacle and suggested there was little evidence of the Portuguese head coach salvaging the situation.",

      "\"But it's very difficult to sit here and say we're seeing progression and at least we're seeing things that will get results in the near future. We're seeing none of that and it's very difficult. There was an image towards the end of the game where I saw the Manchester United fans leaving.",

      "If there is a team that can turn the apparent advantage of no European football into a disadvantage it is Manchester United.",
      "Already, the six or seven-day gap between games feel inauspicious. The downbeat mood festers for longer and there is not even a League Cup third round tie to play and fuel confidence that can be channelled into the next weekend fixture.",
      "One of the reasons why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in such immediate peril after United's 5-0 shellacking by Liverpool four years ago was that they did not have a midweek match. United were caught short and had no succession plan, so Solskjaer limped on for another four weeks.",
      "But the club had decided he would have to go and began devising a plan, incurring two more damaging defeats to Manchester City and Watford. In the Sir Elton John Stand at Vicarage Road, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",
      "Louis van Gaal only survived United's Boxing Day loss at Stoke - their fourth in a row - due to the tight turnaround. They hosted Chelsea two days later and performed spiritedly in a watchable goalless draw.",
      "The weeks drag in the wake of a defeat. United's next three fixtures are all Saturday kick-offs, so the gaps will be a day longer than the six days between City and Chelsea.",
      "Then it is another international fortnight. United had decided by last year's October internationals that Erik ten Hag would go. It was just a case of when. Inexplicably, they swung the axe three games after the October internationals.",
      "There was a rendition of \"sacked in the morning\" at the Etihad on Sunday. Ten Hag was dismissed on a Monday last year. That gave Ruud van Nistelrooy a full week in caretaker charge. United are not wavering on Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have one win from their opening five games, as they did in their last campaign devoid of European football in 2014-15. United did not maximise their lighter workload that season and scraped fourth place with one win from their final six games.",
      "Their season was salvaged by two six-game winning sequences in the winter and the spring. The latter featured victories against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City that remain among United's best against those sides in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "It was during that sprightly spring that Van Gaal settled on a winning formula. Six days after Arsenal ended United's chances of silverware in the FA Cup quarter-final, Van Gaal paired Chris Smalling with Phil Jones, moved Daley Blind to left back and recalled Juan Mata to the right wing. United were 3-0 up against Spurs at half-time.",
      "United were unchanged a week later at Liverpool, where they produced what remains their best performance at Anfield since the back-to-back 3-1 triumphs in 1997. That same XI started the Manchester derby three weeks later when United battered City 4-2.",
      "Amorim has made six changes across United's four league games. He has only ever picked an unchanged XI once, at Lyon four days after the goalless Old Trafford derby.",
      "Losing to a City side devoid of their fear factor and beaten in their previous two games by tactically astute teams warrants a major rethink. Amorim is never going to compromise on the failing 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to and his stubbornness extends to some selections.",
      "Overpromoting Altay Bayindir to first choice has not worked. Amorim said Bayindir could be like Edwin van der Sar. He is not as good as Raimond van der Gouw and Senne Lammens may as well go in goal sooner rather than later.",
      "Amorim talked his way into trouble by labelling Luke Shaw, who has broken the 40-appearance barrier in three out of 11 seasons, \"world-class\". Shaw has been reinvented as a centre half but remains an auxiliary option and Amorim has reduced Harry Maguire to a goalscoring impact sub.",
      "Managers can be too dogmatic about right-footed and left-footed centre backs and a few of them (Van Gaal, Amorim and Erik ten Hag) have ended up at United. United are better off with Maguire than Shaw. Maguire played on the left of a back three of only the third England team to reach a World Cup semi-final.",
      "For a 24-year-old, Manuel Ugarte is too naive as the designated defensive midfielder. Fulham coach Marco Silva and winger Alex Iwobi admitted they preyed on United's numerical disadvantage in midfield last month as their centre backs \"want to jump\". Ugarte has to take a back seat otherwise Amorim will revert to the less mobile Casemiro.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' redeployment in midfield is anathema to many accustomed to seeing him higher up the pitch yet he excelled from deep in the second half of last season, so much so he scored a hat-trick from there against Real Sociedad. United have a surfeit of No.10s and a paucity of midfield options. Keeping Fernandes further back is better for the team's balance but his defensive shortcomings have to be cut out and can be if Ugarte stays deeper.",
      "The wingers are a growing concern. Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu are inadequate in the final third. Given Amorim's preference for a left-footer on the left wing, Amad is worth a go as he is a superior footballer to the raw Dorgu.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are certain picks as the two playmakers when both are fit. Benjamin Sesko is pleading for time but his time could be up before he knows it unless he starts scoring. He has to consistently start, at least until the October internationals.",
      "The October international fortnight will be scrapped next year. The bad news is the September break will be extended to three weeks.",
      "Woe betide United if they are still out of Europe then.",

      "Phil Foden opened the scoring in the 18th minute of the Manchester derby at the Etihad last weekend and Erling Haaland scored twice in the second half to seal a comfortable 3-0 victory.",
      "The second inquest of the season has started at Old Trafford. The pressure on Amorim increased after Grimsby and the derby defeat has cranked up the noise around his future.",
      "United have made their worst start to a season since 1992/93, when they also had four points from their four matches under Sir Alex Ferguson, and Amorim has the unwanted record of having the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "So, what's next for Amorim? We've had a look at how he should respond to the City defeat.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is United's best player and Amorim is not getting the best out of him. Fernandes has made a poor start to the campaign and failed to track Phil Foden's run for the opening goal last weekend.",
      "Last month, Fernandes made the same mistake against Fulham at Craven Cottage when he didn't track Emile Smith Rowe, which shows he is struggling with the role's defensive aspects.",
      "The evidence from the opening few weeks of the season suggests Fernandes should be relocated further up the pitch.",
      "That means Fernandes would have to rotate with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the No.10 roles and minutes would have to be shared, but playing him in the pivot isn't working.",
      "Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Fernandes to start in midfield.",
      "In the final days of the summer transfer window, Mainoo requested to leave on loan for the sake of regular starts, but Amorim insisted that the youngster would stay and fight for his place.",
      "Fans have questioned why such a talented young player felt a change of scenery was necessary. Amorim has argued Mainoo is not the finished article, but the midfield is an issue and Mainoo could be a solution.",
      "It's time to play Mainoo and give him a consistent run of games in the midfield pivot. He started for England against Spain in the Euro 2024 final and has too much talent to be limited to substitute appearances.",
      "Mainoo thrived playing alongside Casemiro in his breakout season and that would be a logical partnership for the three games against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the international break.",
      "Altay Bayindir and Luke Shaw should lose their starting roles on the back of the derby defeat. Bayindir was not to blame for the loss, by any means, but he was shaky from the first whistle and should have done better for Erling Haaland's first goal, as he went to the ground too easily.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted screaming at Bayindir after City's third goal, trying to encourage his goalkeeper to keep his head up, and the Turkey international's confidence looks shattered.",
      "Senne Lammens is an unknown quantity, despite having a strong reputation in Belgium, but the bar is low to impress. Lammens needs to start against Chelsea, and another defensive change is required.",
      "Shaw had his worst game for United since his return from injury. The 30-year-old has started each Premier League game on the left of the back-three, but Harry Maguire should now replace him in the team.",
      "Amorim hasn't helped himself by picking players in the wrong positions, while his tendency to tweak the starting team each week has made it difficult for United to build momentum.",
      "Having a settled team might improve their chances of success, so Amorim should stick with the same starting XI for each game up until the October international break.",

      "It's ridiculous that United have entered must-win territory just four league games into the season, but if Chelsea win at Old Trafford, the talk around Amorim's future will intensify.",
      "United should target at least six points from Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland. The October international break will be an opportunity to assess Amorim and positive results are required to safeguard his future.",
      "The Reds found a way to win against Burnley before the September international break. That was key after Grimsby and it's just as important to bounce back against Chelsea.",

      "\"I can't see how this manager is avoiding the sack,\" a Manchester United season-ticket holder who was in the away end at the Etihad messaged. \"He’s had a free pass until now and it was always the case that he had to start the season well. He certainly hasn’t.\"",
      "Another was in the lower tier and remained until the end. \"Personally, I think he's finished,\" he admitted. \"Loads of reds want him to do well but there's nothing at all to say he's the man.\"",
      "\"He's getting hammered in the pub,\" another said. He was not referring to Ruben Amorim drowning his sorrows.",
      "\"Amorim is like a pigeon,\" another messaged, \"endlessly crashing into a glass window, dazed and stubborn, convinced he’ll break through if he just keeps at it.\"",
      "This is not the United matchgoers outright turning against Amorim. They are just resigned to another in-season managerial change.",
      "Amorim fronts up in defeat by strolling onto the pitch to applaud the supporters. There were only a handful remaining in the three tiers of the Etihad's South Stand at full-time on Sunday.",
      "City scoring at least three times, Phil Foden and Erling Haaland on the scoresheet, an emptying away end and an empty feeling. We have become accustomed to this watching United in derbies over the past 12 years. Amorim copped similar treatment to David Moyes, Jose Mourinho, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.",
      "And even if Amorim survives long enough to brave the red flares outside Anfield next month, Liverpool have form for immediately, or eventually, seeing off a United manager.",
      "Moyes was sacked 37 days after a 3-0 defeat. Van Gaal was sacked 74 days after a 2-0 defeat. Mourinho was sacked two days after a 3-1 defeat. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked 28 days after a 5-0 drubbing. Ten Hag was sacked 57 days after a 3-0 defeat.",
      "One sensed at Grimsby that Amorim had gone past the point of no return. That it was in the League Cup and on penalties barely tempered the nuclear fallout from that humiliation. Some players who started that night are unlikely to ever play for United again.",
      "The summer recruitment already appears dubious. United have the ingredients for an appetising filling but their sandwich crumbles with a flaky base and top.",
      "It is on Amorim that he promoted Altay Bayindir to first choice. In 15 appearances for United, Bayindir has conceded 26 goals.",
      "Senne Lammens is inexperienced, such an unknown quantity he was at United's original feeder club, and was not one of the four goalkeepers in the Belgium squad this month. He is due a chance sooner rather than later for the sake of variety.",
      "Benjamin Sesko had his most accomplished outing for United at City yet fired blanks again. It is seven goalless games for club and country this season. Rasmus Hojlund, typically, has found the back of the net for club and country since he fled the United maelstrom.",
      "Luke Shaw's stint as an auxiliary centre back may be over. Amorim, like Ten Hag, favours a left-footer on the left of central defence. The more sensible strategy would be to pick an actual centre back.",
      "Entrusting Shaw in the Europa League final backfired and it was a matter of time until it did so again this season. Harry Maguire is a specialist centre half and a better defender than Shaw but has been reduced to an impact substitute capable of increasing United's lowly goal threat.",
      "United's script on their weakened midfield has already come back to haunt them. Club sources claimed the area was never their priority in the transfer window given the \"strong and versatile options available\".",
      "Casemiro's only memorable performances this calendar year were restricted to the Europa League and United are not in Europe. Kobbie Mainoo has not started a league game since May, with Manuel Ugarte recalled ahead of him in the derby despite his first-half horror show at Grimsby.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount are not specialists. Mount has got injured in the second league fixture in each of his three seasons with United and then been sidelined for at least three weeks.",
      "Three opponents have scored against United through runs from deep. Fernandes was at the scene of the crime again for Phil Foden's 18th-minute header.",
      "Amorim clutched at straws. \"Guys, I understand how football is,\" he said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives.",
      "\"Against Arsenal, do you think we play well?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think we are the better team?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno. Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.\"",
      "Amorim reiterated that United would only stop playing in the 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to if they change manager. If he suddenly switched to a back four, United would not necessarily look much better.",
      "Lammens in goal, Noussair Mazraoui at right back, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt at centre half and Patrick Dorgu at left back, with Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in midfield, Fernandes as the No.10 with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha either side and Benjamin Sesko up front does not scream Champions League qualifying contenders.",
      "And as enterprising as United were against Arsenal, they lost without scoring to a team that did not perform and protected a 13th-minute goal gifted to them.",
      "That does not grant the manager a free pass.",

      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message.",

      "\"In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton. For me, he stabilised the club, at least he's going to put structure in there.",
      "\"Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'he said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",

      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Shearer delivered his verdict on Sesko and expressed his concern about how United used him. \"I look at Sesko, because I've obviously been in that position, and he had that one shot very early on in the game,\" Newcastle legend Shearer said.",
      "\"Other than that, he must be thinking, 'Any danger? Any chance of giving me something here?' Something to go after, some crosses.\"",
      "Ex-Leicester City and Tottenham forward Lineker added: \"He was absolutely starved of any real service. He went through once where he broke the offside trap and the keeper blocked his shot.",
      "\"But he does look quick for a big guy, and I watched him specifically for a lot of the game – as much as you can when you’re watching TV rather than being at the game – and his movement, he's making darting runs, but I felt for him a little bit.

      "Ruben Amorim will be sacked by Christmas if he doesn't change his approach at Manchester United, according to Rene Meulensteen.",
      "The Portuguese tactician has failed to bring about a marked improvement at Old Trafford so far this season, despite receiving a substantial backing from the board over the summer and being afforded a full pre-season tour to settle his squad. The 40-year-old suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on opening day, before mustering a draw against Fulham and a win over a newly-promoted Burnley.",
      "However, Sunday's Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium showed major holes in Amorim's system, as Manchester City ran out 3-0 winners on home soil while United failed to get going. And with the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Brighton to play across their next five outings, Meulensteen believes that the outlook is far from positive.",
      "Meulensteen, United's former first-team coach, told football betting site BetVictor: \"Could Ruben Amorim be gone before Christmas?, Absolutely, he could well be. And I think if he keeps being as stubborn as he is and the results don't improve, he doesn't keep winning, then there's definitely no other way than the club has to make a decision.",
      "\"I mean, how long are you going to keep traveling in the wrong direction? Every game and every week it's like, ‘Well, let's hope and see what we get this week.' Maybe you get the odd result like you did against Burnley, with a last-minute penalty to get that one over the line. Otherwise, they would have not won a game.",
      "\"They've got some tough, tough fixtures coming up, but like I said, there is definitely a possibility he goes in the next few months. If you lose to City, 3-0, but all the pundits can understand, it wasn't a 3-0 game, United really played well, they were unlucky, then maybe it would be different.",
      "\"But that wasn't the case. If the performances are not good and the results are not there, then you're going to get this question from week to week. It's just a continuation of the poor start to the season, which I was afraid of.",
      "\"I said he actually needs to win seven to eight of his first 10 games to reinforce that he has been able to do some work and that he believes in what he wants to do. But all this gets overshadowed by performances and results like this.",
      "\"You continuously get the same questions and reactions in the media about the system, and he says he won't change. He says if anything is going to change, then they have to change him. If he keeps that approach, then I think there's only one way he's heading: to the exit.",
      "\"I can't see anything different. So where does that leave United again? Where they left off last year, and that's where you don't want to be.\"",
      "The head coach was given the green light to spend big this summer, splashing out more than £200million on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo, while also strengthening in between the sticks with the acquisition of Senne Lammens after poor showings from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "With a tough clash awaiting them against Chelsea at Old Trafford come Saturday, fans will be eager to see an improved United performance. However, Enzo Maresca has cultivated an impressive squad of his own this summer, as evidenced by a four-game unbeaten streak in the league.",

There are a lot of things - you have no idea what happened during these months - but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose.",

I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",

      "Paul Scholes says he can't understand what is happening with Kobbie Mainoo at Manchester United.",
      "Mainoo was outstanding during his breakout season in 2023-24, establishing himself as a first-team starter following a special performance against Everton on his full Premier League debut.",
      "The youngster featured for England at Euro 2024 and started against Spain in the competition's final. Gareth Southgate said at the time: \"We haven't really had a player like him until now\".",
      "Last season was stop-start for Mainoo due to a few small injuries and concerns about where he fits into Ruben Amorim's system. Amorim played the midfielder in different positions, even using him as a false nine.",
      "Mainoo relocated to the deeper midfield role in pre-season this summer, but Amorim recently raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a start.",
      "The 20-year-old has not started in the Premier League so far this season and was introduced from the bench in the second half against Manchester City.",
      "And Scholes has been left puzzled. He told the BBC: \"No I can't [understand the situation]. He came onto the scene a couple of years ago and I thought 'Wow, what a player'.",
      "\"His legs have been questioned, but go back to that game yesterday and it's not all about that, they had plenty of possession. Bruno Fernandes can be fine in central midfield when he has hold of the ball.",
      "\"When you are playing against better teams, there are times when you're not going to have the ball, and that's when you have to know the position brilliantly. Every manager is clever these days, and Pep is the very best at getting people in behind his midfield. He had Foden doing it and Bernardo doing it.",
      "\"He had Doku coming inside. I've been there myself, you're constantly looking over your shoulder, thinking where is my man, it's a horrible place to be at times. If you're on the ball all the time, then Fernandes is brilliant [in deeper midfield].",
      "\"Now Kobbie Mainoo is the same I think on the ball, he can be fantastic, but he needs a proper partner next to him. I don't think Ugarte... he's got the legs but doesn't have the quality.",
      "\"We know Casemiro had the quality over the years but he's slowed down now. Again, I look at my career, I wasn't the greatest in that position, I didn't know it brilliantly well, but the guy next to me always did.",
      "\"They knew it so well, Roy Keane, Nicky Butt and Michael Carrick, they were perfect for me. I don't think the partnership is working for any of them because they don't know the position as well as they should.\"",
      "Speaking before the Manchester derby, Amorim discussed Mainoo and said: \"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"And I know that he can give that. So sometimes, like you said, maybe if I start more Kobbie Mainoo, then he is going to play and he's going to get hard to take out. Sometimes it's not fair, but I need to go with what I'm feeling in the moment, and that is the only feeling.",
      "\"I know that he started the final of the European Championship in one team that has a lot of talented players. (Phil) Foden played in that game. (Cole) Palmer was on the bench. He (Mainoo) was playing… I know all that. But sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.\"",
      "Scholes also questioned United's decision to sign Senne Lammens, who started the Manchester derby on the bench, while Gianluigi Donnarumma sparkled on his debut for City.",
      "\"If Man United weren't in for Donnarumma when he was made available, that should be a criminal offence,\" said Scholes.",
      "\"The new keeper [Lammens], brought in from Belgium, he was what, £20 million? I think that tells you what you need to know. It's very difficult to say what the ambition should be when they've got four points from four games. It's difficult to be ambitious when you see what you're seeing.\"",

      "Manchester United legend turned pundit Gary Neville has admitted that he is ‘worried’ about the team's future in the next few weeks amid growing pressure on manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Having failed to qualify for Europe, United now have a full week to prepare for their next game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday. Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast, the pundit said that the game needs to be the start of a turnaround for Amorim.",
      "“Ruben Amorim is going to come under big pressure, he’s going to come under big pressure, Manchester United are 14th in the league,” he said. “It’s only a few games in, it’s four games in, but next week, if Manchester United lose and they go and they go to 15th or 16th and it’s five games in, before you know it we’re in October and Manchester United are in the bottom half of the table and that’s where they couldn’t be, having spent £200 million, with him having a pre-season.",
      "“They might be seventh, eighth, ninth, they could be in those types of positions, but they can’t be in the bottom half of the table, so there’s got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager’s idea has got to land very quickly with the players.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "“I’m not saying here today that there’s any suggestion that the players have downed tools on him, they’ve not, but they’re struggling a little bit, they’re struggling, they’re struggling against Burnley at home, they’re struggling against Fulham away in large parts, they’re struggling at Grimsby, they struggled here today. They’re struggling with it, they’re struggling to find rhythm, to find tempo, to find performance levels.",
      "“I was really heartened by the first game of the season against Arsenal. I thought it was a really good performance, but maybe that was that they’d had a good pre-season. Maybe now Cunha gets injured, Mount gets injured, the old wounds are starting to open up, and I’m worried. I’m worried about the manager, worried about what’s going to happen in this next few weeks. I don’t think it’s a time for panic, but I’ve seen this before. We’ve seen this film.”",
      "Neville outlined the importance of a quick start against Chelsea next weekend, as a loss would only put more pressure on the manager and the club.",
      "“Losing away from home against City is never going to cost you your job, because the reality of it is, a lot of teams lose here,” he added. “But if you start to lose games at home, they just beat Burnley in the last minute, it is going to start to put pressure on the manager and you’re going to see more images of the owners in the box and Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and everybody else, you’re going to start to see more of those images appear.",
      "“So Manchester United have to find wins, they have to get wins in this latter part of September, early October, they cannot lose games, because if they carry on losing games, there’s going to be an outcry in the next few weeks and we don’t want that.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has said if Manchester United want to change their playing style they will have to change manager.",
      "United lost 3-0 at Manchester City in the first derby of the season to leave them with four points after their first four Premier League games in what is their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Amorim has overseen only eight wins out of the 31 Premier League games he has taken charge of and United are bottom of the 17-team table that consists of the league's ever-present teams dating back to his appointment.",
      "United hired Amorim on November 1 last year and he is under contract at the club until 2027 but the latest defeat is bound to fuel more uncertainty over his future.",
      "\"Guys, I understand that and I accept,\" Amorim said. \"It is not a record you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things - you have no idea what happened during these months - but I accept that. I am not going to change.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message.",
      "\"It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",
      "Amorim reiterated his belief United are better than last season, despite one win in five matches. They have also only scored one goal from open play in six hours of Premier League football.",
      "\"The results, again, I accept that,\" Amorim added. \"I see that we are doing better but the results don't show that. I remember last year we played in the former club against City. We won 4-1 (with Sporting in the Champions League). It was not near the opportunities, the way we control the game compared to today.",
      "\"In certain moments we were not better than City. I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.\"",
      "United started promisingly but Phil Foden nodded past Altay Bayindir in the 18th minute and two second-half goals from Erling Haaland secured victory.",
      "Haaland bulldozed Luke Shaw for his first goal and ran from inside his own half for another one-on-one with Bayindir that he converted. Not for the first time, Amorim felt United lacked aggression.",
      "\"If you look at the goals, we can avoid that kind of goal,\" he opined. \"We have almost everyone behind the ball and we could be more aggressive.",
      "\"The second goal, in the moment of the game that we are pressing City. We suffer a goal in the throw-in when we want to recover the ball instead of covering the space and then to win the ball. We let two players of City one against one. The approach that we had in that play we can avoid and we can close our goal.",
      "\"The third goal, Haaland has all the space. A confusion with our players and then he has all the space to play. In these moments I felt that if you look at the goals, there are moments we could avoid. That is the key of the game, it's to take advantage of these moments and they took it.",
      "\"In transitions, a great shot from Bryan (Mbeumo). In those moments they were better than us.\"",

      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker were both in agreement about Benjamin Sesko's performance during Manchester United's bruising 3-0 defeat against Manchester City.",
      "Sesko, 22, who joined United in a £73.7million move from RB Leipzig in the summer, made his first Premier League start at the Etihad Stadium. but struggled throughout the contest.",
      "Indeed, the Slovenia international had just 20 touches, one shot, completed 14 passes and won 33 per cent of his duels before he was replaced in the 80th minute.",
      "Although Sesko could have, maybe, done a little more to generate space and get involved, his United teammates didn't do him any favours with the lack of service he had.",
      "There were times where United had the chance to whip the ball into the box and give him the chance to attack a cross, but instead the ball either went back or inside.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Shearer delivered his verdict on Sesko and expressed his concern about how United used him. \"I look at Sesko, because I've obviously been in that position... and he had that one shot very early on in the game,\" the Newcastle legend said.",
      "\"Other than that, he must be thinking; 'Any danger? Any chance of giving me something here'? Something to go after, some crosses.\"",
      "Ex-Leicester City and Tottenham forward Lineker added: \"He was absolutely starved of any real service. He went through once where he broke the offside trap and the keeper blocked his shot.",
      "\"But he does also look quick for a big guy, and I watched him specifically for a lot of the game - as much as you can when you're watching TV rather than being at the game - and his movement, he's making darting runs, but I felt for him a little bit. It's tough when you're not getting any service.\"",
      "Having watched him for Leipzig in the Champions League last season, Shearer admitted he felt that the money United paid might have been too much, given how much pressure the Reds are under.",
      "Shearer concluded: \"I saw him last year a couple of times, Champions League, it's a lot of money for him and it's a massive ask for him to go in at a club and be in a team that's under huge pressure - from where they are to where they're trying to get to. I think it’s a huge ask for him to go in and be successful this season.\"",
      "Sesko has failed to score in five appearances for the Reds, so far. He started in their Carabao Cup second round defeat to Grimsby Town last month, but once again failed to impress.",
      "United ended up crumbling to a 3-0 defeat against City, with Phil Foden opening the scoring in the 18th minute before Erling Haaland fired a second-half brace to finish United off.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "“It’s a good choice. Andre was struggling at Manchester United,” he said to Africa Foot.",
      "“Last season, he was heavily criticised, and since the start of the season, he’d barely played (one cup match), and everyone, including him, understood that he was likely to spend a lot of time on the bench or in the stands.",
      "“I told him he was right. It’s a good choice. It’s better to be a starter at a very good club in a good league than a substitute at a big club in a big league, right?",
      "“In Turkey, he’ll certainly be watched, because he’s a very good goalkeeper, but I think he’ll be under a little less pressure than at Manchester United.”",
      "Kameni has so much confidence that Onana will return to his best form sooner rather than later, that he believes that there could potentially be a scramble for his services next summer.",
      "Asked if Onana could be back at a top five European side, he replied: “Yes. He hasn’t lost his qualities at Manchester United.",
      "“As can happen to all great athletes, he may experience a more complicated spell for a few months. Andre Onana is very professional, he remains a reliable player, and if he has a good season in Turkey, he’ll be in demand next summer.”",
      "Onana still has just under three years left to run on the contract he signed when completing a £47.5m move from Italian giants Inter Milan.",
      "Since then, he has made 102 appearances for United, with high-profile errors blighting his game. Onana made just one appearance for United this season ahead of completing his switch to Turkey.",
      "That came in the embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Onana was handed his debut for his new employers on Sunday after being named in the starting lineup to face Fenerbahce. There were a number of familiar faces in the opposition side.",

      "Erling Haaland's second half brace secured an ultimately comfortable victory for Pep Guardiola's side and leaves United with four points from four games heading into the clash with Chelsea.",

If you see City, every time we pass the ball backwards to our centre backs, they go three against three and their line squeezes us so much and it is very difficult to break through the lines because the space is very narrow.\"",

      "\"We play with a back five or whatever you want to call it and we need obviously people to be aggressive in the moment of pressure and with the jumping (to press),\" he added.",

      "Jamie O’Hara has hit out at Ruben Amorim for being “arrogant” and “stuck in his ways” as he feels Manchester United need to “bite the bullet” and get rid of him.",
      "It has not been a great start to the season for United, who finished 15th in the Premier League last term. They have four points from as many games in the league, and suffered an embarrassing League Cup loss to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Pressure in the media is ramping up on manager Amorim, who is struggling to get his side playing well, and former Premier League midfielder O’Hara feels it’s time to go as he ranted about United’s issues under the boss.",
      "“They’re one of the worst Man United teams I’ve ever seen. Win percentage is one of the worst since World War Two.",
      "“I think they’ve got 31 points from 31 games that he’s been involved in. It’s relegation form, it really is.",
      "“They’ve got to bite the bullet and say this is not going to work.",
      "“There’s no progression, there’s no improvement. The only improvement you could potentially say is they’ve signed some decent players, in Bryan Mbeumo, in [Matheus] Cunha.”",
      "Indeed, O’Hara feels there’s been no standout performances which show United can turn things around.",
      "“In terms of performances there’s no improvement. They played well against Arsenal – they lost at home – they had a decent game but they didn’t score.",
      "“They were absolutely terrible against Grimsby, shocking performance, shocking against Man [City] and they were bang average against Burnley. They needed a lot minute mistake fro a Burnley player to go and win the game.",
      "“If that didn’t happen, they’d be sitting on two points. Come on, this is unacceptable for Man United.",
      "“I get it, they want to try and back a manager and they want to have stability, I’m sorry, I have never seen a performance so bad from a Man United team. It’s getting worse and worse.",
      "“And you can’t tell me it’s going to all of a sudden change and they’re going to get better. He’s been backed, he’s got players in and they’re still terrible.",
      "“The formation doesn’t work, they’ve got no identity, the players have got a complete lack of confidence on the ball, without the ball.",
      "“They don’t get the system, they cannot make it work, and Ruben Amorim is so arrogant and so stuck in his ways of ‘this is how I’m going to play.’ You’re basically telling the team every single week this is how Man United are going to set up, this is the performance they’re going to put in and let’s work on that and go and beat them.”",
      "O’Hara also feels that Bruno Fernandes is having the creativity sucked out of him by being played in the wrong role.",
      "“They get over in midfield every single week. They’ve got one of the best creative midfielders in the world in Bruno Fernandes, they’re trying to play him as a No.6, he’s not a No.6, he’s a No.10, he’s an attacking midfielder.",
      "“You’re taking everything away from his game. Honestly it’s painful to watch.”",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson reckons Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim “would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea” as they have the players to suit his system.",

      "“There will be a decision to make on Manuel Ugarte. I can reveal to you that of Manuel Ugarte, there was a possibility of exit this summer, because, for example, Italian clubs were interested in Ugarte, but Manchester United decided to close doors to an eventual loan move. So this is why nothing happened for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "“We have to see if some club will arrive with a permanent term, permanent deal proposal in 2026 because this might change the situation at the moment, Ugarte started the Manchester Derby has the confidence of Ruben Amorim, for sure, is working very hard and super hard, but there is interest from Italy, and so that could be a case to follow in the upcoming months.",

      "“But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No.10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.",
      "“I did both roles. As a No.10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It’s a totally different mindset.”",

      "Unfortunately, what wasn’t in the script was them just continuing to win games whilst playing this way.",
      "They were meant to be dropping points, allowing other teams to put pressure on them in the title race. But they reckoned without the elite winning mentality in the dressing room, the one that runs right through the team, one that refuses to accept anything apart from winning games.",

      "It’s clear that a lot of the reaction to Liverpool this season has been based on mailboxers watching highlights and/or alerts on social media. Had they watched the full 90s (admittedly a slog for the Arsenal game) they would have seen a team that was so deliberate and varied in its attack that they earned their wins through elite management and attacking talent plus sheer graft.",
      "Liverpool were cruising 2-0 against Bournemouth when, while going for a third, they carelessly gave the ball away twice and conceded two excellent breakaway goals. Slot managed the situation and his substitute (Chiesa) scored what was effectively the winner.",
      "It was a similar story against Newcastle. Of course the timing of the goal, the age of the goalscorer and the context of the Isak transfer raised the stakes but once again, Slot managed the situation and it paid off as he had hoped.",
      "The Arsenal game was a battle for tactical supremacy and therefore a largely dull affair. However, at half time Slot instructed his team to increase the intensity of passing and make more direct runs. It almost paid off twice, with one attempt being ruled out for offside while the other led to a free kick which won the game. Even that wasn’t dumb luck as Szoboszlai has a decent record of scoring freekicks.",
      "Liverpool dominated Burnley by every measure. So much so that Van Dijk and Konate’s average position was probably in the attacking half(!) But yet again, Slot managed his personnel and tactics and so eventually, 100 minutes of attacking pressure forced an error, resulting in a pressure penalty which still look some Egyptian minerals to put away.",
      "Is there room for improvement? Yes. Have the matches been a breathtaking spectacle? No. However, Liverpool have not been lucky either. The manager has managed the situations and when called upon, the players have made some stunning contributions. That’s keeping in mind they’ve played 3 of last season’s best teams as well has a promoted team that hadn’t lost at home for a whole season (in the Champo, obviously).",
      "Is it sustainable? Well, possibly yes because I doubt Slot will forget his tactical nous and it’s unlikely Liverpool’s vast array of attackers will all have stinkers all at the same time for most of the season.",
      "It won’t guarantee Liverpool will win the league though. Arsenal have their best squad for 20 years and Man City have a genius coach. If Liverpool carry on as they are, they will challenge. But if they can improve then they’ll be strong favourites to take the crown again.\nNilesh, Harrow",

Well I’m here to tell you that this just isn’t the case, outside of Ferguson and say Matt Busby, United have always been an average club/team that got lucky with one man.",
      "Man United is a huge club with many supporters across the globe, often being touted as THE biggest club in world football and an inherently successful club for the whole time it’s been around – but a closer examination of the club’s history reveals something different, Manchester United’s golden era of dominance is almost entirely attributable to one man, Alex Ferguson.",
      "Outside his reign (and a good few years under Matt Busby) the club has struggled to maintain consistent success, which means United are not this inherently successful club we’ve been led to believe and never have been.",
      "Before Ferguson’s appointment in 1986, Manchester United’s trophy cabinet was hardly bulging. In 109 years from when they were founded in 1878 to when Ferguson was given the job in 1986, United won the league title just seven times, a decent amount of titles but hardly dominant. For most of its life it was overshadowed by more successful clubs like Liverpool. They had a modicum of success under Matt Busby who won 5 of their 7 league titles and one European cup.",
      "As an aside my grandad who was a scouser and staunch Liverpool fan would always say they were the greatest side he’d ever seen even after watching the Liverpool sides of the 70’s and 80’s. They obviously had the Munich air disaster which curtailed what could’ve been a longer stretch of dominance but inbetween these great managers the club endured long droughts, relegations, and instability.",
      "It was under Alex Ferguson that Manchester United became the powerhouse that we all know today. Between 1986 and 2013, United won 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 Champions Leagues. Ferguson built and rebuilt squads and created a culture of excellence. He wasn’t just the manager of Man United, he was Man United.",
      "Since his retirement in 2013, Manchester United have failed spectacularly to replicate Ferguson’s success. Despite having seasoned high-profile managers like José Mourinho, Louis van Gaal etc… and spending billions in some of the so called best players in the world, the club has failed get the results it thinks it deserves. They’ve won the odd trinket here and there but never coming close to the big fellas like the league and Champions League.",
      "This post-Ferguson decline exposes the truth that Manchester United is not inherently successful. It was Ferguson who instilled a winning mentality, developed world-class players, and created a dynasty. Without him, the club has been unable to stand on its own two feet.",
      "The myth of Manchester United as this great inherently successful club is just that, a myth. The club’s success story is the story of one man basically. Without Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United has reverted back to its mean, an average club with delusions of grandeur.\nMick T, Liverpool",

      "The current squad is a mixture of very good, pretty average, past their sell by dates, young and inexperienced, and frankly ridiculously over rated players. All if this due to a succession of terrible manager appointments and even worse transfer dealings. If Liverpool did indeed consider Amorim as a replacement for Klopp and as is believed, walked away having held discussions over playing style, what numpty’s at United didn’t hold the same conversation? Whilst City will spend £50mil on a player and twelve months later another £60mil on an upgrade, United have spent millions on the wrong player and even more on another in the same position who is no better than what they have or is yet another fingers crossed signing.",
      "Is there a funnier sight than watching a Premier League record signing once again be caught out of position and desperately looking like he’s running through mud to try and recover whilst failing again, add to that an unfit full back, who everyone knows is unfit, also labouring.\nRecord after record is being set as the worst ever start is now replaced by a new worst ever start. And yet the mailbox is still populated with people saying “we can finish top 4 with some good signings in January”, I saw youtube video of a fan saying that Sesko was excellent and De Ligt was excellent in a game City won without breaking sweat. Do these fans really believe that ‘cos if they do, they are part of the problem.",
      "With the possible exception of Mbeumo, United don’t have a single player who would be a starter in any of the top 6 sides from last season (well maybe Villa) a damning indictment on their transfer dealings and yet the fans still believe (admirable but delusional), and still find excuses.",
      "United’s problems lie in every aspect, the owners, the management, the playing staff and the fan base, until at least one recognises it’s part in this shitshow, nothing will change.",
      "And whilst I will get some flak I would point Utd fans to The Spirit of Shankly, a body which ultimately forced our despised owners and their totally inadequate manager and his totally inadequate players out of the club, it still took a while to get the club back to where it had been but it has been done.

      "After buying his stake in Manchester United 18 months ago, Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted he and his INEOS team had “made a lot of cock-ups” in his other footballing ventures, Lausanne and Nice, presumably in a bid to convince the Red Devils fans that they had learned lessons from those mistakes that would not be repeated at Old Trafford.",
      "“Huge change” off the pitch certainly hasn’t been for the better on it. Ruben Amorim is the latest Manchester United manager ‘losing the dressing room’, differing from predecessor Erik ten Hag only in sticking to a (failing) philosophy rather than not having one and seemingly wanting to be sacked rather than preferring to keep the most ill-fated job in football.",
      "Ratcliffe’s made questionable strategic calls and ill-advised comments in interviews that are among the mistakes we’ve listed here, including some that the Ratcliffe advocates will claim weren’t his decisions, but – despite his clear ethos of passing it wherever possible – the buck stops with him.",
      "Anyway, strap yourselves in: Ratcliffe’s mistakes ranked from minor to major.",
      "",
      "It doesn’t seem all that unreasonable for a struggling organisation not to hand out £100 Christmas bonuses and instead give members of staff a £40 M&S voucher, and the employees themselves may well have been fine had it been explained to them properly and hadn’t been part of a widespread cost-cutting scheme that’s seen many of their friends and colleagues made redundant while what we assume is now half-ply loo paper is on hand the toilets.",
      "“At least the Glazers prioritised families,” said one staffer. “And anuses,” said another, probably.",
      "",
      "We suspect the Manchester United fans were delighted to hear about Ratcliffe and Ineos’ plan to conduct a ‘thorough strategic review’ of the football club when the British billionaire took charge of all football operations. After years of Glazer family negligence, on and off the pitch, it was necessary.",
      "But while we imagined people in hard hats pointing to leaks in the Old Trafford roof and football coaching svengali Jason Wilcox shaking his head on the side-lines of an Erik ten Hag training session, we didn’t foresee Big Sir Jim himself picking up dirty socks from the academy dressing room.",
      "It’s a level of scrutiny that in some ways reflects well on the fourth-richest man in Britain – he has a hands-on approach – but upon describing the cleanliness of the youth team changing rooms as a ‘disgrace’, along with many of the other facilities on his tour of the club in a leaked whole staff email, Ratcliffe immediately managed to ‘create a toxic feeling inside Carrington’.",
      "He labelled the Manchester United museum – quite possibly the pride and joy of several members of staff – a load of ‘crap’, and in a bid to end the work-from-home culture, told employees to head back to the offices, despite there not being enough desks for them all to work from. ‘If you don’t like it, please seek alternative employment,’ he told them.",
      "Your Simon Jordans claimed it was a necessary shake-up, a method of sorting the wheat from the chaff, but there’s also little doubt that some very capable employees – not necessarily all Gen Z woke snowflakes – won’t have enjoyed Ratcliffe’s authoritarian day-one approach, will have taken it as a bleak sign of what was to come and taken a job in a more forward-thinking environment.",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe’s claim that a “conversation” with the government was required after proposing that Old Trafford is redeveloped into the ‘Wembley of the North’ was galling, to put it mildly.",
      "The suggestion was that the burden of financing United’s next chapter should be shared between him, a man worth around £12bn, and the taxpayers. A brazen proposal even before you consider that Ratcliffe himself is a tax exile having officially changed his residence in 2020 from Hampshire to Monaco in a move estimated to have saved him £4bn, which is enough to build two Wembleys of wherever.",
      "",
      "We all know the guy – it’s always a guy – who suddenly appears one day, is overly friendly in a bid to gain confidences, laughing and joking one second and comically stern the next to keep everyone on their toes. Can be seen staring at walls and slowly stirring tea before snapping out of what we assume is a daydream about making a suit of human skins to ask if you’d like a cup. Yeahhh y’know, that guy.",
      "Ratcliffe’s ‘spy’ is said to be one of the Ineos chiefs taking roles and ‘assuming greater importance’ at the club, deepening what several sources described as a “growing culture of fear”, with staff members tiptoeing around this particular individual for fear of the sack, ‘being extra vigilant about what they say in his presence’.",
      "",
      "In order to give Manchester United the best chance of on-field success, no saving is off-limits in the Ratcliffe regime, as those travelling to the FA Cup final discovered.",
      "As joyous as that day became, any staff attending did so without recourse to former privileges. They each paid £20 towards travel costs that previously came as a perk of the job, while packed lunches were also seen as a luxury they could do without by the penny-pinchers at a club that saved a whopping £6,500 on the day before revealing record revenues of £660m shortly after the Wembley win.",
      "Top lad Bruno Fernandes offered to pay for the staff travel but the Ineos chiefs rejected that proposal because they thought ‘it would reflect badly on the regime’, and apparently didn’t think anyone would have an issue with ‘thousands being shelled out on chauffeured cars’ to take them to the very same event.",
      "",
      "Not nearer the top because they only ‘considered it’ but even thinking about cutting the disabled supporters’ association budget in half is deplorable.",
      "As David Ornsein said, it’s “terrible optics” for a football club that has routinely spunked tens of millions of pounds on average footballers to believe that a viable and reasonable method of cutting costs is to make the lives of their disabled supporters harder. The audacity would almost be impressive if it wasn’t so shameful.",
      "",
      "It would be unreasonable for Ratcliffe to know the name of all, or even most, Manchester United employees. There are a lot of them; far too many in his opinion. But we reckon the captain of the football club should have been in the top ten names learned by Ratcliffe before he rocked up.",
      "We would have thought Katie Zelem wearing a training kit and boots might have been a bit of a giveaway as Ratcliffe doddered towards her like a 99-year-old royal and asked: “And what do you do, little lady?” Disappointed that the competition winner hadn’t curtsied as he approached.",
      "",
      "One good decision Ratcliffe has made was to end the club’s financial commitment to Sir Alex Ferguson. Cutting the jobs of 250 Normal People while continuing to pay £2m to a manager who retired over a decade ago would have been laughable, legend or not.",
      "But the co-owner can consider himself very fortunate that Ferguson still has his ear to the Old Trafford ground having reportedly advised him against an extraordinary move that would have been a PR disaster of epic proportions and speaks to Ratcliffe’s lack of knowledge of what’s important to the football club.",
      "Anyone asked about landmark events in the history of Manchester United would talk extensively about the Busby Babes, who came through the youth ranks and were touted to dominate European football before the Munich air disaster. Their story is woven into the fabric of the football club.",
      "What you don’t want to be doing as the new figurehead of Manchester United is dishonouring those young men or anyone associated with them in any way whatsoever, which makes his supposed plan to ‘revoke the privileges given to the families of the Busby Babes at United’ a truly incredible one.",
      "‘The families of players involved in Sir Matt Busby’s legendary side are regulars in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, but the club’s part-owners had threatened to put an end to those positions’ the report claims, with Ratcliffe’s view presumably that those seats could instead be given to very rich people from faceless companies who may throw a few million his way. Find another way, you berk.",
      "",
      "We don’t think we’ve ever heard of a club increasing ticket prices during a season; as MUST said, the idea that the fans must pay their ‘fair share’ for the club’s excesses and/or mismanagement — and above all, the Glazers lack of investment over two decades — is offensive.",
      "And we would suggest that a parent wanting to take their child to a game and having to shell out £132 for the privilege almost certainly doesn’t give a sh*t about the need to improve ‘operational efficiencies’ and ‘stabilise revenues’. They want to watch good football (alright, baby steps) for less than the cost of their monthly council tax.",
      "In response to the backlash, Ratcliffe said Manchester United are “mediocre” (no arguments here) when “it’s supposed to be one of the best football club’s in the world”. And in every interview he gives he talks about this gap between what they once were and what they are, in a We’re All In This Together sort of way, as if he’s suggesting every United fan should be direct debiting part of their salary to fix problems they have nothing to do with.",
      "The money the fans have already given has been wasted for years, and you want them to pay more to watch arguably the worst collection of footballers in Premier League history? Jog on, mate. An ‘outright rebellion’ is in the post.",
      "",
      "Before Ratcliffe arrived, even under the ownership of those horrible Glazers, Manchester United is said to have felt like a family club despite its global reach. Kath Phipps had a helluva lot to do with that.",
      "She first joined the club as the switchboard operator in September 1968, and was seemingly beloved by anyone who came into contact with her, acting as a bridge that crossed multiple eras.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Jonny Evans were among her famous, frequent visitors in her last months in care, with her friends at the club, including several who had been ousted in the cuts, running a daily rota via WhatsApp to ensure she was never alone until her passing, two days after which her next of kin got a phone call from the club.",
      "A message of condolence presumably, maybe from Ratcliffe himself, letting the bereaved individual know that everyone at the club is thinking of them. That should probably be the minimum when the longest-serving employee of the football club you own dies.",
      "But no, what they received was a call from the football club that had been Kath’s life to enquire about the status of her two season tickets. Scarcely believable evidence of the ‘heart and soul’ of the football club eroding under Ratcliffe.",
      "It being the dearly departed Kath Phipps makes it worse, of course it does, but to think that it would also happening to other Manchester United fans is also really, really horrible.",
      "And if you’re one of the many, many United fans currently shouting It’s Not Sir Jim That’s Making The Phone Calls, you’re absolutely right, but while it’s also probably not Ratcliffe forcing the poor member of staff to take on this abhorrent task, it’s he who has created an environment where money needs to be saved at all costs, including the feelings of the very recently bereaved and the once-highly respected reputation of the football club.",
      "",
      "The optics aren’t great when only a few months after staff members were all told they were crucial in helping contribute to on-field success, 250 of them were made redundant as part of Ratcliffe’s determination to slash costs by scrapping ‘non-essential’ activities.",
      "Nearly a quarter of United’s employees lost their jobs and many of them, understandably, may well have pointed out that poor first-team recruitment has wasted far more money than will have been saved by cutting the rank-and-file workforce.",
      "And those redundancies were made before the club spent £200m in the summer of 2024 on further under-performing footballers, and another £200m this summer on players we can only assume will be similarly underwhelming.",
      "Each of the 250 employees would have to be earning £55,000 per year to make getting rid of them more cost effective than paying Matthijs de Ligt his salary, and that’s without considering the centre-back’s transfer fee, which would have been enough to keep those staff members in their jobs on that wage for three years.",
      "",
      "At the end of June, four months after his purchase of 27% of Manchester United (yes, Manchester United as a whole), Ratcliffe was asked whether he had considered spinning off the women’s team, with Chelsea having recently announced that their side will become a standalone entity.",
      "“We haven’t got into that level of detail with the women’s team yet. We’ve been pretty much focused on how we resolve the first team issues.”",
      "We understand why the men’s team is the priority. It’s the cash cow and what him and his team will ultimately be judged upon. But word to the wise Jim, don’t call them ‘the first team’. The women aren’t reserves just because they’re not men.",
      "A slip of the tongue, maybe, but a telling one which when added to him moving the women out of their training facility and into portable buildings to make room for the men, hardly paints Ratcliffe as a beacon of equality.",
      "Asked in the same interview about what they are doing with the women’s team, Ratcliffe replied: “Well they’ve just won the FA Cup” as if he a) cared having not even watched the game, and b) had anything whatsoever to do with that success.",
      "And imagine if he had given the same answer about the men when – as he well knows – the 2024 FA Cup win deflected from a poor league season and much deeper problems. He did not seem to have the same grasp of the issues with the women’s team, who finished 20 points behind champions Chelsea in the WSL that season.",
      "",
      "Instead of sacking Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 (more on that to come) they got rid of his two assistant coaches, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag, replacing them with Rene Hake and Ruud van Nistelrooy, who are arguably the two guys to have been most screwed by Ratcliffe and INEOS’ bungling.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought his own coaches because it would be mad to leave behind the people who have played a significant role in his success at Sporting, meaning Ruud moved to Leicester to destroy his reputation and Rene et al. were out on their ears after three months at Old Trafford.",
      "A lucky escape some would argue and they’ve been well-compensated, as were Sporting for United nicking their manager and coaching staff, which all-in-all left United too close to the PSR line to do anything of significant in January to help Amorim.",
      "",
      "Going for Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez or any other clear No.1 goalkeeper is weird, but it can at least be explained away with a view to not paying exorbitant wages and with an eye on the future. But there is no reasonable explanation for spending well over £200m and failing to fix the biggest problem in the team.",
      "No-one at that football club can believe that Manuel Ugarte is good enough, that Bruno Fernandes can play as one of the two in midfield or that Casemiro still has it in him. They also know, without doubt, that Amorim isn’t going to change his system. So why the p*ssing hell did they not buy Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfield machine?",
      "They are quite clearly f***ed and will continue to get f***ed without one. And we know Ratcliffe probably isn’t involved in transfer strategy, but a huge fan as he purports to be, with the chequebook in hand, should be insisting on a midfielder as the priority. Don’t have another £100m? Fine. Don’t use all of your cash on three forwards. Absolute madness.",
      "",
      "It now looks as though Ratcliffe has missed the resignation boat as Amorim has now dug his philosophical heels into the Old Trafford turf, insisting after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City that “If they [United hierarchy] want it [the philosophy] changed, you change the man.”",
      "But he had at least one opportunity to get rid of Amorim without the need for compensation, instead opting to talk Amorim down from the ledge following the 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January when he was ‘prepared to resign’, and reports after the embarrassing defeat to Grimsby Town claimed there was once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "It suggests little more than a nudge in that direction may have been required to bring his doomed tenure to an end.",
      "",
      "It was very, very funny, and embarrassing to the point where Ratcliffe must have considered ploughing on with a guy he clearly had no time or respect for as sporting director purely to avoid the humiliation.",
      "They spent no little time and money to haul him out of Newcastle, only to mutually consent him out the door after just five months in which the club spent £180m on players who have made next to no difference to their fortunes and hired a new manager who’s now as doomed as the one they got rid of.",
      "Amorim’s appointment was supposedly the big disagreement between Ashworth, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United brains trust, with Ashworth wanting either an English coach (Gareth Southgate specifically), Thomas Frank or for Ruud van Nistelrooy to stay in interim charge until the end of the season. He knew his stuff, eh?",
      "‘Who would you appoint if we sacked Erik ten Hag now?’ should have been the very first question in Ashworth’s interview.",
      "",
      "Handing someone who had just overseen the worst season in the club’s history a contract extension is one of the worst decisions made by anyone ever. They played well once, in the FA Cup final, having embarrassed themselves in the semi-final against Coventry, the entire Champions League campaign and the vast majority of their league fixtures. Manchester United were awful.",
      "Their excuse for not replacing Ten Hag being the lack of suitable alternatives was quickly exposed as nonsense given the manager they’ve now hired was so available in the summer that he flew to London to meet West Ham on the eve of his side’s crunch clash with Porto in their title run-in.",
      "",
      "We were told that Jason Wilcox, brought in as the new technical director, would be the man to ‘determine and drive the move to a clear “game model” – effectively a cohesive playing style and identity United intend to replicate across all age groups.’",
      "And apparently, unbelievably, after ‘providing a detailed assessment of Ten Hag’s strengths and weaknesses’ as the first duty in his new post, Wilcox reported back that not only was Ten Hag the right man for the job, he was also so good at his job that the club should continue to sign players to fit his system rather than individuals with a broader ethos in mind.",
      "Wilcox and the other directors may claim it’s a happy coincidence that the style of their former first-team coach was also the new Manchester United Way, though wouldn’t be at all surprised if the new Manchester United Way is actually more in line with Amorim’s ethos, which has required a host of his players rather than the bunch bought for Ten Hag that clearly aren’t fit for purpose as the perpetual cycle of Red Devils managers being five to six signings away from challenging for the title continues.",
      "",
      "Ashworth ‘warned’ them and they didn’t listen. He correctly foresaw that there would be ‘mass disruption’ if Amorim and his very specific ideas and playing style arrived mid-season. He must be p*ssing himself as that disruption continues unabated into the Portuguese manager’s first full season at Old Trafford.",
      "Ashworth wanted to ‘minimise upheaval’ after the squad had already had to adjust to a new backroom team under Ten Hag before being told to forget all that and to get used to a system most of them had never played before, with no time for adaptation with games coming thick and fast.",
      "Liverpool had considered Amorim but went for Slot as the Portuguese manager’s ‘three at the back and general philosophy jarred with the squad’. United made no such consideration having cared only about Amorim’s impressive ‘aura’. Boy are they regretting that now.",
      "Ratcliffe wanted United to be ‘chest out and bold’ and was ‘desperate for charisma’. Little did he know that that’s apparently all Amorim has.",
      "He told the club that he wanted to wait and join in the summer, but Omar Berrada told him it was ‘now or never’. If offered the chance to choose again, it would definitely be never.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’ to offload Andre Onana, which has taken the 29-year-old ‘by surprise’.",
      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "According to reports, Sir Jim Ratcliffe prevented Manchester United from making a ‘proposal’ for a shock re-signing in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Manchester United are back. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ‘masterminded’ a big spend, ‘rebuilt’ everything and even won the Alejandro Garnacho transfer situation.",
      "Manchester United have put forward plans for their new stadium which they aim to open in 2030.",
      "Man Utd are not budging on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer even if it means moving on to different targets, according to reports."

      "Manchester United are rotten. Historically wretched. And the most frustrating aspect of it all is that it does not have to be this way.",
      "But are they telling a story of a team which has found its level, or one of long-term underperformance?",
      "Sure, there are some players promoted above their level by poor judgement or the refusal to source a better alternative. But the sum of United’s parts has to be better than this.",
      "That’s on Amorim. The squad should shoulder their substantial portion of the blame since it is they who are consistently failing in the moments. City showed them on Sunday the levels required at key times in both boxes and the contrast was woefully stark.",
      "But the manager is responsible for the shape his players take. And for as long as Amorim is in charge, we know that United will be playing 3-4-2-f***ing-1.",
      "That is his Thing. Amorim is the most dogmatic coach in the Premier League and, evidently, he would sacrifice his job before his tactical principles.",
      "Brave? Absolutely. Stupid? Draw your own conclusions.",
      "At this stage, it is beginning to look like an act of self-sabotage. In fairness to Amorim, his steadfast refusal to consider another way cannot come as a surprise to United or anyone else. They knew what they were getting when they hired him from Sporting Lisbon. But everyone else now knows what they are facing when they go up against United. Which would be fine if the system worked.",
      "But it plainly doesn’t. You can pin that on a number of factors. Among them: players who can’t or won’t adapt; ropey recruitment; the hopeless predictability of it all.",
      "Amorim’s primary function as manager of Manchester United is to get the best out of the group of players at his disposal. Which his beloved system does not. And the chances of that changing in a timely fashion are slimmer than the fit on his chinos.",
      "If Amorim won’t consider the possibility that there might be a better way, one which plays to his squad’s strengths, then it ought to be a quick and easy win for his replacement.",
      "In United’s current predicament, they could be forgiven – encouraged, actually – for going back to basics with a system their players know and understand.",
      "Would the United squad be more comfortable in a 4-2-3-1? Almost certainly. Which highlights the ridiculousness of Amorim not opening his mind even slightly.",
      "Firstly, it puts his best player, Bruno Fernandes, in his best position, the no.10 role. Not shunted towards the flank as one of the two wider players off a frontman, or shoehorned in as one of the double pivot. With Matheus Cunha one side of him, Bryan Mbuemo the other, maybe United’s centre-forward, currently Benjamin Sesko, would not be set up to fail.",
      "At the back, there is comfort in familiarity. United’s players are showing no sign of mastering a three-man defence because, almost certainly, they have spent most of their careers to this point in a four. Thriving in a four is most likely where United found them.",
      "That is hardly unique to United’s squad. In 2023/24, the top 13 in the Premier League all played with a back four. Of course there were variations, but of the same theme. Of the bottom seven, more than half employed a back three, including two of the relegated clubs.",
      "Last season, 83% of the formations used in the top flight had a back four as its foundation. United account for almost a quarter of the usage of a back three.",
      "The patterns point at four being better than three. Especially when there’s no evidence that a back three suits the players available. But, principles.",
      "The midfield remains a problem whatever the shape due to the absence of a mobile defensive midfielder. A flaw United are aware of. But haven’t bothered to fix.",
      "Perhaps they are hoping Manuel Ugarte might yet come good. Or they can eke another season out of Casemiro’s legs. Regardless, if United stumble upon a top-class no.6, they may also unlock Kobbie Mainoo’s potential. The ceiling of which is far higher than Amorim believes in his system.",
      "United cannot make another attempt to fix their midfield until January at the earliest. Most likely it will be next summer. By which time Amorim will be long gone without some concessions on his part or a vast and sudden improvement that his precious formation looks incapable of delivering.",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Jamie O’Hara has hit out at Ruben Amorim for being “arrogant” and “stuck in his ways” as he feels Manchester United need to “bite the bullet” and get rid of ...",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson reckons Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim “would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea” as they have the players to suit his system.",
      "Manchester United and Liverpool continue to dominate the discourse, with some keen to point out that United are just reverting to the norm.",
      "Are Liverpool getting through a settling-in period while avoiding setbacks or do early results mask a genuinely fundamental problem for the champions?",
      "Florian Wirtz and Enzo Maresca are under pressure, while Newcastle v Barcelona and Man City v Napoli should both be great fun as the Champions League returns."

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",

      "However, the trajectories of each striker have gone in opposing directions at the start of this season; Sesko has been ineffective and is goalless in five appearances, while Hojlund immediately got off the mark with a goal in his Serie A debut for Napoli.",

      "Last season, Hojlund’s general play was really poor and he was rightly criticised, but it was no wonder he was so short of confidence, given the severe lack of service from the supporting cast.",
      "Hojlund was feeding off scraps for most of the 2024/25 campaign and his game had not developed enough to ensure he could score from his one or two chances per game.",
      "Now, Hojlund is one game into his career at a new club and already looks a far stronger prospect through operating in Antonio Conte’s well-drilled 4-1-4-1 formation rather than Amorim’s flawed 3-4-3 system.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has been a bright spark in the No.10 position, but Man Utd’s overall attacking unit are still failing to get their No.9 into the game as Sesko has been on the periphery in his minutes so far.",
      "It is already being reported that Man Utd ‘regret’ signing Sesko, but it is too soon to throw out such suggestions as he is only partly to blame for his early struggles as Amorim’s naive insistence on playing his formation is undermining the striker’s integration.",

When opposition managers start devising game plans to specifically target a goalkeeper from set pieces the writing is so often scribbled indelibly on the wall; not every keeper can transform themselves like David de Gea, and West Ham certainly aren’t in a position to be patient with Hermansen just in case he miraculously does.",

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool but now they have Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone, but it was an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern, as it was in a 1-0 defeat to Fulham.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton and now Newcastle United.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that. But any renewed optimism was dashed by an exposing defeat to Tottenham.",

      "Gotta hand it to Manchester United. In recent years, they’ve truly become the gift that keeps on giving. Rival fans used to have to work for a laugh — now all it takes is a glance at the back pages or a scroll through social media. I mean, was it ever this bleak for their supposed rivals? One went 30 years without a league title, the other nosedived to League One, and still neither descended into the meme-fodder pantomime United have mastered in the post-Fergie era.",
      "Which brings me to Ruben Amorim — or should I say, Agent Amorim?",
      "Now, we’ve all made jokes about certain managers being double agents, sent by rival clubs to sabotage from within. Usually tongue-in-cheek stuff. But with Amorim? Honestly, I’m not so sure anymore. The man’s a masterpiece of incompetence — or covert brilliance, depending how you look at it.",
      "People are piling on the poor guy, but let’s be fair — if a man this determined to get sacked still hasn’t been sacked, then maybe the problem isn’t just the manager, but the clowns upstairs running the circus.",
      "Let’s review the evidence:",
      "Eight PL wins in 31, a goal difference deeper in the red than their balance sheet. That gets you sacked in Sunday league. But at United, it’s just another chapter in the long, miserable saga of delusion over direction.",
      "Every week, the same tactical car crash — not because he doesn’t know better, but because it works… at delivering defeats.",
      "Persistently selecting the same underperforming players week after week, ensuring fans enjoy that sweet, familiar taste of failure.",
      "They didn’t even qualify for Europe this season, so there wasn’t even the dignity of a Thursday night humbling in Moldova to cling to. Instead, they crashed out of the Carabao Cup courtesy of Grimsby Town, and are now left with just one competition to “focus on” — which, hilariously, doesn’t even start until January.",
      "All this after spending over £200 million in the summer — the fifth-highest spenders in Europe — yet somehow forgetting to buy a single competent defender. It’s like going shopping for a winter coat and coming back with five pairs of sunglasses!",
      "And in the middle of it all? Amorim, sat on the bench fiddling with his tactics board, like some abstract artist in the middle of a nervous breakdown. The pièce de résistance? Throwing Harry Maguire up top and calling it a “plan.”",
      "And when the tactical disasters and limp performances weren’t enough, he went full kamikaze in the post-match press conference — all but daring the board to sack him, saying, ‘You can’t change the system, you need to change the man.’ That’s not analysis — that’s a resignation letter read aloud, and they still didn’t take the hint.",
      "I mean… what more does a man have to do?",
      "He’s tanked the derby, served up dross weekly, mugged off his own board on live TV — and yet there he is, still on the payroll. If that’s not a metaphor for United, I don’t know what is.",
      "When Amorim finally gets his marching orders — and let’s be honest, that could still take a while — I, for one, will miss him deeply.\nMr K – God bless you, Ruben. Your services to Manchester City Football Club will never be forgotten",
      "You can see it in his eyes. In his body language. In his stubborn insistence on that formation. He allegedly tried to quit last season when he saw the scale of the rebuild. He didn’t even want to come mid-season. He can see his reputation as a bright young thing disintegrating before his eyes. Why didn’t he do another couple of years in Portugal, maybe off to PSG or Bayern.. Let him go. There’s hope for him, Sir Jim. Don’t make the captain go down with the ship..",
      "Seriously though, I’ve never seen a manager so clearly unhappy with his job. Nuno for instance would turn Man United around within a month or two, even with that squad. Play four at the back, three solid defensive mid, then 3 of Bruno, Amad, Mbuemo, Cunha, Sesko up front. It doesn’t even seem that hard. Is Amorim trying to be sacked?\nDan, London",

      "I am unsurprised by United fans calling for Amorim’s sack. But the real question is who do you want to replace him?",
      "Part of Amorim’s allure was he was a young manager, and he has now basically ruined his reputation with his managing of United. If I was an up-and-coming manager, I wouldn’t go anywhere near that club. It is a basket case. Also, your fans do not have the patience for young managers.",
      "So do you go for an old head? Someone who’s been around the block, but who is an old head and couldn’t see that they’d be inheriting a poison chalice?",

It’d leave De Ligt in the middle on his own marking say Ekitike, so you cant do that. So who marks the wide forwards? Your wing backs, Dorgu and Diallo or Mazroui are taksed with defending and are pretty much nullified as a forward threat. So you’ve got 5 at the back with 3 ctr backs now marking 1 central striker. And still shipping 2-3 goals every game (bar Fulham).",

      "31 points from 31 games is truly awful and proof Amorim’s system, ideas, formation is not working. He won’t change and will be sacked before November. Who’ll touch him after that? Anyone wanting this shite formation? It’ll be really interesting to see who offers him a gig based on what he’s achieved at United because he doesn’t deserve / hasn’t earned anything at all. He’s going to fall on his own sword because he’s stubborn and somehown STILL !! Believes this is the way to play to the point it’s laughable now.",

And it’ll interesting to see how robust Isak’s fitness is.",
      "It’s funny because in days gone by we’d be happy to give players time and let them settle, but we live in a culture these days that sees Gyokeres at Arsenal – who cost half as much as Wirtz – getting stick after an hour against United. Yet there’s barely been a mention of how mediocre Slot’s signings have looked so far. Why the protection for Liverpool?",

I think so, but I can also see us and Liverpool topping 90pts and I cannot contest the level of game winners they have in the biggest moments, so it could be them winning at the death.

      "Man Utd have not started off this season well either, with the Red Devils taking four points from their opening four Premier League matches and are currently 14th in the early-season table.",
      "That has seen Amorim come under mounting pressure and a 3-0 defeat against arch-rivals Man City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday has not helped matters.",
      "There are claims that the Portuguese head coach still has the support of the Man Utd board but that not qualifying for Europe this season would be ‘fatal’ for him.",
      "After the defeat to Man City, Amorim told the media: “When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose.

      "Amorim, whose side put in a good display against Arsenal in the first match of the season, added: “I understand how football is and the results dictate the narrative. Did you think we were the better team against Arsenal? They had [Martin] Odegaard, [Declan] Rice and [Martin] Zubimendi.",

It does not show that Amorim is a WORSE manager than promoted managers Scott Parker or Daniel Farke, or new Brentford boss Keith Andrews, and especially not Ange Postecoglou, who has actually picked up a paltry 25 points from his last 31 Premier League games as manager of Tottenham and Nottingham Forest.",

Because United have made no such ‘decision’, of course. Because clubs do not make ‘decisions’ after every football match. That would be mental.",

      "And then there’s the ‘ultimatum’, possibly the most powerful word of all. It’s defined as ‘a final demand or statement of terms, the rejection of which will result in retaliation or a breakdown in relations’.",
      "So we were surprised to see that Amorim had issued an ‘ultimatum after making fresh sack admission’ in the Mirror. Well, not surprised, more intrigued by how they might have somehow engineered an ‘ultimatum’ out of his comments after the match.",
      "And of course, the answer to that question is that they didn’t; they have decided he ‘set himself a two-year ultimatum to prove he is the right man for the job’ when he was appointed.",
      "You know and we know that you cannot set yourself an ‘ultimatum’; you can set yourself a target, or a deadline, or you can issue an ultimatum to somebody else.",

      "Sunday was the latest of many terrible days for Amorim at Man Utd, with his side on the end of a humbling 3-0 defeat at the hands of arch-rivals Manchester City.",
      "A tight derby was expected, as Man Utd and Man City each had a rough start to the 2025/26 campaign. But Pep Guardiola’s tactical approach exposed Amorim, who is the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, and helped his side earn a resounding victory, with United fortunate to avoid a more embarrassing deficit.",
      "Guardiola brought the game’s standout Jeremy Doku central in an unfamiliar role to outnumber Man Utd’s midfield, and this worked a treat as the flashy winger contributed assists for City’s opening two goals. Erling Haaland, meanwhile, capitalised on United’s shambolic loss of possession to score his second and his side’s third in a dominant display.",
      "This game provided further evidence that Amorim’s failing 3-4-3 system is not fit for purpose, as none of Man Utd’s players look better in this formation than under Erik ten Hag and they remain ineffective all across the pitch.",

      "It seems that this is the case if Romano’s comments are anything to go by; it hardly seems that Amorim has overwhelming backing.",
      "Romano avoided giving a clear answer when asked by GiveMeSport whether ‘Man Utd still have 100% belief?’ He responded: “It’s a difficult moment of course but Amorim wants to give his best for Man United, he’s convinced that with time he will sort things.”",
      "Yes, we know that Amorim will continue to “give his best” and as proven by his bullish but naive comments after the Manchester derby, he’s “convinced that with time he will sort things”, even if he and/or his system is not fit for purpose.",

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 11:40, UK",
      "It is four years ago now that Nicky Butt made headlines for his claim that Declan Rice is no better than Scott McTominay. While Butt acknowledges that the England midfielder has improved since then, there is more respect on McTominay's name now too.",
      "McTominay was the driving force behind Napoli's Serie A title win last season, scoring a dozen goals and winning the competition's player of the year award. It has made a mockery of the notion that he was not good enough to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Scott is an amazing person. He is a really great lad.\" Butt, who made 387 appearances for United, including one in the 1999 Champions League final, knows him well. He was an academy coach at United when McTominay broke through. \"He had it tough,\" he adds.",
      "\"He had a lot of growing problems, a lot of injuries.\" That growth spurt has been well documented. \"Back in the day, he was only small and slight.\" But his great strength was his resolve. \"His determination and his drive, you could not ever question,\" says Butt.",
      "\"Scott would be the first to sit here and say he was not the most gifted and talented footballer on the planet, which I wasn't, Roy Keane wasn't. But when you've got that kind of drive, which Scott has and obviously Roy had, you get yourself through the levels.",
      "\"And that is what Scott has done. Scott had the disappointment of leaving Man Utd, I felt that was wrong to let him go because he is one of your own, he would run through brick walls for you, a Manchester United fan from a family of Manchester United fans.\"",
      "McTominay returns to Manchester this week to play against City in the Champions League on Thursday. United themselves are not in European competition. \"It is the same old thing,\" says Butt. \"You don't know what you have got until you've not got it.\"",
      "He adds: \"He is a god in Napoli now. You go there and his picture is on all the walls. It is great. He has earned all that. He has grafted, worked hard, had knockbacks and fair play to him he is a player now. If he'd stayed, he might have stagnated and never got better.\"",
      "Indeed, Butt believes that even the famous Class of '92 would have struggled in the current climate. He made his Premier League debut alongside Bryan Robson in midfield with Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister behind him, Brian McClair and Mark Hughes ahead.",
      "\"Everybody talks about our group,\" says Butt of a crop of talent that included Paul Scholes and David Beckham. \"If we had been brought into this environment now, you would never have heard of us. We would have played seven, eight, nine or 10 games.\"",
      "Why is that? \"We got brought into a football team that was successful with world-class players but more importantly world-class professionals, good men. They made us, really. Trust me, it was more the fact that we had professionals around,\" he explains.",
      "\"When you come into a football club it is hard enough to put one young lad into a team. If you have not got real men to look after you then you will struggle. If we had got into this group now together, we would not have survived, we would have had a nightmare.\"",
      "Nicky Butt came close to making his own move abroad in 2004 when he was a target for Real Madrid. \n\n\n“I had a conversation with the club and they said that if you can find the right club for yourself and Manchester United then you can go. So I started looking around. Carlos Queiroz was Real Madrid manager at the time, he wanted me.”\n\n\nButt went as far as getting a passport sorted for his dog. “I am a big dog man so I made sure they were coming straight away. But it never transpired.” Sir Alex Ferguson decided to block the move.\n\n\n“Player power was not around then but even if it was I was not the kind of bloke to kick up too much of a fuss. I went to Newcastle which was an amazing club and I enjoyed my time there.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the launch of his new podcast with Scholes, The Good, The Bad and The Football, United's ongoing malaise is a recurring theme of the conversation. Having worked in United's academy between 2012 and 2021, Butt saw this unfolding up close.",
      "It remains a source of frustration. \"The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand,\" he says of City's rise to become the destination of choice in Manchester. \"Kids saw other clubs coming to them with better facilities. It was a massive pull for them.",
      "\"All over the country, academies upped their game. At Manchester United, we got a bit lacklustre, thinking we were the biggest and the best and did not have to go out and do all the things that the others were doing, but you have to stay on top of your game.\"",
      "Given his prominent role, could he not have arrested that slide himself? \"You're a small cog in a big machine.\" In 2021, he walked away. \"There were things happening at the club where there were people with different philosophies to what I was brought up on.\"",
      "An example. The separation between the academy and the senior players annoyed him. \"Young kids are moving further away from the first team,\" he says. \"I did not agree with the idea that the first team gets everything there and everyone else is on the other side.\"",
      "It was far removed from his own experience as a young player. \"When I was coming into the first team, I knew Brian Robson. I knew Mark Hughes. I knew Peter Schmeichel. I knew Brian McClair. All these superstars that you have on your wall,\" he says.",
      "\"Three years earlier I was at school. But I knew them because I was having dinner with them every day. I was training with them every day. And there was one big family. And when you go into the first team, they know your name and you know how they play.",
      "\"I could not ever imagine playing in front of 75,000 people and not even knowing who these people are. I think they have got to be a lot more together, a lot tighter. And my way, I felt, was changing. That was because other people were coming in from outside.\"",
      "If the sense is of Butt being wistful about United's past, do not mistake him for a sentimentalist. His take on the prospect of the club's proud record of having an academy graduate in every squad for 83 years and counting might just surprise.",
      "\"I'm a bit 50-50 with that. Unless you are bringing players in who are going to play for the club for years, it's pointless because anybody can put someone on the bench from the academy. They don't have to be good enough, it is just to keep the tradition going.",

      "Paul Merson pens his latest column on Ruben Amorim's struggles at Manchester United, Arsenal's Premier League title hopes, Noni Madueke's form, Liverpool's interesting  start to the season and Aston Villa's struggles",
      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 09:46, UK",
      "Paul Merson says Ruben Amorim must adapt his tactics at Manchester United to improve his \"unthinkable\" record.",
      "Also, The Magic Man discusses Arsenal's Premier League title hopes after their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest and Liverpool's interesting start to the season after Mohamed Salah's late penalty got them out of jail at Burnley.",
      "Read on for Merson's thoughts in full...",
      "Ruben Amorim, the way he wants to play, is a worry.",
      "He won't change. He'll look at it and say 'I've got where I am today by playing the way I play', using three at the back and high wing-backs.",
      "He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world-class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto, they've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "You look at Man United and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near it, nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.",
      "You've got to be able to change now and then. You can tweak it, it's horses for courses, that doesn't mean you are abandoning your beliefs.",
      "I don't see them finishing anywhere near it this season, there's too much work to be done. They haven't got the quality.",
      "They were decent against Burnley, but it ends up 2-2 and they need a penalty in the last minute. Their best two players are Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha, they cannot afford to be missed.",
      "He still hasn't won back-to-back games in the league, nearly a year in. That's unthinkable for a club like Man Utd. Unthinkable.",
      "I just wish he would change it every now and then and adapt to the personnel he's got available. It's worrying because he doesn't know his best team, the back three don't even play together every week. He's been there a year, that's a big, big worry.",
      "It's a hard week for Arsenal.",
      "I thought they played really well against Nottingham Forest, a solid result. The performance showed their depth. No Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice was a sub, Martin Odegaard had to go off - it just showed their quality.",
      "If they get through these next couple of weeks, I see them as the team. They are the ones. If they get through these next couple of games, you go advantage Arsenal. They have got ample quality to win the league.",
      "They were very good against Liverpool. That's the most comfortable I've seen an Arsenal team at Anfield in 20 years. If it had ended 0-0 we would be saying 'who is going to touch Arsenal this season?'. Liverpool didn't look like scoring for toffee and then Dominik Szoboszlai scores a worldie from nothing.",
      "Noni Madueke needs to keep on performing, it's only just started.",
      "Arsenal play a certain way, he's been positive, but the way Arsenal play compared to Chelsea will suit him.",
      "Arsenal move the ball quicker, it goes into his feet quicker and then he's one-vs-one in a flash. Chelsea are slower, by the time the ball is moved out to the winger the other side have doubled up. Arsenal don't do that.",
      "He's done outstanding so far - his goal for England against Serbia was really good - better than what I thought. But this has got to go on for the rest of the season. So far, so good.",
      "I'm unsure about Liverpool. They should be mid-table. They've been gifted six points.",
      "They never looked like scoring against Arsenal, Newcastle last kick of the game, then Burnley a penalty in stoppage time. What Hannibal Mejbri is doing there I do not know. You could take six points off Liverpool and no one would have argued. No one would say 'oh that's a bit harsh, they were bang unlucky'. All three should have ended up as draws, and they would be mid-table.",
      "I'm not convinced yet. There is a lot of work for Arne Slot to do. I don't think this Florian Wirtz one is working. I like Wirtz, a terrific player, but teams are sitting back against Liverpool and it's so claustrophobic for him. Their midfield three, for me, won them the league last year. I thought Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai were outstanding for long parts, dominating midfields - I don't see that this season. Teams are getting at Liverpool.",
      "Alexander Isak has got to come in, you can have all the best players in the world but if they don't gel, it doesn't work. So they could be mid-table, but you could also say they haven't started playing yet and they have won every game. That's the sign of a very good team.",
      "It's not like Aston Villa have been unlucky, you can't say they have been peppering opposition goals and been unlucky not to score. It's a slow burner. It's shocked me, I thought they would be right up there. It's worrying times.",
      "They will be okay because I think the manager is outstanding, but they have been caught behind. They didn't bring in a forward, Ollie Watkins looks lost. Hopefully one comes off his backside and he goes on a run but Villa don't look like scoring and that's the worry.",
      "They don't look right. A lot of stuff happened in the market - clubs spent, Villa didn't. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were taken away, goals have dried up. And these are players that can make chances for other people as well, they aren't getting those anymore. I look at that Villa team and it doesn't inspire me.",
      "I'm a big fan of Unai Emery, and so if anyone can turn it around, he can.",

      "Between the Lines returns with an in-depth look at Ruben Amorim's system and the reasons why Man Utd are struggling to make it work; Sunday's 3-0 loss to Man City leaves them with a worse record than any ever-present Premier League side since last year",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 10:14, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "Between the Lines returns with a look at his approach, a breakdown of how formations have evolved in the Premier League, and an examination of the system's issues at Manchester United.",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",
      "Grealish, who had a season-high 16 touches in the opposition box in Everton's goalless draw with Aston Villa, still ranks second for chances created from open play in the Premier League so far this season, but the one man ahead of him on that list is Doku.",
      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",
      "Brentford's stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea was finished by Fabio Carvalho but it came from a Kevin Schade long throw. According to the expected-goals data, the Bees have now created better chances from throw-ins than any other team this season.",
      "No surprise there. That was the case last season, and the season before that, and the season before that, and the season before that. Other teams are finally cottoning on to the fact that the throw-in is an opportunity to do more than just recycle possession.",
      "\"It is not new to us,\" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. How true. Over the past five seasons, their expected-goals tally from throw-ins is 21.47. The next best in the Premier League in that period is just 5.49 by Nottingham Forest. The rest are playing catch up.",
      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",

      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."

      "Ruben Amorim forced to defend system once again as he refuses to deviate from favoured formation; Man United lost 3-0 to Man City in the derby, as Amorim's side suffer worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim said he accepts \"any decision\" taken in the wake of Manchester United's latest punishing defeat, this time in the Manchester derby, as his record at the club took another significant hit.",
      "United's four points from as many games this season means the club have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, while Amorim himself now has the unenviable record of the worst win percentage of any Man Utd boss since the Second World War.",
      "To make matters worse, and illustrate the situation most starkly, since Amorim was appointed last November, United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference.",
      "\"The performance was not good,\" he said after a 3-0 defeat to Man City. \"In the important moments, they were better than us.",
      "\"I'm trying to be rational. I see the record. I understand the frustration and I understand the decisions that come with that. I take the critics. That's it.\"",
      "When asked what message he might have for angered fans, many of whom left well before the final whistle at the Etihad, he said: \"My message? I will do everything. Always thinking about what is best for the club.",
      "\"Until I'm here, I'll do my best. The rest is not my decision. I'm suffering more [than the fans].\"",
      "Much of the criticism levelled at Amorim involves the rigidity of his 3-4-2-1 system, and his vow never to deviate from a framework that, so far, has served his players poorly.",
      "Both balance and consistency are proving tough to come by, but the Portuguese was resolute in defence of his style once again after the derby defeat.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"And we talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that in the system or whatever. So I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change it.",
      "\"I understand how football is and the results dictate the narrative. I see it that way. I know that is hard for people. The fans do not want to hear these things. I don't lie to myself. I see the record and I accept any decision.\"",
      "\"I think there will be some pressure applied to the manager and his rigidity of sticking with the system,\" said Neville about the ramifications of the loss to City.",
      "\"City have beaten them well and comfortably. United had some good moments in the game - the first 15 minutes and the first five minutes of the second half. City, in big moments, have had better players. Foden, Doku, Haaland have stood out.",
      "\"There have been times when I have seen United lose this type of match when I feel angry and frustrated.",
      "\"I just feel nothing, which is even worse. This has been a nothing of a performance. United have just been beaten.",
