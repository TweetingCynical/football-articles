      "Manchester United want Ruben Amorim to remain in charge at Old Trafford, and the 40-year-old has no plans to step down as head coach. It appears it would take a severe result against Sunderland to change that stance going into the international break.",
      "Speculation over Amorim's future has been bountiful following last weekend's 3-1 defeat to Brentford. United have proven unconvincing so far this season.",
      "The Red Devils have won just two of their opening seven matches across all competitions and sit 14th in the Premier League. They have recorded just seven points after also finishing 15th last term.",
      "Ahead of Sunderland's visit to the Theatre of Dreams, talk amounted over the risk to Amorim's position should United be defeated. The Black Cats have made a promising start since returning to the Premier League, winning three and drawing two of their six games.",
      "Speaking to NBC Sports, David Ornstein suggested it is far from certain Amorim would be sacked after a loss, as long as the result wasn't too severe. There is an expectation he will keep his job.",
      "It is said United retain faith in the Portuguese, who is determined to turn the club's fortunes around. Both parties know results must improve, but the squad is also noted to back the head coach.",
      "The finances involved with sacking Amorim are claimed not to be a factor in any decision taken over Amorim's future.",
      "If a change is made, Gareth Southgate is not expected to be a candidate in any search. The 55-year-old has been out of work since resigning as England manager in July 2024.",
      "Amorim has admitted he is expecting a \"really tough match\" against Sunderland. The Black Cats were 1-0 winners at Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "\"It's going to be a really tough match, they are doing really well,\" Amorim said. \"And then, when you see the games, they draw with one less player in the final [moments] of the game, they draw, [get] one point, and then they win in the final play against Brentford, [to get] another three points.",
      "\"I think the details are changing the table a lot, so we need to pay attention to that. It’s a team that plays really well, it’s a clear 4-3-3 system with a lot of rotations in the side of the pitch.",
      "\"They are confident and they know that we are going to be under pressure and we need to be able to play with that and we are prepared for a tough, tough match.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Football commentary legend Clive Tyldesley believes Ruben Amorim needs to show a greater flexibility if he wants to turn things around at Manchester United. Amorim's persistence with his 3-4-3 approach has yet to deliver results in the league, to the point that Saturday's home meeting with Sunderland is a real pressure game.",
      "Amorim led United to the Europa League final last season, but defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao ensured his team aren't in Europe this term. That means the pressure is inescapable ahead of every single league outing - especially after a shock defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup - and defeat to the newly promoted Black Cats could spell the end.",
      "\"I can't help but feel, and I wouldn't say it any stronger than that, if that if Amorim had not been a little bit more pragmatic and a little bit more practical with the resources that he inherited, and was a little bit more patient in terms of imposing his ideas and his ways upon the club, than actually Manchester United could even have qualified for a Europa League place last season from the position that he inherited,\" Tyldesley says.",
      "\"As it was, they reached the Europa League final, and very nearly, I guess, the Champions League. But I think realistically, they had a long way to come this season.",
      "\"I think the recruitment has been better and that he has some very good forward players at his disposal, but the balance of the team is still uncomfortable and the insistence on sticking to his ideas is difficult to justify when arguably the finest coach in our league at the moment, Pep Guardiola, who himself has very clear ideas on how the game has played, has shown himself to be prepared to be adaptable in order to improve results within his team. \"",
      "It's not just Guardiola who has shown that kind of adaptability. Liverpool mixed up their style under Arne Slot last season, adopting a stingier defensive approach when needed, and it resulted in the Dutch coach winning the league at the first time of asking.",
      "\"I think that Arne Slot was the most adaptable of all the managers in the Premier League last season,\" Tyldesley adds. \"Liverpool played with a little bit of everything. They went long, they went short. They defended deep when they had to. They'd go 4-4-2 when they want to see out a game. I mean, he is not frightened to try anything that he thinks will work in order to get the points.\"",
      "That's not to say Amorim has been afraid to try new things. The head coach was criticised for his use of Mason Mount in the defeat at Brentford, and there have been other ways in which he has attempted to be creative with the talents at his disposal.",
      "Tyldesley welcomes that willingness to mix things up - the question for him is whether Amorim is picking the right environment to try them out. \"My final point on this is that if you paint a picture of an experiment or a project that is a long term project and ask the fans to bear with you because this will bear fruit in the long term, then it begs the question of whether you can still charge them 70 quid to watch the team while you're having the experiment,\" he adds.",
      "\"The famous comedians of the UK often try out their material in small theatres and sometimes pubs before they take it to the Apollo and the O2 and to a mass audience. They don't charge as much when they're trying out their material, as they do when it's the finished product.",
      "\"That might seem a rather strange analogy, but there were games last season when you felt as if this was something that could be done at Carrington, really, rather than in front of 70,000 people at Old Trafford who were going to have to trudge away with another defeat for the money that they'd paid.",
      "\"And that would be my question mark against him. If 3-4-3 or 3-4-2-1 was the magic bullet, then every team that had won the World Cup and every team that's won the Champions League in the last 10 years would have played that system, and they didn't.\"",
      "Clive Tyldesley is raising awareness of The Football Association’s Silent Support Weekend. For more information, please visit https://www.englandfootball.com/participate/behaviour/Silent-Support.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United seem to be in a constant state of turmoil, with crises becoming a regular occurrence in recent years. The wave of optimism that washed over the club following an encouraging pre-season and several high-profile signings seems like a distant memory.",
      "Despite a narrow 1-0 loss to Arsenal on the opening day offering some positives, the subsequent disappointments have far outweighed any initial hope. Ruben Amorim's tactical decisions continue to draw scrutiny, and a loss against Sunderland today could force the United board to reconsider his position as manager.",
      "Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir is expected to retain his spot between the sticks for the Premier League match. He made a few commendable saves against Brentford last week, but was criticised for his handling of Mathias Jensen's added-time goal.",
      "United's defence appeared shaky at the Gtech Community Stadium, prompting calls for their top defender, Leny Yoro, to return to the starting line-up alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw.",
      "Amad is back in contention after missing last week's defeat due to a family bereavement. However, given Amorim's typically conservative team selections, it remains to be seen whether he will start or be named among the substitutes, potentially making way for Diogo Dalot.",
      "Casemiro is set to return to the starting line-up following his suspension, with Bruno Fernandes expected to join him in midfield and Patrick Dorgu taking up a position on the left wing.",
      "Last week saw Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo start together for the first time, showing promising signs. Sesko netted his debut goal for United, while Mbeumo and Cunha combined to win a penalty, unfortunately missed by Fernandes.",
      "The trio are likely to be given another chance to impress as they aim to build on their encouraging first outing together.",

      "With manager Ruben Amorim feeling the heat, the upcoming clash with the Black Cats could prove crucial for his future. Fresh off the back of a 3-1 loss to Brentford last week, Amorim will be banking on his squad's ability to bounce back and secure a win.",
      "However, they're up against a formidable Sunderland side, led by Regis Le Bris, who are currently enjoying a four-match unbeaten streak. The newly-promoted team have already notched up three wins, two draws and just one loss this season, letting in only four goals. Only Arsenal and Crystal Palace can claim a better defensive record.",
      "Despite the match shaping up to be a thrilling encounter, UK fans will unfortunately miss out on live coverage as it won't be televised. We have all the details you need ahead of the match, including timings and how to catch the action if you're overseas.",
      "It's the first time the two teams will lock horns since April 2017 when United clinched a 3-0 victory over them at the Stadium of Light. That season marked the end of Sunderland's decade-long stint in the Premier League as they ended up in the 20th spot and suffered relegation.",
      "While fans based in the UK are left out in the cold for 3pm kick-offs, the blackout rule doesn't apply to supporters worldwide. For instance, Peacock will broadcast the match live in the United States.",
      "If there's a craving for extended highlights, Match of the Day is scheduled from 10:30pm on BBC One on Saturday night. The programme can also be viewed on iPlayer from 8pm on Saturday.",
      "Amorim will be heartened by the comebacks of Casemiro and Amad Diallo, both of whom sat out last week's 3-1 loss to Brentford. The Brazilian was missing after receiving a red card against Chelsea, while the Ivorian missed the game due to family commitments.",
      "Diallo has made a return to training on Wednesday and is now in the running to play against his former team, for whom he netted 14 goals in 42 appearances during the 2022/23 season. Lisandro Martinez remains the only long-term injury concern for United as he continues his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury.",
      "However, Noussair Mazraoui will be out of action until after the international break due to a thigh injury. Tyrell Malacia, who was part of United's infamous 'bomb squad' this summer, has been welcomed back into first-team activities by Amorim.",

      "Manchester United faced a horrific ordeal before a woeful display against Sunderland in October 2010. The club were forced to bundle a dressing room packed with soiled clothes into bin bags as Sir Alex Ferguson's team managed only a draw at the Stadium of Light.",
      "United manager Ruben Amorim will be hoping to revive his team's campaign against the Black Cats on Saturday. Yet even Ferguson's best preparations couldn't have readied the United squad for the situation they encountered on Wearside 15 years ago.",
      "United entered the changing room to discover a bucket catching a leak from above, but it rapidly spiralled into catastrophe. Shortly after the players had changed and ventured out for their pre-match warm-up, United were told the leak had deteriorated and returned to witness a ruptured pipe flooding the room with sewage.",
      "Fortunately, club kit manager Albert Morgan had brought backup kits for the players. Referee Chris Foy postponed the match by 20 minutes as United endured a tedious 0-0 stalemate. Nevertheless, the players' clothes were beyond rescue, with Morgan recalling Dimitar Berbatov's fury at losing a pair of shoes.",
      "\"We'd been out there [warming up] for a few minutes and one of the security guards came and said: 'Albert, I think you'd better come in the dressing room, that bucket's getting a bit full,'\" Morgan recalled on the UTD podcast in 2020. \"By the time we got back in the changing room, the bucket had been changed to a bin.",
      "\"Well, we walked in and they had these ceiling tiles, before you could say 'whip', one of the ceiling tiles just burst out. S*** everywhere! The gaffer just got out.",
      "\"It was all over the suits, the clothes, up the walls, up the ceiling. Berbatov was going mad about his shoes. His shoes had just sunk in three inches of s***.",
      "\"You couldn't save a thing. Everything was gone - shoes, suits. The only thing we could do was go into the lads' socks and shoes to get the jewellery and watches. This is 10 to three. The game kicks off at three. Shirts are all splattered in s***. They had to put the game back half an hour. All the players were saying I'm not playing in that.\"",
      "The horrific scenario then took an extraordinary turn as Sunderland manager and United legend Steve Bruce turned up to clear the carnage before kick-off. Morgan recalled the former United skipper's arrival on the scene to assist Ferguson's squad.",
      "\"He came in through a door at the back of the dressing room,\" Morgan said. \"He had this brush, it must have been 14-foot wide. And there's big Brucey coming in at the back just shovelling this s*** out of the dressing room. We just put the suits in black bags and destroyed the lot!\"",
      "Bruce managed to find humour in the chaos, suggesting it had all been a calculated scheme to finally triumph against his former boss. \"I've been trying for 15 years to beat him and today we even sabotaged the toilets,\" the Sunderland manager quipped. He continued: \"Alex was very complimentary about us. He didn't enjoy the toilet trouble he had but he did enjoy the red wine.\"",
      "As for Ferguson, the United manager refused to blame the incident after his side secured a draw for the third occasion in four league fixtures. United would shortly bounce back to form and ultimately clinched the Premier League crown by nine points.",
      "After the Sunderland draw, Ferguson said: \"It disrupted us a little bit but not much. Did Sunderland play well? You have to give them credit. They have a fantastic record at home and our back four had to be outstanding today. We've had some difficult games away from home so far and not losing a goal here was important.\"",

      "Former England striker Peter Crouch believes Gareth Southgate could be just what Manchester United need if they decide to part ways with Ruben Amorim. Portuguese coach Amorim is under extreme pressure less than a year since he took charge at Old Trafford, and Crouch believes the cultural changes Southgate brought in with the national team could help turn things around.",
      "Amorim boasts fewer points per game than any other United boss in Premier League history, and last weekend's defeat at Brentford prompted more questions over his future. Southgate's name has been one of those mentioned, and Crouch can see the logic.",
      "\"I love Gareth [and] he's had some stick unfairly,\" Crouch said. \"He took us to the finals. It was frustrating, you know, not to get over the line [but] if he won one game, then would there be a statue of him.",
      "\"He's gone from a statue to people thinking he's not good enough for the Man United job. It's such a fine line in football. I think he's someone that could build something there. You keep getting managers over that are here for the short of term like I think Gareth Southgate is someone who can build something big.\"",
      "Crouch believes Amorim's time could well be up if United lose to Sunderland to leave themselves with seven points from seven games. And, if the higher-ups agree a change is needed, he is confident Southgate ticks the boxes.",
      "\"Is he the sexy manager the Man United fans want? Maybe not, but, you know, what he did, he built a club atmosphere, which at times was not like that [with England],\" Crouch continued. \"He built a relationship between the press and the public, with the team... and if he can do that with England, I think he can do that with Man United.",
      "\"The disconnect between the fans and the team is the biggest I've ever seen it. And he's proven that he can kind of bring that back and create an atmosphere where the players want to go and play.",
      "\"They [his England players] felt like they were a club and they enjoyed going to England camps. And if you look at the players now, they don't look like they're enjoying it at United, and if he can create that kind of harmony, again it's not to be sniffed at.\"",
      "England were at a low ebb when Southgate took over from Sam Allardyce, initially on an interim basis, just months after a Euro 2016 exit at the hands of Iceland under Roy Hodgson. It took just one tournament cycle for changes to begin, though, and the Three Lions followed their run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals by reaching the Euros finals in 2021 and 2024.",
      "It might take United longer to climb back to the upper reaches of the Premier League, but Crouch feels the last decade at Old Trafford points to something deeper than just one manager struggling. \"[Jose] Mourinho, [Louis] Van Gaal, David Moyes, they're not bad managers, right? They've proven that after they've left the club,\" he added.",
      "\"It feels like there's something rotten within the dressing room, maybe higher up, and has that been addressed now, who knows? We're not seeing it on the pitch, but there's something at Manchester United where it's just not been working since Alex Ferguson left. and that needs addressing.\"",
      "He accepted comparisons might be drawn with England's situation in 2016: \"It wasn't good is what I'm saying. There was a total disconnect between the fans and the nation and there is that with Man United, there are some parallels between them.\"",

      "I’ll start this by saying this is what I would do, rather than what I think Amorim will actually go with. In all likelihood, he has lived by the 3-4-2-1 sword…and will die by it as well.",
      "But why go out wondering? A newly promoted team - albeit one in good form - at home, seems as good a time as any to rip it all up.",
      "I’d go 4-2-3-1 and finally allow your best players to play in the best positions. First of all, I’m ending the Altay Bayindir experiment, Senne Lammens in goal.",
      "Then a back four of Diogo Dalot, Mathijs De Ligt, Leny Yoro and Patrick Dorgu. And then in midfield, swallow your pride and start Kobbie Mainoo…there’s just no way he can’t improve on what we’ve seen. He can start next to Casemiro to add a solid base, allowing Bruno Fernandes to join Matheus Cunha on the left, Bryan Mbeumo on the right and Benjamin Sesko up top. It may not work, but at least he’s tried it.",
      "Ben’s Man Utd XI (4-2-3-1): Lammes; Dalot, De Ligt, Yoro, Dorgu; Mainoo, Casemiro; Cunha, Fernandes, Mbeumo; Sesko..",
      "We all know Ruben Amorim isn’t about to abandon his formation, so were I in charge then a bit of pragmatism would be the order of the day. What’s glaringly obvious to me is that United need to get their best player in his best position.",
      "That means plonking Bruno Fernandes in a No.10 position, rather than wasting him further back. Benjamin Sesko can come off the bench as an impact sub, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo cutting in from the flanks and rotating into central positions when Fernandes vacates the space.",
      "The midfield balance is the biggest issue that needs addressing, but how? Casemiro’s lack of mobility is there for all to see, but play him alongside Kobbie Mainoo and (maybe) his experience and ball-winning nous begins to shine.",
      "Amad is back from compassionate leave and can overlap Mbeumo on the right. Matthijs de Ligt was dreadful against Brentford so makes way for Leny Yoro and it’s about time Senne Lammens get his debut because Altay Bayindir has done nothing to convince in goal.",
      "Felix’s Man Utd XI (3-4-3): Lammens; Yoro, Maguire, Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Mainoo, Dorgu; Fernandes, Mbeumo, Cunha.",
      "I'll play devils advocate here. Manchester United were poor against Brentford but I have seen signs of life during some of their other performances, particularly at the start of the season. He's already made it clear he's not for moving on the formation debate, so I'll stick to the same shape.",
      "The midfield is the issue for me. Bruno Fernandes is wasted in a deeper role, so I'd play him where he thrives: in one of the dual No 10 roles. That opens up a space for Kobbie Mainoo alongside Casemiro in the engine room while giving Fernandes license to pull the strings alongside Matheus Cunha. Bryan Mbeumo has been the most eye-catching of United's summer signings and can play centrally, so he gets the nod just ahead of Benjamin Sesko up front.",
      "In goal, now is as good a time as any to blood Senne Lammens and I'd be bringing Leny Yoro into the back three.",
      "Dan's Man Utd XI (3-4-3): Lammens; Yoro, Maguire, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Mainoo, Dorgu; Fernandes, Cunha, Mbeumo.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United take on Sunderland in the Premier League this weekend, with Ruben Amorim’s side desperately seeking a much-needed win. United come into this fixture in poor form, having suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brentford in their most recent outing—a result that continues a worrying trend of disappointing performances and results. The Red Devils have now won just two and lost three of their last five matches across all competitions, and doubts about the viability of Amorim’s project at Old Trafford are reaching a critical point.",
      "There is some encouragement to be found in United’s home record, as they have won two of their three matches at Old Trafford this season, including a victory over Chelsea. Nevertheless, the pressure is mounting, and the team will be under intense scrutiny as they take to the pitch this weekend.",
      "Sunderland, by contrast, arrive in excellent shape, with three wins, two draws, and only one defeat from their opening six games. The Black Cats are unbeaten in their last four matches, with two wins and two draws, and most recently secured their first away victory of the season—a 1-0 triumph at Nottingham Forest. That result will give them plenty of belief as they head to Manchester.",
      "Recent trends suggest this could be an open and entertaining contest. Both teams have scored in five of United’s last six games in all competitions, while Sunderland have found the net in four of their six matches this season. United’s defensive frailties are evident, having conceded 12 goals in their last five outings, which could make for a high-scoring affair.",
      "With pressure mounting on Ruben Amorim and time running out to turn things around, United are in desperate need of three points. Their solid home form may give them hope of avoiding defeat, but a confident, well-organized, and technically proficient Sunderland side will fancy their chances of coming away from Old Trafford with a positive result.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly considering Darren Fletcher as a potential replacement should they decide to part ways with current boss Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese manager is under increasing pressure following United's disappointing start to the Premier League season.",
      "This weekend's home match against Sunderland is due to put further scrutiny on Amorim, who has managed only 18 victories in his 49 games in charge. Despite the mounting pressure, it is understood that he still retains the backing of the Old Trafford board.",
      "However, a loss to Sunderland could prompt Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe to face tough questions during the international break.",
      "According to The Sun, Fletcher has entered the frame to take over as United's interim manager if Amorim goes.",
      "Michael Carrick might have been considered for the role, having previously filled it, but he has recently taken up a new position with UEFA.",
      "The report suggests that, unlike when Erik ten Hag was under scrutiny, United have not lined up any candidates to replace Amorim. Dismissing the 40-year-old would reportedly cost the club £12million in compensation.",
      "Fletcher took over as the Reds' Under-18s coach this summer, and his two sons, Tyler and Jack, have since been promoted to the U-21s.",
      "He is said to have made a significant impact behind the scenes at Carrington, instilling his United DNA into the young squad.",
      "Club insiders have reportedly been impressed by Fletcher's dazzling work ethic and believe the Scot is destined to become a top-flight manager.",
      "Amorim, however, is adamant that the team's fortunes will change. The coach said during his latest pre-match press conference: \"We already talked about that. We had some moments, if you see during these six games, during this season, we are not always the same team in the small things.",
      "\"More in the way we play, all the effort that we put [in], the maximum effort that we put in every single thing, is not the same in different matches. We have to find that balance; it will change everything for us.\"",
      "He added: \"It's not the time to say; it's time to show. Again, I can look at the games this year and, for me, they are completely different.",
      "\"There are some things that are the same, and that is nothing about the position on the pitch, the way we put the ball [in], it's other things that we cannot change. We show that thing in certain games.",
      "\"In the other games, we are not the same team in some details. I have nothing to say in this moment. My job is to prepare the team, and let's go for the next game.\"",

      "The Red Devils have only managed to secure two victories from their first six Premier League matches, suffering three losses in the process. United's 3-1 loss to Brentford in the Premier League last weekend has only fuelled the rumour mill regarding Amorim's future at the club.",
      "Several names have been thrown into the hat as potential successors should Amorim depart during the current season.",
      "Since taking the reins at Bournemouth in 2023, Iraola has garnered much praise for his tactical abilities and influence on the Cherries.",

      "Gary Lineker has heaped praise on Manchester United loan duo Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund following their impressive Champions League displays on Wednesday evening. Rashford, 27, maintained his superb recent run with an assist for Barcelona in their clash with Paris Saint-Germain. The England star delivered a pinpoint pass to former Manchester City striker Ferran Torres, who coolly finished past the PSG goalkeeper.",
      "Following a sluggish beginning to his spell in Catalonia, Rashford has now netted twice and registered five assists across his previous six outings under Hansi Flick. Looking back at Rashford's Barcelona journey so far, Lineker believes it has been \"encouraging\" to witness him featuring regularly for his new team.",
      "Speaking on the Rest Is Football podcast, he said: \"I think Marcus has started well at Barcelona. He's getting a lot of football. People were saying, 'he's not going to get a game.'",
      "\"Obviously you're always going to get little knocks and injuries to certain players, and he seems to be rotating quite a lot, but Marcus has started a lot of games in the Champions League.",
      "\"Of the three goals that Barcelona have scored, he scored two of them and assisted the other one– really good pass. Good start, I think it's encouraging. You can see they really like him.",
      "\"Even at the weekend– I mean his assist at the weekend was in the league, it was a corner, but all the players ran to him. It's a really good sign. You need that. I'm pleased.\"",
      "As for Hojlund, he netted twice for Napoli during their 2-1 triumph over Sporting CP. The Danish striker opened his account after latching onto a superb delivery from Kevin De Bruyne before slotting past the keeper.",
      "De Bruyne then provided another assist as his delivery was nodded home by Hojlund for his second of the evening, wrapping up a triumphant night for Antonio Conte's men.",
      "Hojlund has bagged three goals in five outings for Napoli since his switch from United, with his other strike coming on his bow against Fiorentina.",
      "\"I know De Bruyne was brilliant in the game as well yesterday, but Rasmus Hojlund scored two goals,\" Lineker added. \"Everybody who is leaving Manchester United seems to be doing really well. But it just shows you, doesn't it?\".",
      "Both Rashford and Hojlund departed United on loan in the summer, with Antony and Jadon Sancho amongst the others to exit the Reds after Ruben Amorim made it clear they were not in his plans.",

      "This was their third loss in six matches, completely draining the momentum built up from a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at home. Rooney didn't hold back in his critique of the current squad, claiming many players were not worthy of wearing the United shirt.",
      "However, football pundits Lineker and Shearer weren't entirely in agreement with the former England and United captain.",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Lineker began by saying: \"I heard Wayne Rooney the other day being very critical of the players at Manchester United, saying they're not doing enough.",
      "\"I don't know, I just think when a club's in turmoil or when it's a bit rotten that it's not necessarily just about the players' attitudes. No one ever steps out onto a football pitch without total commitment. I mean, it's very, very rare.\"",
      "Shearer agreed with his former Match of the Day colleague, adding: \"It's been a tough environment to play at Manchester United for the last few years, and clearly now it's a tough place to go out and play. Even more so now I guess with what's going on.",
      "\"You hear the manager week in, week out, it's the same old, this, this and this, and nothing is changing. It's a tough place to play at the minute that ground, and the evidence suggests that, as you say, when anyone ever leaves they go on to do really well.",
      "\"I mean, McTominay, Hojlund, Antony, Rashford– I guess Sancho hasn't, but the majority of the players that go out, and whether they leave permanently or whether they're on loan, they seem to go and shine, don't they?\"",
      "On his BBC podcast, Rooney had said: \"This is not Man United. I don't recognise the whole football club. I don't see players fighting. I don't see character. I don't see a desire to win. I don't see ability. I don't see match winners.",
      "\"Nothing gets me off my feet. I go into a game watching, expecting, 'Okay, here we go again,' expecting the team to lose or maybe pick up a point. This is not Man United.",
      "He continued: \"I was at the football club for 13 years, and what is going on is not right. And this is not all on the manager, by the way. I'm seeing players, they're not deserving to wear that shirt, and it hurts.",
      "\"When you've been at a football club for that long and you care for the club, this is not acceptable what is going on. Man United haven't won back-to-back games for I don't know how long.\"",
      "While acknowledging the players bear some responsibility, Shearer and Lineker weren't quite as harsh as Rooney in their assessment.",
      "United are set to face Sunderland at Old Trafford in what could be another tricky match for Amorim's squad.",
      "Despite being the new kids on the block, the Black Cats are tipped by some as slight favourites, having climbed to fifth place after notching up three wins, two draws and just one defeat in their opening six Premier League games.",

      "Antony has no regrets about his time at Manchester United, despite enduring a challenging period both on and off the pitch.",
      "After being deemed surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim, Antony joined Real Betis in the second half of last season, marking a fresh start for him. The Brazilian winger scored nine goals in 26 appearances during the second half of the season, helping Betis reach the Conference League final.",
      "Upon his return to England, Antony was placed in the 'bomb squad', training away from the first-team squad. He was also not part of the club's pre-season friendlies. It wasn't until the final days of the transfer window that he secured a permanent move to Betis.",
      "In a sit-down interview with ESPN Brasil, the winger was asked whether he would have changed anything about his spell at United.",
      "\"Look, I don't think so, because, like I said, everything has a 'why,' [a purpose] he said.",
      "\"If I went there, it was because God wanted me to be there, to learn and to go through the things I went through. Today, I feel a much better man as well as a father.",
      "\"Before I signed for United, yes, I was close to signing for Liverpool. Everything has a why and I don't just look at the negative times I had there, because I also won titles and had great experiences. So, I don't regret it.\"",
      "Arriving at Old Trafford with a €100million (£86m) price tag, Antony failed to live up to expectations, and many questioned whether the fee affected his performances for the club.",
      "\"I knew about the responsibility I had because of that price tag, but I also knew I had done a lot to deserve that,\" he confessed.",
      "\"I tried to not look or focus on that but as I said before, I think a lot of things off the pitch hurt me a lot so I ended up not performing as well as I could have.\"",

      "Sir David Beckham is showing no signs of slowing down after turning 50 as the Manchester United legend takes on a new role ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The former England captain has kept himself extremely busy since retiring from playing in 2013.",
      "He has worked on charitable causes through a number of different campaigns, launched several brands, continued his modelling career and even formed his own football team, Inter Miami.",
      "The iconic No. 7 has now teamed up with Verizon, the World Cup's official telecommunications partner, for their 360 marketing campaign before the tournament kicks off in the USA, Mexico and Canada next year. The scheme will provide their customers with thousands of complimentary match tickets, while hundreds more will win the chance to enjoy pitchside access during the tournament.",
      "Beckham is certainly showing no signs of kicking back and relaxing just yet, despite turning 50 in May. Speaking to Men’s Health about reaching that milestone earlier this year, the United hero explained: “It doesn’t bother me one bit. People are asking me about it gently, like it should be a big issue.",
      "“It’s not something that I’m worried about—as long as I’m fit and healthy and my family is healthy, that’s all I care about. For my 50th, I’m going to keep it really simple. I want good food, good wine, that’s it. All my closest friends.”",
      "Following a legendary career spanning over 600 matches for club and country, Beckham has ventured into a number of different pursuits. One such venture included founding MLS side Inter Miami in 2018, which began competing in 2020 and has since attracted superstars including Lionel Messi.",
      "The father of four also launched his eponymous Netflix documentary series in 2023, reflecting on his playing days and personal life. In the same popular documentary, he revealed an unexpected hobby by mentioning his newfound love of beekeeping, which he took up during the Covid-19 lockdown.",
      "Beckham expanded on that interest by launching his own honey-based snack company, Bee Up, this year. Aimed at children as a superfood substitute for sweets, boxes of the snacks have recently appeared on shelves across the pond, going on sale at retail giant Target.",
      "He said: \"My love of beekeeping and making my own honey began as a hobby and quickly grew into a passion. I built the hives with my sons, learned how to care for the bees, and mastered the art of harvesting one of nature’s most powerful superfoods.\"",
      "Of course, his long list of off-the-field pursuits are not for want of money. According to the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, Beckham and his wife, former Spice Girl Victoria, have a staggering combined total fortune of £500million.",
      "Business Insider reports that the former Real Madrid Galactico had amassed an impressive $800m (£587m) by the time he retired 12 years ago. At one point, he was the world's highest-paid footballer, and his five-year contract with LA Galaxy in 2008 would be worth around £190m today.",
      "But Beckham has also boosted his personal wealth through a string of lucrative sponsorships and business deals, partnering with big-name brands such as Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and most notably Adidas over the years. He's even launched his own line of fragrances and lent his name to everything from sunglasses to video games.",
      "The Netflix documentary is believed to have netted the ex-footballer a whopping £20m, while he raked in a staggering £72.6m in 2023 thanks to his sponsorships and production company. He also signed a 10-year deal to become an ambassador for Qatar, which reportedly saw him paid around £125m by the country.",
      "As well as making astronomical sums from his various ventures, Beckham is known for his lavish spending, with over a dozen properties making up his remarkable portfolio, which is believed to be worth around £70m. That includes a luxury penthouse in Miami, bought for £17.5m, as well as a London townhouse valued at around £30m.",
      "He also owns a 130-foot superyacht that reportedly cost him around £16m, while his car collection is thought to be worth over £2m in total.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United's struggles have piled the pressure on Amorim's position, with many believing that he'll be sacked if they lose at home to newly-promoted Sunderland on Saturday. The club's all-time top goalscorer, Wayne Rooney, admits that he has 'no faith' in Amorim to turn things around, ex-captain Gary Neville is 'concerned', while fellow icons Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have urged the Portuguese to move away from his three-at-the-back formation.",
      "Amorim is fine with criticism from club legends, but he doesn't agree that his system is the problem. \"It's normal, we cannot run away from the results, and then you have the baggage from last season,\" the Red Devils boss told reporters at his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"Last season doesn't matter to me, in relation to the system we have already spoke about that. We had six games this season and we have lost three. And if we lost against Arsenal because of the system?",
      "\"It's your job to make the opinions. When you saw the game against (Manchester) City, was the first think that you thought when the game started was the system? I don't think you thought about the system in that moment. And Brentford.",
      "\"The way we concede goals, create chances, that is nothing to do with the system, that is my opinion. I'm not saying this team will do better in a different system, that's not my point.",
      "\"My point is if I look at the games we didn't win, the most important thing when I watched the game is not we lost because of the system. That is my opinion, then people have different opinions and that's okay.\"",
      "Amorim was then asked if United's players understand how to play his system, 11 months on from his appointment. \"It was (disjointed against Brentford), but you cannot say one thing doesn't work, when it works one weekend,\" the 40-year-old argued.",
      "\"When things work one day and the other doesn't. It is something about the way we do the same thing. We need to do the same thing, in the same way, every way, and we are not doing it the same every day. Some of you guys have a different opinion, but that's okay.\"",

      "Shay Given believes Ruben Amorim has every reason to be panicking about his Manchester United future during the upcoming international break. United host Sunderland at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon, with the fixture being a must-win game for the increasingly under-pressure Red Devils head coach.",
      "Despite spending considerable money on exciting new players in the summer transfer window, Amorim's men have kicked off the 2025/26 campaign just as woefully as they ended the previous season.",
      "They are currently down in 14th following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford last weekend, which marked their third league loss of the season. With the defeat coming straight off the back of a narrow win against Chelsea, the Portuguese is still yet to secure back-to-back league victories with United, reflecting the rollercoaster and emotionally taxing nature of his almost year-long tenure for everyone involved with the club.",
      "United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos team will have plenty to ponder irrespective of this weekend's Sunderland result, after which there's the international break. Whether they choose to stick with Amorim or cut their losses and start again with a new appointment remains to be seen.",
      "However, former Manchester City goalkeeper Given has delivered a stark warning to Amorim by emphasising how football club owners often make choices to axe managers during international breaks, claiming that's when they become \"twitchy.\"",
      "The pundit told Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction: “In terms of Amorim’s future… look, it’s Sunderland next, and you’d have to say that’s a huge game for him and the team, at home. If he doesn’t win that, then I’d imagine he’ll be under severe pressure.",
      "\"Especially because after that game, it’s Liverpool away, after the international break, and you can’t see much coming from that. And most managers will tell you, if they’re under pressure and there’s an international break coming up, you’re panicking a little bit about your future.",
      "\"A lot of owners get a bit twitchy, especially when there’s a break in the calendar and things aren’t going well… you can’t stress how important that Sunderland game is for Amorim’s future, really.",
      "“If I’m being honest, I really hope he pulls through, because he comes across as a really charismatic guy with a lot of good traits. He’s got personality, he’s got a glint in his eye which I feel like a lot of previous managers haven’t had.",
      "“But he’ll know this is a results business; it’s about getting points on the board and climbing up the table. He’s had a full pre-season with the team now and he’s been able to bring in a lot of players this summer, but we haven’t seen an improvement in results…”",
      "Amorim's future has sparked plenty of discussion in recent weeks. The sight of the despondent manager slumped on the touchline with his head buried in his hands has become the defining picture of his reign.",
      "Various reports have suggested the likes of Xavi, Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola and Oliver Glasner have been lined up as replacements, which, if true, would signal the end of his Old Trafford nightmare.",
      "But, for now, Amorim remains unfazed about his future at Old Trafford. He put on a brave face after the Brentford defeat and said: \"I am never concerned about my job. I am not that kind of guy. It is not my decision. I will do the best I can every minute I am here.\"",

The Red Devils head coach is feeling the heat following a 3-1 loss to Brentford last weekend.",
      "Despite assurances from United's hierarchy that Amorim retains the backing of the board, speculation about his job security is intensifying. Amorim's record in the Premier League has been underwhelming, amassing just 34 points from a possible 99 since taking charge.",
      "The recent Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town prompted United's hierarchy to publicly support him. Newcastle United icon Shearer hasn't minced words regarding Amorim's stint at United, with the team languishing in 14th place in the league.",
      "\"I think if Man United lose to Sunderland he could possibly be sacked,\" Shearer said to Betfair. \"I hate talking about managers and the potential of losing jobs, but Ruben Amorim isn't helping himself, is he?\"",
      "He added: \"Things are getting worse under Amorim, which is remarkable. They certainly haven't improved, that's for sure. They're 14th in the Premier League and that was unacceptable last season.",
      "\"There were excuses for last season which maybe you could put up, but this season there's no excuse for what they've spent. I do find it remarkable that they're getting worse and nothing's changing.",
      "\"Amorim is refusing to budge from his system which, clearly, his players aren't comfortable playing. He doesn't help himself sometimes. We did a graphic on Match of the Day last weekend where he was constantly changing the back five, put Mason Mount on as a no.10 and then four minutes later changed him to a left wing-back. It looks very confusing sometimes, it really does.",
      "\"It is what it is. I don't suspect you'll get many tears from other fans. They're probably enjoying it. Amorim is under a lot of pressure, and the noise will get a lot louder if they don't beat Sunderland this weekend.\"",
      "Shearer also speculated on Zidane's next move amid reports linking the Real Madrid legend with the Old Trafford hotseat: \"I don't know what goes on behind closed doors, but I guess Zidane is sitting, waiting for a huge job where he's got the potential to go and win things.",
      "\"I don't think that potential is at Man United for a few years yet, so I'd be really surprised if Zidane was to go to Man United.\"",
      "He added: \"At the end of the day, they're Man United. One of the biggest clubs in the world and you'll always get someone who thinks they can come in and turn things around.",
      "\"But it's just been mistake after mistake after mistake and there's a part of me that believes Amorim is still in the job because of the errors that have been made by people who've come in above him. Every single corner, they've made a mistake.",
      "\"Whether it was bringing Dan Ashworth in, sacking him and putting him on gardening leave, putting ticket prices up, getting rid of staff, players they've signed. Everything seems to have been the wrong decision so I do believe the results have been nowhere near good enough and they can't wait much longer to turn them around.\"",

      "Amorim squandered a huge chance to win back-to-back league games for the first time in his tenure against Brentford, which led to more speculation over his future at the club.",
      "United have struggled for consistency throughout Amorim's reign. Club sources were forced to clarify their position on Amorim after Brentford, and the 40-year-old needs a win before the international break.",
      "Sunderland have made an excellent start to the season and sit fifth in the table.",
      "Recap what Amorim said during the press conference below.",
      "United will pay tribute to the victims of the horrific terror attack on a synagogue in which two people lost their lives.",
      "It has been confirmed that a minute's silence will be held at Old Trafford ahead of the game against Sunderland on Saturday and black armbands will be worn.",
      "The attack saw a car driven at members of the public, before the attacker emerged and began stabbing those congregated outside. The attack took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.",
      "Two innocent members of Manchester's Jewish community - Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz - tragically died in the attack. Four others were injured, with three still in hospital with serious injuries.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "That's a wrap from today's press conference.",
      "\"It was [disjointed against Brentford], but you cannot say one thing doesn’t work, when it works one weekend. When things work one day and the other doesn’t. It is something about the way we do the same thing. We need to do the same thing, in the same way, every way, and we are not doing it the same every day. Some of you guys have a different opinion, but that's ok.\"",
      "It is not the time to say, it is time to show. I can look at the games this season, for me they are completely different, there are some things the same, some different. There are other things we cannot change. In the other games we are not the same team in some details. I have nothing to say in this moment. My job is to prepare the team.\"",
      "\"It’s normal, we cannot run away from the results. And then you have the baggage from last season. Last season doesn't matter to me, in relation to the system we have already spoke about that. We had six games this season and we have lost three. And if we lost against Arsenal because of the system? It’s your job to make the opinions. When you saw the game against City, was the first think that you thought when the game started was the system? I don't think you thought about the system in that moment. And Brentford. The way we concede goals, create chances, that is nothing to do with the system, that is my opinion. I'm not saying this team will do better in a different system, that's not my point. My point is if I look at the games we didn't win, the most important thing when I watched the game is not we lost because of the system. That is my opinion, then people have different opinions and that's ok.\"",
      "\"We already talk about that, if you see during the six games during this season we are not always the same team in small things. More in the way we play. All the effort that we put, the maximum effort into every single thing. I think it's not the same in different matches. We have to find that balance - it will change everything for us.\"",
      "\"It’s not just the table and the results, which are in the end what matter most, but it’s the way they play. They have a clear identity, they have a very good manager and they are a good team.\"",
      "\"It’s going to be a really tough match, they are doing really well. When you see their games, they draw with one less player in the final of the game. They draw a point and then win in the final play against Brentford. I think the details are changing a lot the table, so we need to pay attention to that. So it’s a team that plays really well, with a clear system, 4-3-3 with a lot of rotations on the side of the pitch. They will be confident and know we are under pressure. We need to be prepared for that. It will be a tough match.\"",
      "\"Crazy world that we are living in at the moment. A lot of these things are happening. Of course, our sympathy for the victims. And we will pay tribute tomorrow. It’s a crazy world in this moment.\"",
      "We'll bring you updates from Amorim in just a few minutes.",
      "Amorim will speak at 1.15pm, but the quotes are embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "We'll bring you updates from his press conference at half past.",
      "We're in position at Carrington and waiting for Amorim to arrive.",
      "What could Amorim be asked about this afternoon?",
      "United defender Tyrell Malacia has been reintegrated into the first-team group.",
      "Malacia expressed his desire to leave United in the summer and was widely categorised in the 'bomb squad' by the media, alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Interest in Malacia was thin on the ground, and a proposed move to Elche collapsed on transfer deadline day. Malacia was included in United's registered squad with the Premier League, and Ruben Amorim said: \"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see.\"",
      "After training with the academy, Malacia has now been welcomed back to the first-team group, raising the possibility of him being named in a Premier League matchday squad again.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Amorim will no doubt be asked about his future at the club today.",
      "A whole host of managers have been linked with the United job if the club do part ways with Amorim, with Eddie Howe one of the names to have been mentioned.",
      "The Newcastle boss has spoken about the rumours he could move to Old Trafford.",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored twice for Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday night.",
      "Hojlund showcased his pace to get in behind Sporting Lisbon's backline for the first goal, and finished brilliantly with a header to win the game for Napoli after a Sporting equaliser.",
      "Speaking after the game, Kevin De Bruyne compared Hojlund to Erling Haaland, which begs the question: why do players improve significantly when they leave Manchester United?",
      "Scott McTominay has been a revelation at Napoli. McTominay opened up on life in Naples during an interview this year, and he's clearly a fan of the food on offer. \"Oh my goodness, the tomatoes. Bellissimo,\" he said. \"I never ate them at home, they are just red water. Here, they actually taste like tomatoes. It is all so fresh. It’s incredible.\"",
      "Could Hojlund's improvement be down to a diet of freshly picked tomatoes from the hills of southern Italy? Is there a curse at Old Trafford that makes it impossible to perform?",
      "Read the full article here.",
      "We'll be bringing you updates from Amorim from 1.30pm today.",
      "The United boss really needs a win this weekend, but it won't be easy for United - it never is - as they face a Sunderland side who've risen to the task of Premier League football so far this season.",
      "Sunderland have three wins and two draws from their first six games back in the top flight, and they're currently nine places above United in the table.",
      "Hello and welcome to today's Manchester United live press conference blog.",
      "Amorim will speak to the media today ahead of facing Sunderland on Saturday and he will be asked about the latest team news, United's performances and much more.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Leny Yoro should come back into the starting line-up, as should Amad, who missed the defeat at Brentford on compassionate grounds following a family bereavement.",
      "I would also give Senne Lammens his United debut and drop Altay Bayindir to the bench. Keeping the same personnel has not worked so far for Amorim, so something has to give.",

      "Steven Railston",

      "Fernandes has made a poor start to the campaign and is struggling with the defensive aspects of the deeper midfield role, so perhaps it makes sense to bench him for this game.",
      "It feels wrong to leave Fernandes out, given his quality, but it might not be a crazy idea.",

      "Questions over Ruben Amorim's tactics refuse to go away, and a defeat against Sunderland today will give the United hierarchy a question to answer in terms of the Portuguese coach's future.",
      "Altay Bayindir looks set to start in goal again in the Premier League. He pulled off some decent saves at Brentford last week but should have done much better for Mathias Jensen's goal in added time.",
      "United's backline looked very frail at the Gtech Community Stadium and so it makes no sense for their best defender to be on the bench, so Leny Yoro comes back into the starting XI. He can start alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw.",
      "Amad is available after missing last week's defeat due to a family bereavement, but Amorim rarely goes gung-ho with his team selection and it's difficult to see him doing so in such a huge game. Amad should play when available but Amorim could spring a surprise and name him on the bench with Diogo Dalot starting.",
      "Casemiro will come back into the side after his suspension, with Bruno Fernandes starting alongside him, while Patrick Dorgu starts on the left.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo started together for the first time last week and there were promising signs as Sesko scored his first United goal and Mbeumo and Cunha linked up to win the penalty that Fernandes missed.",
      "Predicted XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw, Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu, Mbeumo, Cunha, Sesko",

      "Manchester United take on Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium last weekend, which forced United sources to clarify Ruben Amorim still retains the backing of the board.",
      "Amorim is under increasing pressure and needs a positive result against Sunderland before the October international break. United have made an awful start to the season and Amorim's future has dominated headlines.",
      "Sunderland have made a superb start to the Premier League campaign following promotion from the Championship and will sense an opportunity to cause an upset at Old Trafford.",
      "Here are five things to look for:",
      "The Mainoo debate",
      "There has been widespread discussion about Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo this season. Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game and many fans believe the youngster has been underused.",
      "Mainoo came on from the bench against Brentford last weekend. He caught the eye immediately after replacing Manuel Ugarte, and it's surely time to start him against Sunderland.",
      "The midfield has continued to be a problem and Mainoo has the quality to provide control in the centre of the pitch. The youngster has knuckled down in an attempt to regain a starting role, even changing his private chef, and eyebrows will be raised if Amorim snubs him again.",
      "Amorim is not helping himself with selection decisions and his handling of Mainoo has been questionable.",
      "Sunderland love Amad",
      "Amad blossomed during his season-long loan with Sunderland in 2022/2023. The winger delivered consistently strong performances in the Championship and thoroughly enjoyed his time at the Stadium of Light.",
      "Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris was asked about Amad and said: \"His spell here was really important. The coaching staff likes him - as a person and as a player - so both. Now he will be an opponent. So it will be great to say hello but during the game he won't be a friend.\"",
      "Amad was unavailable against Brentford due to a family bereavement, but he is set to return to the squad this weekend. Amad has made a quiet start to the campaign and perhaps an appearance against Sunderland will spark him into life, as he has yet to find the back of the net this term.",
      "United's record against Sunderland",
      "United have lost just two of their last 30 league games against Sunderland, winning 22 of those matches and drawing six, which is a good omen for Saturday afternoon.",
      "Sunderland last won at Old Trafford in May 2014 when Ryan Giggs was in charge as interim manager. Sebastian Larsson's first-half goal secured Sunderland's first win at Old Trafford since 1968.",
      "The Black Cats are fifth in the table after making an impressive start to the campaign, so they will be hopeful of causing an upset, but United are unbeaten in their last 24 league games against newly promoted sides.",
      "Amorim's body langauge",
      "If you're attending the game at Old Trafford this afternoon, it's worth watching Amorim on the touchline because he has looked like a manager under pressure in the last few weeks.",
      "It can often be fascinating to watch Amorim's behaviour on the touchline. He is rarely happy with what he sees on the pitch and almost looks desperate to get involved.",
      "Sunderland is a must-win for Amorim after suffering another setback against Brentford. International breaks are synonymous with managerial changes, and Amorim might need to win to survive.",
      "United have insisted Amorim retains the backing of the board - but that might change if United lose today.",
      "Malacia back in the squad?",
      "Tyrell Malacia has been reintegrated into the first team after a spell of training with the Under-21s. Malacia wanted to leave United in the summer, but a proposed move to Elche collapsed on deadline day.",
      "Club sources have stressed it was always the plan to reintegrate Malacia once he failed to find a new club.",
      "Malacia's reintroduction raises the possibility of him making a return to a matchday squad, although it seems unlikely he will be named on the bench against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim shipped Malacia out on loan to PSV in the January transfer window after deciding he was not good enough. It was the right decision to welcome Malacia back to first-team training, but that doesn't necessarily mean he will play a part in Amorim's plans in the next few months.",

      "Manchester United face a tricky test to reignite their season as they take on Sunderland on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Reeling after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford last week, Amorim will be hoping his players have what it takes to return to winning ways. But they will face a stern test against the side managed by Regis Le Bris side, who are on a four-match unbeaten run.",
      "The newly-promoted side have won three matches, drawn two and lost just once so far this season, conceding a mere four goals, with only Arsenal and Crystal Palace boasting a superior defensive record.",
      "Despite the match promising to be an exciting one, fans in the UK will have to miss out on catching it live as it'll not be televised. The MEN brings you all you need to know ahead of the clash, including timings and how to tune into the action if you're abroad.",
      "Manchester United will host Sunderland on Saturday, October 4, with the match against the Black Cats scheduled to kick off at 3pm.",
      "It'll be the first time the two sides face each other since April 2017 when United claimed a 3-0 win over their opponents at the Stadium of Light. That season spelled the end of Sunderland's 10-year run in the Premier League as they finished 20th and were relegated.",
      "While UK-based fans are forced to miss out on 3pm kick-offs, the blackout rule does not apply to fans across the globe. For example, Peacock will stream the game live in the United States.",
      "Should there be an appetite for extended highlights, Match of the Day airs from 10:30pm on BBC One on Saturday night. The show can also be watched on iPlayer from 8pm on Saturday.",
      "Amorim will be buoyed by the returns of Casemiro and Amad Diallo, both of whom missed last week's 3-1 defeat to Brentford. The Brazilian was suspended for the clash after picking up a red card against Chelsea, while the Ivorian missed the match due to family reasons.",
      "Diallo returned to training on Wednesday and is now in contention to play against his former side, who he scored 14 goals in 42 appearances for in the 2022/23 season. Lisandro Martinez remains United's lone long-term absentee as the defender continues to recover from is cruciate ligament injury.",
      "However, Noussair Mazraoui will be unavailable for selection until after the international break after he picked up a thigh injury. Tyrell Malacia, who was a member of United's infamously named 'bomb squad' this summer, has been reintegrated into first-team activities by Amorim.",
      "For Sunderland, Reinildo remains out of action as he continues to serve a three-match ban after picking up a straight red card against Aston Villa last month.",

      "Transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano has reported that the details are sealed and signed to finalise the deal for Orozco with the fee set at $1million (£741,000). The journalist has claimed that the United lawyers have approved the paperwork and the midfielder will move to England next summer.",
      "Orozco is set to arrive at Old Trafford with a similar profile to Sekou Kone. He signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1m in 2024, having impressed scouts at the Under-17 World Cup.",
      "It's understood that Orozco's performances at the recent Under-17 South American Championship were strong. United's focus on academy signings has expanded in recent years due to Brexit-related regulations.",
      "The regulations prevent them from signing players from European clubs, meaning other continents are being scouted. In January, a £3.3m deal, rising to £7m in add-ons, was agreed with Cerro Porteno to sign Diego Leon.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has endured another few days to forget following on from last weekend's defeat to Brentford in the Premier League. That was United's fourth defeat of the season already with the upcoming fixture against Sunderland now very important to relieve pressure on his job.",
      "Despite being beaten 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium, MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Amorim retains the backing of United's hierarchy with no replacement being lined-up.",
      "There was at the very least one positive from Saturday with Benjamin Sesko on target. He has joined fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo in scoring his first goal for the club, but Matheus Cunha is still yet to find the back of the net.",
      "That attacking trio replaced the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony in the United squad. Those five players were all deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim but some already look to be proving that decision wrong.",
      "Since re-joining Real Betis, Antony has picked up a goal and assist while Sancho has looked bright in cameos for Aston Villa. However, it is the impact of the remaining three in Champions League action that has spoken volumes all while United are preparing for their next game.",
      "Garnacho was pivotal to Chelsea's winning goal against Benfica on Tuesday with his cross turned into his own net by Richard Rios. The Argentine has since posted an Instagram story captioned: \"Champions League nights.\"",
      "24 hours later, Rashford assisted Ferran Torres' goal for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain with a perfectly-weighted pass. The European champions ultimately won the game, but Rashford was a livewire throughout with another clear message sent to Amorim as that is the 27-year-old's sixth goal contribution since moving",
      "Hojlund also sent an unexpectedly cheeky message after a clinical finish with his weaker right foot and a brave headed goal in Napoli's 2-1 win over Sporting CP with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne the supplier for both.",
      "When celebrating the first goal, the Denmark international pointed to the Champions League badge on his Napoli shirt.",
      "With three United outcasts impressing over the last few evenings, it is certainly a concerning indictment for Amorim especially in the wake of a negative result for United.",

After finishing 15th in 2024/25, United currently sit 14th in the division this term, with just two wins from six matches.",
      "With that said, we round-up some of the latest news surrounding the former Sporting CP boss' future.",
      "Gareth Southgate would reject an approach from United in the event Amorim is sacked. The former England boss was previously among the top contenders to become United boss in March 2024.",
      "While Southgate's determination to focus on England ahead of the European Championships prevented United's desire to enter talks on that occasion, the coach is not out of work.",
      "The Daily Star reports however, that Southgate is in no rush to return to football, and continues to keep his options open. Perhaps crucially, Southgate is close friends with Dan Ashworth, whose long-term plan was to appoint Southgate during his time at United before departing after five months.",
      "\"One or two matches, you get flashes. They [United] played quite well against Arsenal on the opening day, but still lost.",
      "\"I've never seen a manager go about their business the way that Ruben Amorim is at the moment. It's a well-trodden path about his system and the fact that it maybe doesn't suit a lot of the players.",
      "\"But you're not telling me he shouldn't be doing better, even with that system. You look at the players at the back - Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire - Bruno Fernandes going forward, [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got good players.",
      "\"It doesn't look like the right fit and that's putting it mildly. There's a lot of talk that they're not going to sack him until a certain date towards the end of this year to save a pay-off.",
      "\"It's difficult to read the minds of the hierarchy at United as to what they're thinking, but I think they know and everyone will be telling them that it is time for a change.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Few appear certain that Amorim's position is secure, with journalist Fabrizio Romano suggesting while the coach is not going to be sacked imminently, upcoming games could prove crucial.",
      "\"I'm not here saying that Amorim is absolutely safe,\" he said. \"Amorim’s job is not absolutely safe in this moment because they need to perform in a different way because Man United want to see results.",
      "\"But it doesn't mean that Manchester United have met with Southgate or already started the process to appoint Gareth Southgate as new boss.",
      "\"So let's wait. Let's see what happens. But for sure, the next games will be important for Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Amorim may have one more month to convince United chiefs he is worth persisting with. It was previously reported that United may delay any sacking of Amorim until he reaches a year of service due to the substantial compensation package he would receive.",
      "As per the Daily Mail, United would need to pay up a hefty £12m bill if they sack the 40-year-old before he reaches 12 months in the hotseat.",
      "On the other hand, there are fears that Amorim could be the one to instigate the exit. United's co-owners, Ineos, are said to be worried that their boss might choose to resign before being dismissed.",
      "It is claimed that Amorim could do this in an attempt to preserve his managerial reputation, as he becomes increasingly frustrated by the constant criticism following losses.",
      "According to the i Newspaper, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are prepared to stand by their manager but Amorim might soon have to contemplate stepping down to 'preserve his managerial career'.",

He was told it was now or never, and United had their man.",

      "Manchester United will look to return to winning ways in the Premier League when Sunderland visit Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be under pressure to improve results following a tough start to the new campaign, with United having won only two of their six games, including a victory over Chelsea. The morale-boosting victory over Enzo Maresca's team was undone by Brentford, as they fell to a 3-1 defeat.",
      "\"Tough decisions and rumours are always part of this job so you have to accept it, you have to deal with it,\" Hurzeler said this week. \"But I really want to say that I have a lot of respect for Ruben Amorim so I won't talk about his job or any rumours that might come regarding him.",
      "\"I'm really privileged to be a coach for Brighton and Hove Albion, I'm very happy here and we still have a lot of work to do.\"",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the latest headlines as Amorim’s future continues to spark debate.",
      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate would reportedly turn down the opportunity to coach United, if Amorim was to be dismissed. Southgate is believed to not be in rush to return to football, but he is keeping his options open, reportedly within and beyond the sport.",
      "In March 2024, he emerged as a top candidate for the United job when Erik ten Hag's position was under threat, but he declined all approaches. Since leaving his role with England, Southgate has not returned to football, instead focusing on public speaking and motivational work. He has also taken on a role hosting a show for the BBC.",
      "Additionally, talkSPORT reported that Southgate had emerged as one of three names on United's shortlist to potentially replace Amorim. But Fabrizio Romano has since dismissed those claims.",
      "MEN Sport says: While Amorim is thought to still have United’s backing, drawing up a list of potential replacements is not a bad idea if results fail to improve. It allows the club to plan ahead and be prepared.",
      "However, going behind the Portuguese manager's back to contact other candidates could seriously undermine Amorim at a particularly tough time for the United boss.",
      "United are targeting Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba regardless of Amorim's future, according to TEAMtalk. United tried to sign Baleba late in the summer transfer window but were unable to reach a deal due to Brighton's high asking price.",
      "The Seagulls reportedly sought a fee similar to the £115million they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023. While Amorim is believed to be a big admirer, the report claims United are still set to pursue a move for the 21-year-old, regardless of whether the manager remains in charge.",
      "It is also claimed they could make a formal approach for his services next year. Liverpool are reportedly tracking the youngster as well.",
      "MEN Sport says: Regardless of whether Amorim remains in charge of the club next season, United should still pursue Baleba, as he represents a long-term investment for the squad. His talent, versatility, and potential for growth make him a player who could influence the team for years to come - and United need more of that.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "While many would have sent Ruben Amorim packing from Manchester United already and almost all others would see an inevitable defeat to high-flying Sunderland on Saturday as the final straw, amid reports claiming that Sir Jim Ratcliffe will give the Portuguese boss a full season as he fails to come to terms with yet another Old Trafford mistake, Amorim is indeed set to survive the upcoming international break.",
      "But in clarifying the full-season “yardstick” Ratcliffe and Ineos will use to decide his future, journalist Ben Jacobs has confirmed his sacking in the next international break.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, I think, doesn’t have that many games to turn things around,” Jacobs said. “I’m not so sure, despite the fact that I respect other reports, that it’s as clear-cut as he’ll get a full season. Speaking to people in and around the club, he’ll get 38 games split across two seasons and they’ll use that somewhat as a yardstick.”",
      "Having now infamously won just 34 points from his first 33, Amorim has five games to save his job, or five to see out before his escape, depending how he’s looking at things.",
      "",
      "It will have been seen as an absolute banker by Manchester United fans trawling the fixture list at the start of the season. An Old Trafford clash against newly-promoted Sunderland, who have beaten United just twice in the Premier League in 30 meetings, losing 22 of them, since Michael Gray and John Mullin goals earned them all three points in March 1997, give it a tick and move on.",
      "But six games into the season we’re wondering if there is a worse fixture for Amorim and United to be playing. Sunderland are sixth having conceded just four goals in those six games, and while no-one expects them to hold that position, there also won’t be many still considering them as relegation candidates. They’ve got good players, a good manager and crucially – in stark contrast to United – are a team.",
      "And yet, they are still Sunderland. They’ve still only just come up, they’ve still got plenty of players in their first Premier League season, just like their manager. It would therefore still be written up as a disaster of biblical proportions if United were to lose to them.",
      "Can’t have that though – Amorim’s got to make it through another four games. A 1-1 draw. Harry Maguire equaliser in stoppage time.",
      "",
      "The 2-2 draw at Anfield last season ushered in Amorim’s best/only half-decent spell as United boss. It was a timely result on the back of defeats to Tottenham, Bournemouth and Wolves, and preceded five wins in six games, including the 6-4 victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup a week later.",
      "Amorim said afterwards that he was “upset” United didn’t claim all three points, but while we’re all doing our level best to insist Premier League leaders Liverpool are currently in the midst of a mini-crisis and defeat to Chelsea on Saturday would ensure a full-blown one for us all to ruminate over for the international break, it’s hard to imagine the level of catastrophe required for Arne Slot’s side not to beat United at Anfield.",
      "“Who doesn’t cause Konate problems right now?” Jamie Carragher asked after Victor Osimhen ran rings around him in another calamitous showing from one of the top ten slumping Premier League players against Galatasaray. Enter Dr. Sesko.",
      "No goals for United then and there’s nothing like a game against United to break Mohamed Salah out of a funk. Hat-trick for him. 0-4.",
      "",
      "This fixture last season was very nearly the end of Amorim, who had reportedly become so ‘disenchanted’ with life at United after a run of one Premier League win in six culminated in the 3-1 defeat to the Seagulls at Old Trafford that he was ‘prepared to resign’ and had to be talked off the ledge by the United bosses.",
      "Despite there being ‘no formal move to quit’ after the game in January, the Portuguese head coach ‘had to be reassured by senior figures at the club, including CEO Omar Berrada, that he would be backed to turn the team’s fortunes around.’",
      "We don’t know how Amorim could see a summer in which United failed to sign a new No.6 or No.1 as one in which he received sufficient backing, but it feels as though he’s been on the brink of resignation as well as the sack pretty much ever since.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler has already led Brighton to victories over Manchester City and Chelsea this season. 1-2.",
      "",
      "Ange Postecoglou being sacked twice before Ruben Amorim after beating him in the Europa League final is both brilliant and famously unjust in equal measure, if it wasn’t definitely actually slightly more brilliant than unjust.",
      "That currently looks very likely to be the case after he was jeered off by Nottingham Forest fans on Thursday following his fourth defeat as manager in six winless games. He wasn’t “sacked in the morning” but surely will be next week if they fail to turn Newcastle over on Sunday.",
      "Amorim is f***ed either way. Ange got the better of him three times last season – 1-0 wins in the UEL final and the Premier League and a 4-3 in the League Cup quarter-final. United also lost both games to Forest and if Ange has gone then they may still be in the midst of a new manager bounce, which they’re due having experienced more of a splat post Nuno-Espirito Santo.",
      "Please, for the love of all that is great and holy, let it be Erik ten Hag guiding his new team to a 1-0 victory.",
      "",
      "United haven’t beaten Tottenham in their last seven meetings, losing five of them, and if current Brentford boss Keith Andrews can “out-school” Amorim after a full eight games as a professional football manager we can only assume that former Brentford manager Thomas Frank – widely regarded as one of the very finest tacticians around – will teach him a sack-ensuring lesson in north London.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo to score a consolation as the last United goal in the Amorim era from the bench. 4-1.",

      "Andoni Iraola is the man for Manchester United and INEOS must pull off a ruthless repeat of the mid-season Ruben Amorim raid to secure his services…",
      "High-flying AFC Bournemouth kicked off gameweek seven of the 2025/26 Premier League campaign at home against Fulham in testing conditions as 50mph winds hit the south coast.",
      "The same can be said for Fulham, who did not register an attempt until the 20th minute, with the combined first-half xG of 0.22 telling you everything you need to know about the dull opening 45 minutes.",
      "Thankfully, the second half was much better, which is thanks mainly to three great moments produced by Bournemouth.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon had injury-ravaged Fulham on course for a 1-0 win after breaking the deadlock, though Bournemouth responded brilliantly to going behind; Semenyo’s exquisite solo goal and clinical last-minute finish, either side of Justin Kluivert’s latest long-range strike, sealed a 3-1 win that moves the hosts up to 2nd (SECOND) in the Premier League.",
      "Bournemouth’s fourth victory from seven Premier League games adds to their stellar start to the 2025/26 season, with the Cherries not breaking stride despite losing Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi in the summer.",
      "It says a lot about how well-run Bournemouth are that their replacements, particularly Bafode Diakite and Adrien Truffert, have seamlessly settled into the Premier League, thus preventing a post-summer decline, while highly respected head coach Iraola is another trump card up their sleeve.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Chelsea v Liverpool, Tottenham, Postecoglou, Haaland, Kane",
      "Iraola quickly made Bournemouth supporters forget about former boss Gary O’Neil, with the Cherries collecting the seventh-most points in the Premier League since his arrival in October 2023.",
      "So it’s no wonder Bournemouth are desperate to tie Iraola to a new contract before his deal expires this summer, though the prospect of him remaining in charge beyond this season appears to be decreasing by the day.",
      "Iraola finds himself in the middle of the manager sack conversation as he’s being mentioned as a potential replacement for big clubs in the Premier League and Europe, including Manchester United.",
      "Various outlets have claimed that he is on Man Utd’s shortlist of possible replacements for under-fire boss Ruben Amorim, with Glasner and Gareth Southgate among the lesser-suited alternatives.",
      "Given that Iraola is also being loosely linked with Chelsea and Manchester City, United would be pulling off a major coup if they secure his services, though there is recent evidence to suggest that their pulling power remains undiminished despite their on-field woes.",
      "From beating Newcastle United to several summer signings to recently gaining the favour of Glasner, Man Utd’s lure is still overwhelming, so when it came to making a decision, it would be a surprise if Iraola said no to INEOS.",
      "Still, if Man Utd are to appoint Iraola, they really ought to get a move on.",

      "Regardless of how this weekend’s match against Sunderland goes (another harrowing loss wouldn’t be a shock at all), Amorim is done at Man Utd because he won’t oversee a long-term fix amid his unrelenting insistence on playing his 3-4-3 formation, which is not suited to the club or his squad.",
      "The sooner he and Man Utd move on, the better, though talk regarding a caretaker appointment is nonsense, as INEOS cannot be seen to write off a season after fewer than ten games.",
      "So, a repeat of last year’s raid for Amorim is needed; only this time to appoint a proven Premier League head coach, with the potential to become elite, who adopts a front-foot playing style and formation that naturally lends itself to the United way.",
      "In hindsight, INEOS’ appointment of Amorim was a huge mistake, but the ruthless manner in which they went about this raid should be commended as a deal was struck under the noses of Man City, who appeared to be laying the groundwork for Amorim to replace Pep Guardiola.",
      "The same mid-season method is required for standout candidate Iraola, mainly due to his potential, suitability and the underlying risk of disappointment in the summer amid heavy competition from across Europe.",

      "Hear us out. Ruben Amorim to Nottingham Forest and Ange Postecoglou to Manchester United in a manager swap deal actually makes sense…",
      "Over the past year, our Premier League sack race leaderboard has been dominated by Amorim and Postecoglou, who are currently first and second (or 20th and 19th?) in the standings.",
      "In Postecoglou‘s case, this is mightily impressive as he has changed clubs and arguably remains under as much scrutiny as Amorim, who is still on the brink at Man Utd.",
      "Postecoglou could and perhaps should have hammered the final nail in Amorim’s coffin at Man Utd when his Spurs side did a job on the Red Devils to win last season’s Europa League. However, it was Big Ange, whose position at Tottenham remained untenable amid their dire Premier League form, who was sacked following the match.",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, was backed with Man Utd’s £230m summer spend on signings intended to make his squad more capable of thriving in his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "There was pre-season optimism at Man Utd, as there often is, but this has swiftly evaporated following a string of poor results, with even Amorim’s strongest supporters losing faith following last weekend’s damaging 3-1 loss to Brentford.",
      "READ: A full 20 reasons why Manchester United should sack Ruben Amorim",
      "In the summer, Man Utd overhauled their attack and signed a new goalkeeper, but they remain equally ineffective across the pitch, with Amorim’s go-to system not suited to this group of players or the club overall, and this won’t change.",
      "Despite this, Amorim had gone for the method of dying on his sword and has refused to change, saying before Saturday’s match against Sunderland: “I don’t think we’ve lost because of the system. That’s my opinion.”",
      "You somewhat have to admire Amorim’s bullish refusal to adapt in an attempt to save face (and boost his chances of falling on his feet elsewhere a la Vincent Kompnay), but this decision will be his undoing at Man Utd.",
      "And while Amorim’s disastrous reign has continued to descend, Postecoglou has returned to management by replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at Nottingham Forest.",
      "For Postecoglou, the attraction to Forest was clear as they are, undeservingly, in the Europa League and are striving for more under an ambitious (and batsh*t) owner.",
      "However, the decision from Forest to appoint Postecoglou was nonsensical, given that he and Nuno have polar opposite playing styles and that they are attempting to usher in this seismic change a few games into the new season rather than in the summer.",
      "Nuno also retains the support of Forest’s supporters, so Postecoglou to Forest was destined for disaster from the get-go, and it’s already falling apart, with home fans calling for his demise during the 3-2 loss against FC Midtjylland on Thursday.",
      "So Forest, like Man Utd, should soon be looking for a new manager and their search could begin as early as this month’s international break if this weekend goes awry.",
      "Then, a swap deal involving Amorim and Postecoglou obviously won’t be considered, but this would be a less daft route than Man Utd and Nottm Forest appointing their current managers in the first place.",
      "Put simply, this is because Forest, unlike Man Utd, actually has players ready-made for Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, while Postecoglou would immediately get brownie points at Old Trafford for using players in their natural positions in a 4-3-2-1 formation, which is perfect for this current Red Devils squad.",
      "I’m not saying that Amorim would excel at Nottm Forest and vice versa with Postecoglou at Man Utd, but the two managers and clubs would be better if they sanctioned this never-before-seen swap deal than they are at the moment.",

      "“Who doesn’t cause Konate problems right now?” Jamie Carragher asked having watched another one of the centre-back’s Liverpool performances directed by Mel Brooks, featuring the Laurel and Hardy theme. It was Victor Osimhen on Tuesday, Jean-Philippe Mateta last weekend and Joao Pedro will be champing at the bit on Saturday, assuming Slot doesn’t remove the opportunity for further farce by taking him out of the firing line.",
      "There are indeed rumours of a move to Real Madrid, and no progress on a new contract suggests he will move on a free transfer at the end of the season. But the way his head has been turned and seemingly removed entirely from his neck stands in stark contrast to Marc Guehi’s reaction to what was a transfer that actually very nearly happened.",
      "“The sun goes up, the sun comes down, life goes on,” the wonderfully sanguine Guehi said. What Slot wouldn’t give to have him over Konate right now.",
      "",
      "Very difficult for any Manchester United player who was around last season to experience a slump in form that doesn’t leave them as a boneless mess of offal on the Old Trafford turf, though human entrails may have been a more useful plug for the midfield hole than Manuel Ugarte has proved to be this term.",
      "Fortunately they spent £200m on a whole new forward line, and we could just as easily have plumped for either Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo here, who have scored a goal and claimed no assists in the Premier League in 846 minutes combined, but we must all at least concede that they are an improvement on whomever was operating in those inverted positions last season.",
      "That’s not the case with Sesko, though. He’s got one goal, and needed three bites at that before he scored against Brentford, and is doing excellent work to realise the Manchester United fear that they have replaced one inexperienced striker who crumbled under the pressure with another.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund starring for Napoli having escaped Old Trafford is one of a full 20 reasons United should sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "“He is not injured but in the tendon he has a difficulty,” Guardiola said when asked about Rodri’s absence against Burnley, before claiming he was taken off after an hour against Monaco for tactical reasons. ACL injuries are famously difficult to return from and easing him back into action is the way to go.",
      "But Nico Gonzalez replacing him on Wednesday before allowing Eric Dier a good sniff of his shin pad to concede a penalty in the dying moments, while simply a poor decision, will only add to the feeling that the £50m(?!) signing from Porto is not the Spain international’s long-term successor.",
      "Rodri should be in his prime at 29, but City’s metronome has lacked rhythm this season, and the apparent search for another No.6, just eight months after Gonzalez was recruited, which has seen Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson linked with a move to the Etihad, in itself raises huge questions as to whether Guardiola and the City bosses ever expect Rodri to return to his Ballon d’Or best.",

      "While we’re reticent to judge books by covers and refuse to sign up to the view that All Footballers Are Idiots, we can’t help but feel – entirely unfairly – after a start to his Liverpool career in which Kerkez doesn’t really look like he knows what he’s doing, that the 21-year-old may not be the fastest of learners.",
      "He’s the only Liverpool player to appear in all nine of their games this season, starting seven of them, and having got two goals and six assists in the Premier League for Bournemouth last season, he’s not got a sausage for the Reds, while ducking out of headers and providing nothing like the left-side solidity in defence next to Virgil van Dijk that Liverpool reaped the rewards in eight seasons of Andy Robertson.",
      "",
      "We loved watching Rogers last season, the goals and assists, but mainly because he’s not your typical No.10. He’s not renowned for delicate touches, a small turning circle or for having his head on a swivel in those tight spaces between midfield and defence.",
      "Of course, he can get on the half-turn and play defence-splitting passes, often as well as his namby-pamby counterparts in that position. But he also bullies his way through challenges, with his most memorable moments those in which he picks the ball up with no space in front of him and thinks ‘f*** it I’m just gonna run at the goal anyway’.",
      "But he always looked like a player – and he reminds of us Dele Alli in this way – that would really suffer when things aren’t quite right. The first touch is now worse than imperfect and therefore often unrecoverable, and while we’re not sure how Martin Keown expects Ezri Konsa to “lead” Rogers to improve his retention of possession, we don’t blame him for seeking answers to Rogers’ dramatic drop-off this season.",

But in our eyes – and we suspect in Nuno Espirito Santo’s – 2024/2025 was the season of Milenkovic.",
      "And we can’t imagine a defender who quite clearly bloody loves defending has ever had a more enjoyable time than while playing under a manager who values that art at least as much as he does. We therefore wonder whether he’s had a less enjoyable time than he’s enduring right now under a manager who sees defending as the scourge of football and now faces the sack just three weeks into his reign with no wins and four defeats in six games.",

      "",
      "It wasn’t all that long ago that Pep Guardiola had such centre-back riches that he had to play a couple of them at full-back, maybe one in midfield and leave at least one very fine one on the bench. It was sort of a toss-up then as to who would play in those central positions, but at that point because they were all excellent. Now it feels more as though they’re much of a mediocre muchness.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely.

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",

      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",

      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",

      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening six games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon. And now it’s standing room only.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord for three wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",

      "He is currently trying – and failing – to deploy it with a Forest squad far less suited than Tottenham,, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability. Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",
      "Postecoglou is the first Forest manager in a hundred years – an actual century – to go winless in his first six matches in charge. It helps not that he replaced a popular figure but the shadow of Nuno would be no inconvenience if Forest weren’t shipping goals for fun while showcasing all the flaws associated with Ange ball. Thirteen goals conceded, six from set-pieces, is it? Stunning.",

      "Jude Bellingham has been both AXED and DROPPED by England after Thomas Tuchel REFUSED an obvious request. Gareth Southgate has some shock Man Utd demands.",
      "As one of precious few individuals to manage the seemingly impossible feat of winning back-to-back games as a Premier League coach, Gareth Southgate is inevitably front and centre of any conversation surrounding Manchester United and Ruben Amorim.",
      "He really could be the next Manchester United manager. Probably not. But he could. And that is enough.",
      "The claim, however, is that he is hardly jumping at the chance. Southgate has his reservations, perhaps because it would be difficult to persuade Sir Jim Ratcliffe to spend £50m on Kieran Trippier.",
      "But someone in the Southgate camp has clearly been speaking to certain voices in the media, because…",
      "‘Southgate ‘lays out two demands’ to even consider Man Utd talks as pressure builds on Red Devils boss Amorim’ – Daily Mirror website.",
      "‘Gareth Southgate ‘insists on two Man Utd promises’ to replace Ruben Amorim if he’s sacked’ – Daily Star website.",
      "So what precisely is Southgate asking for? Only green M&Ms in his office? His initials emblazoned on a waistcoat? The suspense is killing us.",
      "‘Gareth Southgate would demand time and patience from Manchester United if he was to succeed Ruben Amorim.’",
      "Oh for fu…",
      "Come back to us when Gareth Southgate demands impatience and to be judged after a couple of games. Then you’ve got an actual story.",
      "",
      "‘More relevantly, the status quo from the United hierarchy has not changed. Amorim retains the backing of the United board and will do so until he is sacked.’",
      "Next week: Bruno Fernandes will remain captain until he is not.",
      "",
      "England squad announcement day offers brief respite from what has become an intensely competitive Premier League manager sack race.",
      "And it is absolutely, undeniably noteworthy that Jude Bellingham is not part of Thomas Tuchel’s selection.",
      "But a) he has not been ‘DROPPED’, and b) it is only really ‘a major shock’ if you have been paying no attention or are a tabloid journalist. In which case, Mediawatch offers its sincere condolences.",
      "John Cross writes that Bellingham ‘has been sensationally left out’ of the squad and Thomas Tuchel ‘has effectively admitted’ he was ‘DROPPED’.",
      "Well he wasn’t part of the last England squad due to injury, only made his return for Real Madrid after more than two months out following surgery on September 20, and has played precisely 100 minutes of football in his four appearances since.",
      "As Tuchel pointed out in a press conference, while Bellingham “wanted to be called up” he ultimately “lacked rhythm”.",
      "But does it really need to be explained why a player who has started one game for club and country in the last 86 days not being picked to potentially face Wales in a friendly or Latvia in a World Cup qualifier isn’t a particularly ‘massive surprise’?",
      "The ‘effective admittance’ from Tuchel was his quote asking the proverbial question: “Why not bring the same group in because they set the standards?” And, of course, not mentioning Bellingham or indeed any player specifically by name in his helpful clarification as to why Bellingham has been ‘DROPPED’.",
      "‘It also comes just two days after Bellingham was named as the England fans’ Player of the Year so this must be seen as a major shock,’ Cross adds, as if an award for performances last season bears any relevance whatsoever to a decision made based entirely on circumstances in October 2025.",
      "Bellingham not being picked is notable and interesting. But it is also completely explicable and understandable if given more than a moment’s thought.",
      "",
      "Bellingham had been both ‘AXED’ and ‘DROPPED’ according to the MailOnline, who say ‘Tuchel’s cryptic comments hint it’s INTENTIONAL’, as if he might have accidentally left him off the list initially.",
      "Tuchel also ‘REFUSED Jude Bellingham’s request,’ which is one way of interpreting a elite-level professional footballer predictably wanting to play football all the time and a manager making decisions based on more things than that one-eyed desire.",
      "The Mail are no doubt thrilled by Bellingham’s omission after laying into him throughout the last international break.",
      "And Craig Hope picks up where he left off with a lengthy opinion piece again calling out Bellingham’s ‘leading man syndrome’, ‘intimidatory manner’ and ‘ego’.",
      "‘Tuchel clearly feels a change of mindset is needed if they are to prosper together,’ he writes. Either that or Bellingham’s four appearances since returning from a quite significant surgery in the summer have totalled one minute, 19 minutes, 70 minutes and ten minutes respectively, and England have more than enough good players to not feel the need to take unnecessary risks over fitness and, as Tuchel said, “rhythm”.",
      "",
      "This line from Hope brings up a point worth reiterating far and wide considering some of the coverage Mediawatch has seen of the England squad announcement:",
      "‘[Tuchel] needs to know if [Bellingham] has listened. He needs to know the reaction after he branded the 22-year-old’s on-field demeanour ‘repulsive’ in June.’",
      "A couple of points.",
      "Tuchel didn’t ‘brand’ Bellingham’s ‘on-field demeanour ‘repulsive”. He said sometimes people on the outside “cannot see the nice and well-educated and well-behaved guy that I see and the smile. If he smiles, he wins everyone but sometimes you see the rage, the hunger and the fire and it comes out in a way that can be a bit repulsive. For example, for my mother when she sits in front of the TV.”",
      "And more importantly, Tuchel also apologised unreservedly for using that word “unintentionally”, adding: “I am experienced enough and should’ve known better, I should’ve done better. I thought I had a little more credit with you guys (the media) that I do all this in my second language.”",
      "Obviously not. We would apologise but it seems like they are completely ignored by the following month.",
      "",
      "And of course Henry Winter reckons Bellingham being left out is ‘baffling’. To be fair, everything must be confusing when you view life through the prism of the first half of Peter Beardsley’s debut season for Liverpool, 1987/88.",
      "When Anfield collectively chanted “you greedy b*stards, enough is enough” with the full support of the travelling Sunderland fans, owners FSG had to change.",
      "Dr Tottenham prescribed Wolves a point last week, but an even more potent Spurs banter move should ensure Leeds get all three this weekend.",
      "Gareth Southgate fears that Man Utd wouldn’t give him the four years he’d need to make the Red Devils contenders again, according to reports.",
      "One Liverpool supporter is particularly riled at the idea Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk have ‘downed tools’. Maybe Arne Slot’s transition will just take time.",
      "After consecutive Premier League defeats put an early end to Chelsea’s slim title hopes, Maresca is now of course on the verge of the sack at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Will Liverpool’s ‘mini-crisis’ become an actual crisis at Chelsea? One thing’s for sure: there’s absolutely nothing mini about the latest Big Weekend."

      "But two defeats in four days to Crystal Palace in the Premier League and Galatasaray in the Champions League have turned the mood slightly with previous poor displays now becoming an issue for some.",
      "Their midfield and defence have come under scrutiny with the performances of Konate one concern amongst a lot of supporters and pundits.",
      "Liverpool are one injury away from disaster with Giovanni Leoni potentially out for the full season and the Reds failing to get a deal for Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi over the line on deadline day.",
      "With Guehi’s contract up at the end of the season, Liverpool could face increased competition for his signature in the January transfer window and Everton’s Branthwaite – who has been the subject of bids from Man Utd in the past – is now an option.",
      "READ: Liverpool rue Salah contract as ‘ageing’ Van Dijk fails to handle ‘complete sh*t’",
      "Former Man Utd and Tottenham scout Mick Brown told Football Insider: “Branthwaite will certainly be on the radar at Liverpool.",

      "“Clubs like Liverpool will be keeping an eye on that I’m sure, seeing how well he recovers and if he gets back to his best quickly because it’s another long layoff for him.",
      "“Plus, he’s a left-sided centre-back, and that’s the position Van Dijk plays in at the moment so bringing him in would do little to solve their problems.",
      "“But like I say, that interest will be there as a long-term option, and maybe he could come in and develop his game a bit more by learning from Van Dijk.",
      "“I just don’t see him as a replacement for Konate, and it would be a shock to see him leave Everton now.",

      "Spanish website Defensa Central insists that ‘the media and agent world is practically 99% sure that Konaté will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons’.",

      "Nicol said on ESPN: “It would be really harsh to pull one person out, but I think the man that was at the start of it was Konate. He had an absolutely, unbelievably horrendous first half.",
      "“He couldn’t pass the ball properly, he kept giving fouls away, he got booked, he’s trying to fight Mateta. I know Konate’s a big lad but Mateta’s bigger than him and you’ve got to use your brains.",

      "“Only some poor finishing, particularly from Mateta, is the reason that Liverpool were still in this game at all.. The truth of the matter is that all of the things Liverpool didn’t do well today are the same things they haven’t done well all season… Liverpool’s backline just doesn’t look composed at all.",
      "“Yes, you would hope the midfield can stop the opposition getting at the backline as often as it does. But at the end of the day the backline is there to do the job and right now it doesn’t look comfortable anytime it is asked to defend – whether it is today or the previous games.",

      "It has been claimed that Liverpool would be “prepared to let” one key player “leave” the Premier League giants at some point in 2026.",
      "Liverpool could reportedly be on the brink of losing two players as Real Madrid have ‘secured two signings’ as Xabi Alonso has given his ‘approval’.",

      "Regular readers of these hallowed pages will know that our push for Premier League managerial sackings is generally limited to five, maybe six, reasons why they should be shown the door.",
      "But This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And still – at time of writing – Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. So we’ve come up with 20.",
      "",
      "We would be completely bored of it by now if we didn’t actually quite look forward to witnessing the level of exasperation shown by Amorim when asked by a reporter in each and every press conference or post-defeat interview whether he might consider changing his formation.",
      "He maintains, almost entirely on the basis of success at one other football club, that it’s not the system that’s the problem, and he’s not for moving.",
      "We don’t quite know why we’ve reached a point in professional football where a manager who can’t, or at least won’t, adapt is held up as some sort of misunderstood genius, but Amorim has been given a helluva lot of rope because of his stubbornness.",
      "The ‘it worked at Sporting’ argument very simply falls down on the basis of Manchester United not being Sporting, and we do wonder whether Amorim now regrets his early insistence that he would stick with 3-4-3 no matter what.",
      "While he understandably sees a move away from his principles as a respect-dwindling admission of defeat, surely the very real, actual defeats are far more damaging to his reputation.",
      "",
      "We’re as culpable as anyone for lumping formation and philosophy together. They go hand in hand – we get it. But it’s also possible for a system to not be working for a team while the wider ethos is apparent. That’s not the case here.",
      "Without saying ‘pressing’ or ‘transition’ because literally every f***er with a few magnets on a tactics board would pick those two facets of the game as key to their philosophy, can anyone tell us what Amorim’s core Manchester United principles are? You said ‘overloads’, didn’t you? Get out.",
      "",
      "Only 11 Premier League managers have had a worse record after 33 games. Frank Lampard had the same tally at Everton.",
      "",
      "Like a p*ssed up bloke down the pub going nose to nose with you looking for any excuse for a rumble, he’s f***ing asking for it.",
      "After being talked down from a ledge after a 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, reports continue to suggest Amorim may walk before he’s pushed. And while that sounds very much like a £12m compensation saving, we can see Gary Neville now with his headset on explaining why someone quitting Manchester United before they quit on him is “the lowest of the low for the football club”.",
      "",
      "Erik ten Hag kept his job because Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Sure, it was maybe the only time in the entirely of his second season at Old Trafford when performance and result came together, and it was absolute madness to hand him a new contract on the back of it, but it was a trophy, and one they claimed by beating very much the best team in England at the time in Manchester City.",
      "Amorim didn’t win a trophy and lost to the 17th best team in England, managed by a guy whose only three victories in his last 15 games in all competitions for Tottenham and now Nottingham Forest came in that final and the two semi-finals against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "",
      "Mainoo’s teammates are ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker is “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too is Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte, and it’s not as though Fernandes himself has been in undroppable form.",
      "Not only are United terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",
      "",
      "It was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and INEOS plumping for him as their manager, and he would probably already be out of the job if it wasn’t for that charm. It makes him a very difficult man to dislike and there’s no doubting his ability to hold the room.",
      "But if anything, he’s honest to a fault, and we can’t imagine Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are too enamoured with him besmirching the great name of Manchester United.",
      "Heralding this as “the worst team in Manchester United history” can’t be good for the share price.",
      "",
      "“How are you supposed to adapt to a situation when you’re changing it constantly?!” a genuinely irritated Micah Richards asked on Match of the Day, accompanied by a graphic showing the scattergun changes Amorim made in an attempt to rescue a point against Brentford, which ended with Mason Mount at left wing-back in one of the more laughable examples of his 3-4-3 obstinacy.",
      "We can just about give him a pass for a bit of substitution chaos to turn a game on its head, but what we can’t fathom is his insistence on changing at least one of his centre-backs in every single game.",
      "He’s made ten unenforced centre-back substitutions this season. Win, lose or draw, it doesn’t matter. Leny Yoro came on for Maguire on Saturday, started on the left side, forcing Matthijs de Ligt into the middle, then moved to the right when Mount came on for Luke Shaw, with Diogo Dalot moving into the back three.",
      "There’s a fair chance they didn’t know where they were supposed to be playing come the end of the game, and there’s no way the players walked off that pitch believing they’re in the hands of a measured tactician.",
      "",
      "Reports suggest sacking Amorim will cost the club £12m. For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position, meaning any new manager would need to make a five-place improvement on whatever Amorim might achieve this season for his sacking to make fiscal sense. Yer da could do that.",
      "",
      "It really is amazing just what a tonic not being at Manchester United is. After finding the net on debut for Napoli, Hojlund scored two goals in the Serie A side’s 2-1 win over Sporting in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "The first saw him burst through two defenders and latch on to a through ball from Kevin De Bruyne before sliding the ball between the goalkeeper’s legs; the second saw him put his head where it hurts to beat the ‘keeper to a De Bruyne cross.",
      "If you wanted a brace to showcase a Proper Striker it was just about perfect and the first goal in particular is the sort of run and finish many Manchester United fans will have been expecting from Hojlund when Amorim arrived at the club. He’s got a not dissimilar profile to Viktor Gyokeres, who banged goals in for fun under Amorim in Portugal.",
      "Instead what they got was a clearly talented striker brought to Manchester United ruined by a manager who – as Benjamin Sesko is now also evidence for – doesn’t know how to get the ball to them.",
      "",
      "In Keith Andrews’ eighth game as a football manager he “out-schooled” Amorim. His tactics weren’t revolutionary – they didn’t need to be.",
      "Brentford recycled passes between their defenders while every now and again playing the ball into midfield to draw United on to them. When the United midfielders stepped out to press, Jordan Henderson or someone else played a long ball up to Igor Thiago, who then had what turned out to be the very simple task of bullying one, two or all three centre-backs to win free-kicks, create chances and score goals with the Red Devils midfield nowhere to be seen.",
      "As Alan Shearer said, Amorim is making life “easy” for Andrews and every other manager he comes up against as they know exactly how United are going to play.",
      "",
      "Glasner is currently the bookies favourite to replace Amorim and would apparently take the job “in a heartbeat”. More fool him.",
      "The Austrian makes a lot of sense, not least because of the wonderful progress he’s made at Palace, first without Michael Olise and now without Eberechi Eze, but also because he’s showing that 3-4-3 can work in the Premier League and his contract expires at the end of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate is second favourite and we can see why he’s Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s pick, but as Jamie Carragher said, “the problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, ‘I could do a better job than that.'”",
      "",
      "Haven’t heard this nonsense in a while, have we? And we wonder whether that’s because the football Amorim has United playing is now so far removed from the fabled Manchester United DNA that the genetics of the football club is no longer even considered as part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Ole back at the wheel, anyone?",
      "",
      "“Something has to change and you cannot change 22 players,” Amorim said after the historic defeat to League Two Grimsby, in another hint at his possible resignation, having claimed “the players spoke really loud” through their performance.",
      "But the players might argue, as we and a raft of other publications and pundits did, that Amorim rocking from side to side on the bench as his team lost the penalty shootout was a pretty deafening declaration of a more overarching defeat. It looked like the point of no return, and still does.",
      "",
      "There’s always a rock under the one at the bottom. And while there’s undoubtedly some recency bias involved, with the latest defeat often declared a new nadir to sell a sack story or just because it’s fun to write and read about last week’s “worst Manchester United team in history” being somehow better than this week’s, there may also be a cumulative effect which automatically makes the most recent defeat the new nadir because of the sustained period of sh*te.",
      "Anyway, there have been plenty. Grimsby, Brentford, a 2-0 home defeat to Graham Potter’s West Ham, Brentford again, Wolves on Boxing Day.",
      "",
      "Amorim is an absolute gift when it comes to presenting us with images of his and Manchester United’s slow death. Aside from smiling pictures in press conferences or while walking into the stadium before the latest crushing blow, there are three stock Amorim photos available for selection: shouty, gesticulating Amorim; crouched down, head-in-hands Amorim; looking down, deep-in-thought Amorim.",
      "We love, love, love that he was asked about that last one after the Brentford defeat, dismissing it as “nothing” and “something I’ve always done”, but we will always choose to side with the body language experts drafted in to give their hot takes.",
      "“You can see him crouched down in a fetal position, almost like what a baby does,” said the Mirror’s crack BLE. “Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that’s the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.”",
      "",
      "You’ve got to wonder if, while watching Rashford score a brilliant brace for Barcelona against Newcastle in the Champions League, Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses considered the possibility that they may have backed the wrong horse.",
      "Rashford would very likely still be a Manchester United player if Amorim wasn’t the manager, and is currently performing at a higher level than any of the forwards currently in the Red Devils squad, as he did at Aston Villa last season.",
      "After all of that contrived nonsense in the media about Barcelona sending him back to Old Trafford after a couple of games, he’s now asserted himself as a starter in one of the best teams in Europe, assisting a goal in each of his last four La Liga games and against PSG in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "“I think he’s still in a job, because I think the powers that be on Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far and decisions that they’ve made on and off the pitch that they almost don’t want to admit right now, that they’ve made another,” Jamie Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "Sounds about right, but we put it to Ratcliffe and the Manchester United powers that be that by not admitting to the mistake of hiring Amorim they’re currently making another in not sacking him.",
      "There have been a helluva lot of mistakes though… Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "",
      "It was reported last month that Amorim was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’ as players ‘questioned his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace’, and we’re not convinced that an Enzo Maresca and Robert Sanchez-inspired victory over Chelsea will have outweighed a Brentford defeat in the dressing room confidence stakes since.",
      "",
      "For Amorim, Ratcliffe, the players, the fans, the cabal of Manchester United pundits, it is really just quite embarrassing just how bad at football they are. And yes, it is also quite embarrassing to spend £200m on new players for a manager only to sack him a couple of months later, but what’s the alternative? Wade through this sh*te until January and spend another wedge of cash on the next raft of ill-advised souls doomed to fail at Old Trafford?",
      "We understand that Amorim isn’t solely to blame – there are at least five other culprits – but there really is currently no-one more to blame for this mess. He has been, and will continue to be, a “disaster”.",
      "After Ratcliffe’s ‘yardstick’ was revealed we now know how many games Ruben Amorim has to save his Man Utd job. It does not look good…",
      "Hear us out. Ruben Amorim to Nottingham Forest and Ange Postecoglou to Manchester United in a manager swap deal actually makes sense…",
      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Man Utd’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps him in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has revealed a “yardstick” that Man Utd are going to judge Ruben Amorim by as he divulges the “most disillusioned” players.",

      "Manchester United are ‘more likely’ to get relegated than qualify for Europe, so there should be zero debate over Ruben Amorim’s future…",
      "United are still failing to break their bleak Groundhog Day cycle, with the fallen Premier League giant back to square one following a dreadful year under Amorim.",
      "The 40-year-old was given a lot of grace in his first few months at Man Utd as he did not receive nearly enough criticism for last season’s dire decline en route to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "There were excuses aplenty and pleas for more time in and out of the club so Amorim could build a squad equipped to thrive in his 3-4-3 formation over a couple of transfer windows, with optimistic (or naive) supporters getting giddy in the summer as the club spent over £200m on new attackers and signed a new goalkeeper.",
      "But folks, it has been Groundhog Day once again as the Red Devils have capitulated at the earliest sign of adversity, with three Premier League losses in six games and the embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town exposing their lack of progress.",
      "READ: The five people most to blame for the Manchester United mess",
      "So far, there has been zero improvement in attacking areas following their £200m overhaul, while United remain just as ineffective in the other positions after overlooking the midfield department and signing another No.2 instead of an upgrade on Andre Onana in the summer.",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd are getting no better, as his blank refusal to adapt to save face means he is dying on his sword, and the favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked needs to be axed soon if the club are to salvage anything from this season, with this squad of players capable of much more provided there are a few tweaks.",
      "Really, Amorim should have already been and gone, but INEOS will surely have no choice but to get rid if they lose against newly-promoted Sunderland at Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "Ahead of this game, ‘football statisticians at 247Bet’ have used a supercomputer to make predictions for the remainder of this season and for Man Utd, it makes for grim reading.",
      "According to the data, Man Utd ‘will finish the season on just 45 points’ to ‘progress to 14th place’, with this a three-point improvement on last campaign’s record low.",
      "The system also gave United ‘15% chance of relegation, a 0% chance of securing Champions League or Europa League football’, while they are ‘almost as likely to go down as 16% Sunderland’.",
      "It also says that the Red Devils should finish eight points clear of the bottom three, with Brentford, Wolves and Burnley backed to get relegated. So, there’s that at least…",
      "AI will eventually get to us all, but we at F365 have taken a hard line that supercomputers are bullsh*t and this one is the same.",
      "Still, it’s unforgivable for Man Utd, who lead our five-year net spend table, to even loosely be considered for relegation and be on a par with newly-promoted Sunderland, regardless of how well they have settled back into the Premier League, and it should leave INEOS with no option but to sack Amorim.",

      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",

      "Friday 3 October 2025 20:52, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and backs Sunderland to beat Manchester United.",
      "If you're looking to jump on a savvy angle this weekend, make sure you're on Tottenham's set-piece threat. Since Thomas Frank took the reins, Spurs have added a whole new weapon to their attacking output: their massive threat from dead balls. And against this Leeds side that wobbles like jelly when defending set-pieces, the numbers point to backing Spurs to cause Leeds lots of problems.",
      "Leeds are shipping 1.7 shots per game from set-pieces and have already allowed four goals conceded via that method, including last weekend's last equaliser for Bournemouth.",
      "Frank's teams make clever blocks, delayed runs, decoy movements, and that causes chaos in the six-yard box. Micky van de Ven has already scored three goals this season as the Dutchman has quietly become a monster at these attacking set-pieces. He is 33/1 with Sky Bet to score first.",
      "Eberechi Eze is not your typical Arsenal midfielder. He doesn't deal in safe passes, low-risk link play or rehearsed rotations. He thrives on chaos. Unpredictability is in his blood and in an Arsenal side that, at times last season, could feel a little too methodical in the final third from open play, Eze's spontaneity and eye for something different is the perfect curveball that opposition players must warn against.",
      "With the technical security around him, he's going to get more touches in dangerous areas, more one-on-one situations and this should lead to an increase in his shots on target numbers than what the algorithms are predicting. He's recorded two shots on target in both of his last two starts at Newcastle and Port Vale which points towards the 6/4 on him clearing that line again with Sky Bet being a slice of value.",
      "Those backing Manchester United at 1/2 with Sky Bet are being lured in by their expected goals for data. It's the best in the Premier League (12.21) - but that is as a misleading statistic as you're likely to find when it comes to analysing expected goals.",
      "The moment you start judging a team's attacking quality solely by their xG, you're dancing on a tactical tightrope without a safety net when it comes to making betting decisions.",
      "United's expected goals data is so healthy as the game-state has forced them to chase games after falling behind in matches, owing to their horrendous defensive process, which is the second worst in the Premier League according to expected goals against (9.35).",
      "From six Premier League games, they have spent 244 minutes trailing this season - that is why those xG figures appear so healthy.",
      "A huge chunk of that attacking data and chance creation has come when the game was out of their reach. If a team only looks dangerous when it's losing, how dangerous is it, really? That's a red flag.",
      "And, despite over a decade of chaos, churn and comedy defending, it's still a club that draws in public money like few others in the betting markets, which in turn keeps their price shorter than it should be.",
      "Sunderland to avoid defeat on the double chance at a whopping 13/8 with Sky Bet it is then.",
      "The markets have chalked up over 2.5 goals as a short-priced favourite at 1/2 with Sky Bet - as they often do in the Premier League - but peel back the layers and there's plenty of evidence to suggest a low-scoring, tight encounter is the smarter play. Under 2.5 goals is around 6/4 with Sky Bet. And that's value.",
      "Arne Slot is a pragmatic, flexible coach who wants control, not the chaotic defending we've seen at times from Liverpool this season.",
      "Slot will be aware of the noise heading into an international break about his side and this is why pure focus will be on defensive solidity, discipline and trying to control the game through possession at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Plus, still without Cole Palmer, Chelsea look predictable and blunt.",
      "I'm expecting a slow burner.",
      "Burnley's new signing, Florentino, is shaping up as a fantastic bet in the fouls committed markets, which are often overlooked as a mainstream betting medium but are laced with value especially for new signings adapting to the Premier League's physical demands.",
      "The Premier League is fast, physical and ruthless and Florentino's style screams dynamic enforcer on what we've seen from him in his two starts so far. He's a midfielder who plays with aggression and intensity, breaking up play and never shying away from a physical duel.",
      "The former Benfica man committed 1.79 fouls per 90 last season, including making at least one foul in his last 19 starts. He's already made three in two starts for Burnley and such is Villa's foul-drawing strength in central areas, that kind of average is likely to be repeated at Villa Park. The Evens for two or more Florentino fouls looks a solid play.",
      "Crystal Palace have the team to do something really special this season in the Premier League.",
      "But they won't.",
      "As to remain consistent in the Premier League will be almost impossible for them to achieve due to their European commitments.",
      "A first taste of European football in their modern era is something fans and Oliver Glasner will take very seriously. And rightly so. Selhurst Park under the lights for a knockout game will be mega. But as romantic as that sounds, it's also going to bring with it a Premier League hangover.",
      "Clubs of Palace's stature and budget often struggle to handle the double life of domestic and European football. Clubs outside the big six who get Europe have an average drop of 6.3 league positions the following season since 2015. We've seen it with Brighton, West Ham and Leicester over the years. It's going to happen to Palace, so the home win at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks a wise investment on Everton following Palace's midweek trip to Poland.",
      "In a Newcastle midfield built to fight, Sandro Tonali glides and creates the magic. While Bruno Guimaraes orchestrates and Joelinton bullies, Tonali is the biggest goal threat. Everything he does is filled with intent. He doesn't just want to circulate possession. He wants to influence.",
      "When Newcastle play at home, Eddie Howe unleashes a more expansive, front-foot midfield. Tonali becomes the spare man in transitions, the third runner in attacks and has become a goal threat. He's scored five times in his last 17 starts at St James' Park and has averaged a healthy 1.62 shots per 90 with hitting two or more shots in seven of his last 11 home starts.",
      "He's not being priced like a consistent goalscoring threat yet. And that's where the edge is at 11/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brighton at odds-on to beat Wolves? It just doesn't sit right. The price doesn't match the flakiness and inconsistencies involved with Fabian Hurzeler's team.",
      "Yes, Brighton are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are.",
      "Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.6 expected goals per game over the last 13 Premier League - that's the worst per 90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games, too.",
      "Wolves are of course no juggernaut, but they're tactically disciplined, aggressive in duels and more than capable of spoiling Brighton's rhythm in midfield.",
      "The market is pricing up Brighton on vibes rather than reality. Back Wolves on the draw no bet at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "There are few greater joys in the betting game than sniffing out value in the foul markets. It's the new frontier. Goalscorer markets are overcooked. Booking points can be a lottery. Outright markets can be settled on fine margins. But fouls? That's where the true edge lives.",
      "The standout match-up for fouls this weekend is Michael Kayode vs Jeremy Doku. Such is Doku's form right now, all I can say to Kayode is: good luck, son.",
      "Kayode is as raw as they come but very aggressive with his defending, meaning he's foul-prone when isolated.",
      "Douk doesn't just beat defenders, he destroys them. He's drawn 13 fouls in his last five starts and is completing nearly five dribbles completed per game. Kayode is 6/4 to make two or more fouls with Sky Bet. That's a lovely angle to attack.",

      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "“This has to end as quickly as possible,” says Jamie Carragher of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United, labelling it a disaster for both parties. United were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday as their struggles continue under the Portuguese coach",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 21:16, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has described Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United as a disaster for both the club and the manager, urging everyone to shake hands and move on, claiming that another coach could take this group of players into Europe.",
      "Carragher on Amorim...",
      "\"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system,\" Carragher explained on Monday Night Football. \"They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.\"",
      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",
      "\"It could not have gone any worse and I feel for him. He is a young manager and he has had a great start to his career, what he did at Sporting Lisbon was really special. But those results for a club of that stature are just beyond belief.",
      "\"You don't want to see anybody lose their job but I think it would just be better for everyone if they just shake hands and move on.\"",
