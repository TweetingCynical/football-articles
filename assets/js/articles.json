      "Fulham are ready to enter the race for Rasmus Hojlund but want assurances that the Manchester United striker has an interest in joining them with the Dane previously expressing a desire to remain where he is.",
      "The west Londoners are weighing up a move for the forward as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject of bids from Atalanta, which could leave them light in the final third. Those at Old Trafford are open to Hojlund's exit and are currently looking for a suitor.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United regarding the striker and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. That was seen as the most favourable option before Fulham expressed their interest, but they want to know about the player's state of mind, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "United want to move on Hojlund, especially after landing Benjamin Sesko for more than £70m. The ex-Atalanta man has been unable to deliver consistently during his two years in Manchester, leading to them dipping into the market once again.",
      "The player though has expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place, even if Sesko's arrival will push him further down the pecking order.",
      "It is unlikely that Fulham will want a player who was forced out of Manchester and moved to them against his will, as a result they have enquired about his willingness to make the move.",
      "Hojlund was adamant that he relished the competition when he was quizzed on his future during United's pre-season tour of the United States. He said: “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim though gave no guarantees that Hojlund would still be a United player come the end of the summer transfer window. The club will be conscious that they would like to add a midfielder and a goalkeeper - with sales helping raise funds and balance the books.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Complacent Premier League bosses have “no plans” to move any of their domestic fixtures abroad - and claim they have no need to export their brand. Spanish football will break new ground this season after Villarreal and Barcelona were given permission to play their LaLiga fixture in Miami on December 20.",
      "But Premier League chief executive Richard Masters insists English football won’t be following suit - even though clubs voted in favour of a 39th game back in 2008 and it was only binned after world governing body FIFA vetoed it.",
      "Masters said: “LaLiga have been very open about their desire to play matches abroad. The Spanish federation have approved it, but as far as the Premier League’s position is concerned, I’m very clear about it.",
      "“We don’t have plans to play matches abroad. It’s not being discussed around our table. The overall objective of playing matches abroad is to grow that league internationally - but we’re now a genuinely global league.",
      "“All of the data points suggest the Premier League is growing internationally without the need to play matches abroad. We have fantastic international broadcasting partnerships, we’ve got global digital services now for fans to interact with the game and, of course, we’re investing in other things like the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "“But I think playing matches domestically is where we’re going to stay.” Masters’ optimism that English football’s domestic calendar will remain confined to these shores may not be shared by Premier League clubs - more than half of whom have foreign owners.",
      "If a two-thirds majority - 14 top-flight clubs - decide they fancy playing abroad, Masters will be powerless to stop it. Eleven of this season’s Prem clubs are owned by American majority shareholders alone, and the States would be the No.1 choice for a game abroad, just as regular NBA basketball and NFL gridiron games are already played in London.",
      "Masters insisted: “There is no desire to discuss this at the moment. If La Liga want to do it, and it’s within the global framework of the game, then it’ll be a very interesting thing to observe. But number one, two and three: The Premier League does not have plans to do it.”",
      "In his pre-season briefing, Masters claimed the “lights on the dashboard are flashing green” to indicate the game’s rude health economically.",
      "The rising cost of attendance for match-going supporters, however, remains a huge bone of contention for diehard fans. Bournemouth fans face a 530-mile round trip through Friday traffic for tonight’s opening game at champions Liverpool.",
      "Adult tickets in the Holte end for Aston Villa ’s home game with Newcastle cost an eye-watering £77, while a full adult Chelsea replica kit will set fans back £148.",
      "But Masters said: “We fully understand the relationship between full stadiums being part of the show that goes around the world that makes English football special.",
      "“We’ve had a long period of flat ticket prices - some are going up, but eight clubs have frozen their prices this year, and we’re committed again to the £30 price cap for away fans. Although we can’t get involved in the pricing of kits, clubs do understand affordability.”",

      "United signed Sesko in a deal worth up to £74million from RB Leipzig to add to Ruben Amorim's squad in a summer that has seen Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also arrive at Old Trafford. Club chiefs were able to persuade Sesko that United was the correct club to join, despite Premier League rivals having a bid accepted first and being able to offer Champions League football.",
      "Arsenal were an early contender for Sesko's signature too, with the Slovenia international among their priorities. Such was the fee required, the Gunners decided to move on to land Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP instead.",
      "But it was United's persistent efforts that ultimately proved successful in getting a move over the line. And a longstanding relationship between the parties paid off.",
      "\"We were in contact with Man United's negotiations director, Matt Hargreaves, who was a ruthless negotiator,\" Basanovic told the 24UR programme on Slovenian station POP! TV.",
      "\"In the last 10-15 days, they followed my every step, and the talks took place in three different countries and six different cities.\"",
      "Sesko had been of interest to United for as long as seven years and the forward's agent had kept the club well aware of his plans. While Sesko opted against moving to Manchester as a teenager, a transfer to the Premier League was always on the agenda.",
      "Basanovic added: 'We visited their academy when he was just 15. Even then, we were planning this move for the future. At the time, we didn't want him to go [when he was] so young.",

      "\"Whenever a deal doesn't go through, there are always several factors. In the end, everything has to align for it to happen.",
      "\"What's important here is that Benjamin's wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.\"",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton could be thrown into disarray by Liverpool's transfer plans. Ruben Amorim's squad are considering midfield targets after bringing in three forwards this summer.",
      "New striker Benjamin Sesko is set to lead a revamped United attack, supported by fellow signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. After assembling their front three, United have shown interest in Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Seagulls' hefty price tag has reportedly led the club to consider Palace ace Wharton as an alternative. However, United's chances of securing a deal for Wharton could hinge on the futures of Palace's other star players, Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "The Independent has stated that United have identified Wharton as an alternative to Baleba due to the latter's price tag, said to exceed £100million. However, it is suggested that the Eagles may demand even more for Wharton if they do part with England duo Guehi and Eze.",
      "Liverpool are keen on Guehi to strengthen Arne Slot's defensive choices. The 25-year-old is in the final year of his contract and Liverpool are hoping to sign the centre-back for £35m, while Palace are believed to be demanding £40m. The centre back is keen on the move but a deal looked to be off with both clubs some distance apart on his valuation.",
      "However, Guehi's situation at Palace has been further muddled by the club's interest in Liverpool's Harvey Elliott, who is valued at the same price. The Sun reports that a swap deal involving Guehi and Elliott hasn't been ruled out, which could damage United's hopes of signing Wharton.",
      "There was previously hope that Guehi might remain at Palace this season, potentially making the Eagles more receptive to offers for Wharton. However, the club are not prepared to let the defender walk away for nothing next summer.",
      "Following Palace's Community Shield victory last weekend, chairman Steve Parish said: \"Players come and go in football clubs, you know, I mean, it's a life cycle isn't it? Hopefully they're still here. That's what I'd like but we'll see.\"",
      "In the meantime, Palace are reportedly eyeing up Elliott as a potential replacement for Eze, who has caught the attention of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Eze's release clause is set at £68m, but it s claimed to be expiring on Friday.",
      "Should Palace part ways with just one of Eze or Guehi, the Eagles might be more inclined to consider bids for Wharton. However, if both Guehi and Eze depart, they'll become even more determined to retain the midfielder and will boast a stronger financial position following potential transfer fees for the duo.",
      "The 21-year-old has garnered widespread praise since his switch to Selhurst Park from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024, although injury setbacks hampered his campaign last term, limiting him to just 20 league outings.",
      "The defensive midfielder shares the same age as Baleba, who has likewise caught the eye in the Premier League since his move to Brighton from Lille two years ago. His boss, Fabian Hurzeler, dismissed speculation that Baleba was set to depart the club after he sat out Brighton's friendly against Wolfsburg due to a minor knee problem.",
      "\"He trained today, he trained yesterday,\" Hurzeler said. \"So we don't want to take any risks, but he will be back.\"",
      "United are eager to bolster their midfield ranks ahead of the forthcoming season. Amorim chiefly turned to Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield last campaign.",

      "The Red Devils have also been linked with a move for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced his acrimonious exit from the French champions on Wednesday after being shunned by Luis Enrique. Donnarumma could well join City instead but United have also been linked with other big-money moves, including for Emiliano Martinez and Adam Wharton.",
      "The two potential incomings were discussed on the return of The Overlap's Rest is Football podcast, as Keane took aim at United's possible further expenditure. \"If United were to get him [Donnarumma] and there's talk of Baleba from Brighton which I can't believe,\" Gary Neville began saying.",
      "After the Irishman asked how United would get the money to pay for Donnarumma and Baleba, Jamie Carragher piped in and said: \"I thought they were going bankrupt. They were months away from going bust weren't they?\"",
      "The Liverpool legend referenced Ratcliffe's claim earlier this year, where he said the club would have run out of money by Christmas this year if he hadn't introduced several rounds of redundancies and cut back on staff meals to save money.",
      "\"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put £232.72m ($300m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer, he told the BBC. \"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans.",
      "\"The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\" In jest, Keane responded with: \"Are the staff gonna get their sandwiches back?\" It was in February that it was announced that free lunches for staff at Old Trafford and Carrington were removed, as well as the closure of the staff canteen at the stadium.",
      "While Keane said United's struggling midfield will receive some respite due to the ability of the new attackers to be on the front foot, it remains an issue for Amorim. The ex-United skipper said: \"There's slightly less pressure on their midfield, don't get me wrong, but that will be the problem that'll still hold them back over the next year or two unless they bring in players.",
      "\"But they have to start somewhere. They weren't going to bring seven or eight players.\" When asked by Neville whether he believes they could pull off a move for Baleba, Keane said there's one main reason a deal won't be done.",
      "\"I'd be surprised if it happens,\" he said. \"I still think he's got to do a bit more. It's still potential. You can't pay £100m for a player that you don't know where it's going to go.\" Amorim's new-look United attack will face an immediate acid test as the Red Devils' campaign commences on Sunday when they host Arsenal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United may have finally found a route out of Old Trafford for Jadon Sancho but it will come at significant cost. Serie A giants Roma have launched a £20million bid for the England international — a figure more than £50m short of what they paid for the winger in 2021.",
      "Sancho's four-year spell at United has not seen him find the success many anticipated. A falling out with Erik ten Hag in 2023/24 saw him return to Borussia Dortmund on loan before he spent last season at Chelsea.",
      "The Blues had an obligation to make his move to Stamford Bridge permanent but opted to pay a £5m penalty to see him return to United. Sancho has not been part of Ruben Amorim's first-team set-up this summer and has trained separately as he attempts to broker a move to a new club.",
      "Juventus had been hotly linked with securing a move for the 25-year-old who has just one year remaining on his contract. The Turin-based team have not been forthcoming in getting a deal over the line however, with one Italian chief suggesting players would need to be sold to coutenance a deal.",
      "United have already been forced to admit they will sell Sancho for less than £25m this summer, while Roma could also be interested in a loan deal, per BBC. That would contain clauses to be triggered at the end of the season but is complicated by Sancho's contract situation.",
      "The Red Devils have an option to extend the star's deal by a further year but his significant salary places some doubt over whether United would be willing to action such a move. Sancho was willing to half his wages in order to facilitate a move to Juventus, but the Old Lady were able to offer the lure of Champions League football, Roma are unable to provide the same incentive.",
      "Sancho is one of a number of players United have been unable to get off their books so far this summer. The ex-Manchester City youth product has been kept away from first team operations along with Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The latter is hoping for a move to Chelsea having agreed personal terms but a fee has not yet been agreed between clubs. Antony meanwhile is holding out for a transfer to Real Betis but has been handed an ultimatum by United to make a move more quickly with the La Liga side planning on waiting until the very end of the summer window.",
      "United boss Amorim has suggested that group could yet return to his plans. \"Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team,\" said Amorim earlier in the summer.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",

      "Gary Neville has warned Manchester United that they risk missing out on European football unless they sign a new goalkeeper. The pundit believes that Ruben Amorim must upgrade on Andre Onana in the final weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have been busy in the transfer market, with Benjamin Sesko joining the ranks and potentially forming part of a new-look front three under Amorim. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who netted a combined 35 league goals for Wolves and Brentford last season, have also arrived at Old Trafford.",
      "United are eyeing a move for Brighton's highly-rated midfielder Carlos Baleba as they look to bolster another area of their squad. However, Neville insists that without a new number one - amid links to PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma - United could fall short of their ambitions.",
      "\"You've got to get a goalkeeper. If you've got a goalkeeper and a midfield player, I think fifth or sixth will be achievable,\" Neville stated on the Stick to Football podcast. \"I think without a goalkeeper, it's eighth or ninth.",
      "\"That is the number one most difficult position in English football, Manchester United goalkeeper. I think it's the most scrutiny that anybody comes under.\"",
      "As for potential replacements for current first-choice Andre Onana, Neville suggested: \"Donnarumma or [Emi] Martinez. When they said about Martinez from Villa earlier in the season, I wanted him. His personality. He's got guts. He's got that presence.\"",
      "Martinez appeared poised to depart Villa this summer following tearful scenes towards the end of last season at Villa Park, but he seems to be remaining with Unai Emery's squad. Meanwhile, Onana has endured substantial scrutiny since joining United as David De Gea's replacement in 2023, though he has won the FA Cup and reached the Europa League final during his time at the club.",
      "Donnarumma has surfaced as a potential target for United late in the transfer window following his recent dispute with PSG. The Italian shot-stopper was omitted from the club's UEFA Super Cup triumph over Tottenham Hotspur and the 26-year-old posted what appeared to be a goodbye message to PSG supporters on social media.",
      "\"From the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team's success. I am disappointed and disheartened.",
      "\"I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn't happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.\"",
      "Donnarumma is in the final year of his deal and has yet to pen fresh terms, leading PSG to snap up Lille shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier during the transfer window. However, United's cross-city rivals Manchester City could possibly make a move for Donnarumma, despite welcoming James Trafford back to provide competition for Ederson.",
      "PSG's choice to axe Donnarumma from their Super Cup squad suggests the keeper is set to depart the French giants. When asked about his client's future, Donnarumma's agent Enzo Raiola didn't dismiss the prospect of a switch to England.",
      "\"Gigio is very disappointed, I'm shocked, I didn't expect this from PSG,\" Raiola said, as reported by Gazzetta dello Sport. \"We've had so many seasons of respect and success, a castle of four years has collapsed in ten days.",
      "\"The situation went on for a long time because PSG had offered lower terms in the spring, which Gigio had accepted out of respect for the club and the fans. However, in March-April, once we had decided to move forward together, the club changed the rules again. So we preferred to talk about it again after the Champions League final.",
      "\"We spoke again after the [Club] World Cup, they confirmed the situation, and I replied that Gigio would respect his contract but would not renew. Then, in the last ten days, PSG changed everything again. It's a lack of respect, beyond the technical decisions the coach talks about, and in the coming days we will also discuss with my lawyers how to address the situation.",
      "\"We will consider solutions now, maybe in the Premier League there will be clubs able to pay what's needed. Paris Saint-Germain are asking for big money. They talk about respect, but it's only about the money.\"",

      "Wrexham co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac have been handed a reality check on the extent of their popularity. The two actors have taken the football world by storm since buying the Welsh club in February 2021.",
      "The Red Dragons have registered three promotions in a row, lifting them from the National League to the Championship. Wrexham have also attracted a global fanbase after their achievements were highlighted on the Welcome to Wrexham documentary.",
      "However, while supporters in the North Wales city are more than happy to have the A-list pair on board, a new poll shows not every fanbase would be. Betfair's annual 'Nation Predicts' survey shows 66 per cent of more than 2,000 football lovers questioned wouldn't be interested in Reynolds and Mac owning their club.",
      "Liverpool and Newcastle supporters were most against the idea of Hollywood ownership. The findings of the poll conducted by YouGov Sport are perhaps unsurprising given the two clubs' relative satisfaction with their current owners, who are also far richer than the Wrexham pair.",
      "The Reds lifted the Premier League title last season and a summer of big spending has followed under owners Fenway Sports Group. Meanwhile, Newcastle, backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, clinched their first piece of major silverware since 1969 by winning the Carabao Cup.",
      "Manchester United fans were the most receptive to the idea of Reynolds and Mac taking the helm, with 27 per cent supportive of the prospect, compared to 56 per cent against. That could potentially be down to significant discontent with the Glazer family's ownership and, more recently, the partial takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Surprisingly, 69 per cent of Tottenham supporters were against the notion of the Hollywood duo taking charge, with only 21 per cent in favour. That's despite Spurs fans often voicing their anger at chairman Daniel Levy over the club's fortunes in recent years.",
      "While supporters of Premier League sides might turn their noses up at Reynolds and Mac, who recently filed to legally change his surname from McElhenney, their stock in Wrexham remains as high as ever. And former England goalkeeper Nigel Martyn also believes that celebrity ownership can provide a net benefit for football after highlighting the progress enjoyed by Wrexham and Birmingham City, who are part-owned by NFL legend Tom Brady.",
      "Speaking to Parimatch, Martyn said: \"I think it's been a breath of fresh air if I'm totally honest. Seeing things like the Wrexham documentary on television and how open they've been with everything is great for the game.",
      "\"They're popular people and while Ryan Reynolds is somebody that most people think, 'Yeah, he looks like he's a nice guy and he's funny,' both he and Rob McElhenney are serious about how they run the football club as well.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "\"You won't hear anyone in Wrexham say a bad thing about them, I wouldn't imagine, because they've turned them around from a team that had been out of the Football League to one which I expect to see pushing into the higher echelons and the Premier League. It's been tremendous.",
      "\"Anything that boosts the club and the standing of your club in a positive way is a good thing. To have Tom Brady at Birmingham City, for Birmingham fans, it makes them stick their chest out a little bit further and say, 'Look who we've got now.'\"",
      "He added: \"So far, Wrexham have done it tremendously well and Birmingham appear to be making progress. In all honesty, it doesn't matter how much money you throw at it, there is no guarantee that you're going to win the league. But, so far, both teams have bounced up the leagues pretty well.",
      "\"Fair play to them, it's going to be interesting but I think it's a positive thing, definitely, and celebrity ownership, with people trying to copy Wrexham and Birmingham, is probably something we'll see more and more and more of.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",

      "Instead the 21-year-old is set to join the Baggies as he looks to aid their Championship promotion push and his own personal development, reports the Athletic. The likes of Harvey Barnes have previously excelled after spending time on loan at the Hawthorns.",
      "Several second tier clubs were keen on Collyer but West Brom, where Ryan Mason is now manager, look to have won the race, which puts pay to Brighton's hopes of re-signing the midfielder.",
      "The United star was part of their pre-season trip to the United States and admitted he was ready to talk with club bosses over what was best for all parties. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan,\" he said.",
      "Collyer came through the ranks at Brighton before leaving in 2022 and those in Manchester were surprised when the chance to sign him came up. He was considered one of the best midfielders in his age group and United jumped at the chance to snap him up.",
      "Collyer was born in Worthing, just 10 miles from Brighton, and was destined for a first-team spot at the Amex until he was released. Ruben Amorim's system in Manchester only allows for two midfielders to play - and one of those is likely to be captain and talisman Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Manchester United's meeting with Arsenal is the headline clash on the Premier League's opening weekend but up to six players could miss the contest at Old Trafford with the hosts sweating on the fitness of Andre Onana.",
      "The goalkeeper has been missing throughout pre-season and has long been in a race against time to get back for the first game of the season. A hamstring issue has sidelined him, leaving Altay Bayindir to step in during the interim period.",
      "The Turkish shotstopper may have to continue against the Gunners, the team he performed heroics against in an FA Cup final win last year. But earlier this month Onana issued a positive update and suggested he could play. He said: “I feel good, I feel great. It’s been a few difficult weeks, but yeah, hopefully, I will be back for the start of the season.”",
      "Ruben Amorim stands to be without several members of his defensive unit with Lisandro Martinez still injured. The Argentine has struggled for fitness for some time and whilst he travelled to the US for pre-season, no timeframe is given on his return.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui hasn't been pictured in training for some time after being forced off at half-time during United’s pre-season opener against Leeds in Stockholm last month. His injury has not been specified but his lack of appearance does not spell good news.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, one player who has been linked with a move away from Manchester amid all the new faces in attack, is touch and go to play against the Gunners. The Dutchman claimed in July that he was targeting his return for the opening game.",
      "Arsenal meanwhile, who drew this fixture last season, will want to get off to the best possible start with Mikel Arteta's side potentially including a number of their new recruits. Viktor Gyokeres is likely to lead the line, which is a plus given Gabriel Jesus remains sidelined with a serious knee injury.",
      "The Brazilian has been out since the early part of 2025 and it meant Arsenal were struggling for players to spearhead their attack, motivating their pursuit of Gyokeres. Leandro Trossard is one player who has done that when required but the Belgian too is struggling for fitness.",
      "He was absent from the squad on Saturday as Arsenal beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in their final pre-season friendly, but Arteta is quietly confident he could him available. “He had a little niggle in the groin - but he should be fine,\" said the Arsenal boss.",

      "England's competition is the most popular globally but all of the matches are played in the UK and that is not set to change. Italy, alongside Spain, have signalled their plan to take a domestic match abroad and are seeking permission from FIFA and UEFA.",
      "It could mean that the Serie A sees AC Milan and Como facing off in Perth, Australia in February. Other one-off matches like the Italian Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup have also been played abroad in recent years.",
      "The Premier League is much more driven by tradition as opposed to some of the other major sporting competitions. Staging NFL games outside of America is now common practice and hugely lucrative but that is not currently on the agenda from a football stand point.",
      "Masters told the BBC: \"I don't think it changes the Premier League's view on this at all, we don't have any plans to play matches abroad. It's not anywhere near my in-tray and it's not a debate around our table.\"",
      "The idea of the Premier League playing an extra round - which became known as the '39th game' - outside England was raised in 2008 but those plans were binned amid huge backlash from fans.",
      "Former Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claimed a decade ago that clubs were keen on the idea, but Masters insists that is not forthcoming despite the amount of American interest in the Premier League. There are 11 US-owned clubs in the top flight, putting them close to the two-thirds majority of 14 that is needed to bring about changes to the Premier League's rules.",
      "Masters added: \"The first thing to say is it hasn't happened yet. You need a whole bunch of things to happen. The Premier League flirted with this over a decade ago and the reason was to grow the league internationally and we were able to do this through different means - digital means, broadcast partners, concepts like the summer series in the US. The necessity that was driving that concept has dissipated.\"",

      "\"I still think they [United] need one or two more signings,\" said the Old Trafford icon. \"But I think you can see what Amorim is doing. I think it's looking better for Manchester United, and I think they will sneak into the top five. I hope they do, you never know.\"",
      "Laurens was quick to tease Rooney about his obvious bias given his 559 appearances for United. The Red Devils face a monumental challenge in regaining their Champions League credentials, especially after consecutive seasons of setting new records for new all-time worst league finishes.",
      "\"Who did you play for again?\" quipped Laurens, leaving Rooney and the rest of the panel in stitches over his potentially biased perspective. Despite his Everton and United roots, Rooney didn't let his loyalties cloud his judgement as he predicted Liverpool would retain their title.",
      "Moreover, he believes that if Arne Slot's team manage to secure Isak, they're a sure bet for the crown. The Newcastle forward is currently at loggerheads with the club after it was revealed the Swede is determined he has played his last match for the Magpies, keenly awaiting another offer from Liverpool following a rejected £120million bid.",
      "\"I already had Liverpool as favourites to win the title this year,\" Rooney admitted. \"But if Isak comes in, then I think they're gonna be unstoppable.",
      "\"The quality they've got, as Danny's just alluded [to], and I think a big thing was replacing Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. There's a lot of chances created, a lot of goals came from that side. I think [Jeremie] Frimpong has got the attributes to fill that, so I think Liverpool look strong.\"",
      "Rooney could only grin as he spoke the words, though it wasn't one of joy. Rather it seemed to pain the pundit to heap such praise on his old nemeses, regardless of how well-deserved the praise might be.",
      "Many pundits echo this sentiment as the new season approaches, especially with Liverpool bolstering their squad with talents like Florian Wirtz and Huge Ekitike. However, Slot's men may not find immediate success after Crystal Palace snatched the Community Shield at Wembley on Saturday.",
      "Rooney also predicted Arsenal will secure the Premier League's runner-up spot for the fourth consecutive year. He also tipped Manchester City and Chelsea to round out the top four.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford says Frenkie de Jong has been helping him communicate to his new Barcelona team-mates. The former long-time Manchester United target's English-speaking skills were highlighted when Rashford opened up about his experience settling in at Barcelona.",
      "The forward was left out of United’s first-team training sessions during pre-season by head coach Ruben Amorim, after a falling out last December led to him being exiled from the squad and sent out on loan to Aston Villa until the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The England international, 27, finally secured his dream move to Barcelona last month, albeit only on loan until the end of this campaign. Rashford has impressed for his new side in pre-season and appears to be settling in smoothly, registering a goal and two assists in four appearances for the reigning Spanish champions.",
      "Playing an important role in that process has been none other than Dutch midfielder De Jong, who once upon a time might have ended up at Old Trafford himself.",
      "Rashford was asked by Gary Lineker on the latest episode of The Rest Is Football podcast what the main language in the Barcelona dressing room is, having previously been Spanish and Catalan during Lineker’s time with the club in the late-1980s.",
      "Rashford began by saying: “It’s still Spanish, a lot of the lads speak Catalan, but the easy thing for me is that a lot of the lads understand English. So I’ve just been picking up on the basics on the pitch, which I think I’ve done quite quickly.”",
      "Rashford, who used Duolingo to improve his Spanish over the summer and has begun taking in-person lessons since his move to Catalonia, went on to explain De Jong’s role in helping him settle in.",
      "He added: “There are good people who are like a bridge. Frenkie [de Jong] speaks really good English, Jules [Kounde] speaks very good English, but they also have good Spanish because they’ve been here a few years.",
      "“But on the pitch, honestly it’s easier than what I thought it would be. Also football overall, I know a lot of people say it, but it’s a language in itself and it’s easy to communicate through the general vibe on the pitch.”",
      "De Jong during Erik ten Hag’s stint as United manager was frequently linked with the Red Devils, which may provide one explanation for his excellent English-speaking skills. Talks were reportedly held between the club and player in the summer of 2022 but De Jong was said to be reluctant due to United’s lack of Champions League football and his desire to remain in Barcelona.",
      "United and Barcelona reportedly even agreed an initial deal worth around £56million, indicating that the Spanish giants were willing to cash in on the midfielder, only for De Jong to refuse a move and United to bring in Casemiro instead.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest was sporadically mentioned the following year, with loose reports of some reignited interest. De Jong, whose current deal runs until 2026, shut down any further speculation this year by telling Sports Illustrated he hopes to renew his contract until 2029.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Liverpool have been tipped to retain their Premier League title by Opta's supercomputer with their algorithm giving the Reds a 28.5 per cent chance of going back-to-back for the first time.",
      "Arne Slot's side won the title relatively unchallenged last term and those on Merseyside and now hoping to claim successive Premier League crowns for the first time ever. Arsenal are backed to be their closest challengers.",
      "Unfortunately for the Gunners though they've been backed to finish second for a fourth season on the trot. Their likelihood of winning the title has been ranked at 24.3 per cent. In keeping with last season's table, Manchester City have been tipped to finish third.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have invested in a bid to return back to the summit of English football, but the Catalan will go two years without a title for the first time in England if Opta is to be believed. They have an 18.8 per cent chance of success.",
      "Manchester United are hoping for a resurgence after a pre-season under Ruben Amorim and more than £200million of new signings, which includes Benjamin Sesko. However the Opta algorithm believes it will be another mid-table season for the Red Devils with 12th their predicted finish.",
      "At the other end of the table the concerning Premier League trend may continue. Opta's stats believe that Sunderland, Leeds and Burnley will all go straight back down with the Black Cats propping up the table. It would be the third year in successive all the promoted teams go back down.",
      "Wolves are the side tipped to struggle the most, but they will occupy the 17th spot so many teams covet. In fact their likelihood of relegation is just 7.3 per cent. Which is minimal when compared to Burnley (16.6), Leeds (17.8) and Sunderland (34.1).",
      "Chelsea are the team tipped to round out the top four. However the Blues hopes of becoming champions has been largely dismissed, given just an 8.4 per cent chance of finishing top which represents a major drop from the top three.",
      "Their London rivals Tottenham are eyeing a major rebuild under Thomas Frank but few strides are made on last season's difficult year. They remain behind the Red Devils with Opta handing them a finishing position of 14th - which is below Frank's former sider Brentford.",
      "Despite the wholesale changes and the loss of one of their best players the Bees are tipped to finish in tenth, which represents an impressive year given the loss of talent they have had to deal with.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the Premier League's surprise package but Opta has not backed them to replicate those lofty heights. European football could place more strain on their resources with a bottom half finish predicted.",
      "Crystal Palace are likely to be buoyed by the supercomputer's take on their season with the Eagles sat in seventh. That would likely mean European football once again as Oliver Glasner continues to take the club forward, albeit that may be dependent on them keeping their best players.",
      "Aston Villa and Newcastle remain part of the European picture, but there is a change to the order. Unai Emery's side nab fifth place, which could mean a return to the Champions League. The Magpies meanwhile drop to sixth which would be a blow.",

      "The U21 side were playing at the Lamb Ground on Wednesday night but Kone suffered a serious injury following a clash of heads with an opponent in his own box. It led to Kone receiving treatment on the pitch for around 15 minutes.",
      "The 19-year-old, who is a Mali youth international, had to be taken off on a stretcher with a mask placed on his face. An announcement later came that the match had been called off.",

      "A statement on Tamworth’s social media account said: “Due to the medical situation, we are forced to abandon tonight’s fixture, details will be revealed in due course. We would like to wish safe travels to all the Man United fans, staff and players. We especially wish Sékou Koné a speedy recovery.”",

      "Besiktas are hoping to complete a deal to sign United outcast Jadon Sancho after several of his other exit routes appear to have closed. Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, but they turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, and despite agreeing terms with Fenerbahce and Juventus, those deals collapsed at the final hurdle.",
      "But Besiktas president Serdal Adali has come out and made his plans known after huge fan demand for his signature - a move that would also see Sancho reunite with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the man who bought him to Manchester.",
      "“Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” he told Turkiye Today. “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here. Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”",

      "The 22-year-old Dane has been cast aside by Ruben Amorim towards the end of pre-season and the arrival of new striker Benjamin Sesko has pushed him even further down the pecking order. It was in Italy with Atalanta that Hojlund first made his name.",
      "Barcelona loanee hasn't been shy in speaking his mind about his parent club and claims the constant changing of manager's and strategies has been a major problem and urged them to stick by Amorim. A host of managers have been allowed to sign their own players to suit their own systems - and Marcus Rashford insists that has not been beneficial.",
      "He told The Rest is Football podcast: “To start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it. This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. We’ve had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no man’s land.”",

      "Although nothing is finalised, Sheffield Wednesday are thought to be leading the race to sign Amass and it's understood United would be happy to send the youngster to Hillsborough Stadium.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been in turmoil over the last few months due to problems with the club's owner, Dejphon Chansiri. The Owls were handed a transfer embargo for their failure to pay players and staff, but the embargo has been lifted and they have pitched to sign Amass on loan for 2025/2026.",
      "Despite the unrest at Sheffield Wednesday, United sources have indicated that game time is the priority when considering a loan offer and Amass would benefit from consistent starts.",
      "Amass is understood to be weighing up his options, but United have no qualms about potentially sending him on loan to Sheffield Wednesday and would green-light a move to S6.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday started the Championship season with only 16 registered first-team players after several departures and supporters have protested against the club's ownership.",
      "Last weekend, Sheffield Wednesday fans walked into their game against Leicester City late to protest against Chansiri, and further protests are planned before facing Stoke on Saturday.",
      "The Sheffield Wednesday Supporters' Trust has encouraged fans not to buy other merchandise or food at the ground, while supporters have boycotted the new home and away kit.",
      "After internal discussions and the arrival of Diego Leon this summer, Amass was earmarked for a loan move. Ruben Amorim handed Amass his first-team debut against Leicester in March and the youngster made a total of seven first-team appearances throughout the campaign.",
      "Amass was named on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham. He was subsequently considered to stay with the first-team for the new season, but Leon has impressed in pre-season.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Paraguay club Cerro Porteno to sign Leon, who was due to be assessed this summer before a decision was made on his future.",
      "Leon made a strong first impression at Carrington and was handed a first-team squad number before the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm. Amorim started Leon in that friendly and he made substitute appearances against West Ham and Bournemouth in the United States.",

      "Ahead of the visit of Mikel Arteta's side, United's players and staff are continuing to put the hard yards in at Carrington, and here are five things we spotted from Wednesday's training session:",
      "The weather has been glorious in Manchester this week, meaning Ruben Amorim's players have been gearing up for Sunday's curtain-raiser in sweltering conditions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The sun has been beaming down on the club's training ground, meaning United's players have been pushed to the maximum. The weather forecast for Sunday says temperatures could reach as high as 26 degrees Celsius.",

      "Every substitute from the 1-1 draw with Fiorentina was accounted for except for striker Rasmus Hojlund. It felt somewhat significant amid United's efforts to offload him to AC Milan.",
      "However, he was pictured training alongside the rest of his teammates on Wednesday, meaning he remains in contention to be included in the squad for Sunday's game.",
      "It wouldn't be a United training session without a youngster or two involved. It has become a regular theme at Carrington in recent years, and Amorim has not shied away from giving some of United's most promising talent a chance to catch the eye.",
      "After going on the pre-season tour of the United States, both Tyler Fredricson and Jack Fletcher are continuing to train with United's senior figures. It was confirmed on Wednesday the latter was working with the first-team squad.",
      "Fredricson, 20, was given his senior debut by Amorim towards the end of last season, starting United's Premier League defeats to Wolves and Brentford. Fletcher is still waiting to make his competitive bow for the club, but was named on the bench seven times last term.",
      "With just three days to go until the opening game of the season, it is looking increasingly likely Noussair Mazraoui will miss out. Just as he was on Sunday, the Moroccan was absent from the pictures published from Wednesday's session.",
      "The defender has been missing since United's 0-0 draw with Leeds United in Stockholm almost a month ago, failing to play a single minute of their tour of the United States. He is currently nursing an injury and the last image published of him by United in training was on July 25.",
      "The Moroccan was a key player for the Reds last season, racking up 57 appearances in all competitions.",
      "The start of a new season always brings fresh optimism and hope. After a successful summer both on and off the pitch, United's players have every right to be in an upbeat mood ahead of the clash with Arsenal.",

      "It is a busy day ahead for the Reds with this man back under the microscope...",
      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer is closing in on a loan move to West Bromwich Albion.",
      "According to The Independent, Manchester United United are pushing to sign Carlos Baleba before the transfer window slams shut on September 1. The report claims that Ruben Amorim wants to sign a midfielder this summer, and Adam Wharton has been identified as an alternative to the Brighton ace.",
      "It's said that United would, ideally, like both, but Crystal Palace are expected to be even more difficult to deal with than the Seagulls.",
      "Manchester United would allow Harry Amass to join Sheffield Wednesday on loan for regular game time.",
      "Although nothing is finalised, Wednesday are thought to be leading the race to sign Amass and it's understood United would be happy to send the youngster to Hillsborough Stadium.",
      "Despite the off-the-field unrest at Wednesday, United sources have indicated that game time is the priority when considering a loan offer and Amass would benefit from consistent starts.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano on his YouTube channel, Brighton have deployed the same negotiation tactic they used to offload Moises Caicedo, to Chelsea, on Manchester United for Carlos Baleba.",
      "The journalist said: \"For Carlos Baleba, the contacts are still ongoing. This is a difficult deal for Manchester United, not just financially but also in terms of strategy.",
      "\"What is important to mention is Manchester United are still there, still in contact with the agents, still working on a deal. They want to understand how high is the wall from Brighton but they are still working on the Carlos Baleba.\"",
      "Romano added: \"They are not giving up. Difficult? Yes. Very difficult? Of course. But, United are still there.",
      "\"The player is not closing the doors at all. Personal terms are not a problem, European football for Baleba is not a problem. He'd go to United immediately and I can guarantee that. But club to club, we are still far from a solution...\"",
      "Fulham are showing 'tentative interest' in signing Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund, according to the Daily Mail. Marco Silva's side are weighing up a move for the Denmark international as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject to offers from Serie A side Atalanta.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United for Hojlund and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. However, the 22-year-old has made it clear that he wants to fight for his place at Old Trafford, despite the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last week.",
      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has been given until the weekend by Besiktas to make a decision about their offer before they turn their attention elsewhere, as per journalist Secan Dikme, via Sports Digitale. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are said to have 'gotten tired' of waiting for Sancho this summer.",
      "They're yet to hold negotiations with United about him but if they don't receive a response, they will turn their attention to other options. The pressure is now on Sancho to make up his mind.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand has advised Hojlund to leave Old Trafford this summer to provide himself with further experience.",
      "I think Rasmus Hojlund has to go on loan. I think if I was him, I’d definitely want to go out on loan, minimum – fresh start. Italy. He knows the place and did good out there. I think it would be a good move for him. What could happen when he comes back? Who knows?",
      "Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho has now agreed terms with Chelsea, according to journalist Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport.",
      "The 21-year-old is 'waiting' for a move to Stamford Bridge, as club-to-club talks are advanced.",
      "United insist on receiving at least £50m for Garnacho, as the Reds argue that he should not be sold for much less than the £52m Chelsea got for Noni Madueke, who made the move to Arsenal last month.",
      "However, Chelsea are aware that United need to sell players, especially if they want to pull off a record-breaking deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba before the end of the transfer window.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, following a summer which has seen him be linked and ultimately reject a move to Saudi Arabia, Fernandes has set out his goals for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "I hope you'll hear less about Bruno this year, but a lot more about United. That's my main objective because my name being spoken, let's say vaguely alone, it doesn't fill me with pride or anything. United being talked about, being positive, that's the most important thing and that's what I want for this season. If it happens that Bruno has to score fewer goals, provide less assists or do another type of provision of what is necessary for the games, I would be very happy.",
      "Roma have submitted an official bid to Manchester United to sign Jadon Sancho, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Serie A side have offered £20million to United for the 25-year-old's services.",
      "I Giallorossi are also open to a loan to buy deal for Sancho, should that be United's preference. The Reds, however, are keen to offload the England international on a permanent basis.",
      "Gian Piero Gasperini's men are in contact with both Sancho and Aston Villa's Leon Bailey, as they look to strengthen out wide before the end of the summer.",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, has 'opened the doors' to a move to Roma and is prepared to make the switch to Italy for the next step of his career.",
      "While there is scepticism that a deal for Baleba can be sorted between now and September 1, Fabrizio Romano believes that derives from club to club negotiations rather than the 21-year-old's preferences to the move.",
      "Romano claims he 'guarantees' that Baleba would agree a move to Old Trafford quickly if a fee could be agreed.",
      "However, agreeing said sum is still far down the line.",
      "Explaining the latest situation in a Q&A, The Athletic's Laurie Whitwell has discussed the possibility of signing Baleba this summer.",
      "The journalist believes that there is a level of scepticism on both sides that the deal will be done this summer.",
      "If that's the case, it could be time to look at some alternatives that have been mentioned previously.",
      "Along with Wharton and Baleba, it is believed that Atalanta's Ederson and Sporting's Morten Hjulmand are being considered by the Reds.",
      "Ederson has been heavily linked with the Reds for some time now and has yet to move from the Italian club.",
      "Hjulmand, meanwhile, has a long-standing relationship with Amorim after they worked together in Lisbon previously.",
      "Accompanying their update on Amorim's stance, The Independent adds that United see Wharton as an alternative target this summer.",
      "Eventually, the dream scenario would be to play Baleba alongside Wharton but Crystal Palace are expected to be even trickier to negotiate with.",
      "It is believed Steve Parish has no interest in potentially losing Wharton, on top of Guehi and Eze before the window closes.",
      "The Independent understands that Amorim is pushing hard for Baleba to join his team.",
      "He sees the Cameroonian as being a player who could complete his midfield this summer and add more bite to the centre of the pitch.",
      "However, there are alternatives that could be considered to bolster United.",
      "Amid the ongoing reports that United want to sign the Brighton midfielder Baleba, the Daily Telegraph understands that the Seagulls have set a price tag of £100m for him.",
      "It has long been thought that Brighton will value the central midfielder the same as Moises Caicedo who left them to join Chelsea for £115m.",
      "Unsurprisingly, it is believed that United will not want to purchase Baleba at that price.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be with you until 4pm bringing you all the latest United news as and when we get it.",
      "To kick things off, we are going to begin by looking at the latest surrounding this man and his potential move to Old Trafford...",
      "Roma have reportedly bid to sign Jadon Sancho on loan this season.",
      "The Times claims they want to sign the winger and Aston Villa player Leon Bailey, whom they are said to have enquired about. United understandably would prefer a permanent move with Sancho in the final year of his contract.",
      "Manchester United youngster Toby Collyer is closing in on a loan move to West Bromwich Albion.",
      "MORE: United midfielder makes decision on future",
      "Kingsley Coman is said to be signing for Al Nassr soon after years of links to United.",
      "Their interest in Coman dates back to 2020, with the winger understood to have been an alternative to Jadon Sancho. Sky Germany now reports Bayern Munich are now belatedly selling the France international.",
      "Hull City head coach Sergej Jakirovic has confirmed talks with Toby Collyer.",
      "The midfielder is a long-term loan target of theirs and Jakirovic has told Hull Live:",
      "We're waiting now for a decision from Man United and Toby as well. I'm waiting for the answer in the next one or two days.",
      "Bayern Munich are said to have made Christopher Nkunku one of the leading names on their shortlist after previous links to United.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims the situation is open, acknowledging several clubs have asked about the Chelsea player this summer. Any move to Bayern now reputedly depends on the cost of doing business.",
      "Milan are reportedly prepared to pay £34million as part of a deal for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "La Gazzetta Dello Sport claims it would include an initial loan fee and an option to buy the striker. However, they add that Hojlund wants guarantees from Milan that a permanent move will materialise next summer.",
      "United are said to have shown late interest in Giovanni Leoni before Liverpool agreed an initial £26million deal with Parma.",
      "The Times claims that other Premier League sides, with Newcastle United another one named, did likewise, with the Reds also credited with beating Milan and Inter to the teenage central defender.",
      "United are reportedly willing to include Jadon Sancho in a deal to sign Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Independent, however, claims Brighton & Hove Albion are unlikely to accept such a proposal, instead wanting around £120million. United are said to be considering a £80million initial offer, paying the other £40m in add-ons.",
      "Milan are reportedly prepared to match the wages Rasmus Hojlund is currently on at United.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim the Italian club are now trying to reach a financial agreement with the striker. Negotiations are reputedly ongoing on a loan with an option to make the move permanent for Hojlund.",
      "Nineteen days remain of this summer transfer window, with the Premier League season just one more sleep away. We will update you on all the latest reports about United's potential business in the market throughout today."

      "United's Under-21s visited Tamworth in the National League Cup on Wednesday evening, but the game was abandoned due to a head injury sustained by Kone at the end of the first half.",
      "Kone was taken to hospital in an ambulance and so with no ambulance on-site the game had to be abandoned. United have now confirmed Kone was discharged on Thursday morning and is continuing his recovery at home.",
      "The 19-year-old sustained the head injury after a clash with a Tamworth player from a corner. Kone initially stood to his feet, but went back to the ground under advice from medical staff. He was subsequently taken off the pitch on a stretcher.",
      "The Mali youth international was making his first competitive appearance of the season against Tamworth. Ruben Amorim named Kone in the USA pre-season tour squad, but the youngster didn't make an appearance.",

      "Ryan Mason is hoping to lead West Brom back to the Premier League after his appointment at The Hawthorns in June. West Brom last competed in the topflight in 2020/21.",
      "Collyer attracted intense Championship interest after breaking into the first-team at Old Trafford last season. The 21-year-old made his Premier League debut against Liverpool in September and made 13 senior appearances in total.",
      "Last summer, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",

      "Manchester United have strengthened Ruben Amorim's squad in the summer transfer window, but there is an area that hasn't been addressed ahead of the opening game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "You don't win any prizes for guessing it's the midfield. United have signed a striker, two forwards for the No.10 roles and a left-back, but have not secured a fresh face for the engine room.",
      "That has the potential to be problematic and immediately exposed against Arsenal, who have two of the Premier League's finest midfielders, Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard, alongside new addition Martín Zubimendi.",
      "There is positivity at Old Trafford ahead of the new campaign and United deserve huge credit for their business so far, but it's impossible to shake a feeling that they need a new midfielder through the door.",
      "Amorim plays with two midfielders in the pivot and his current options have not complemented each other as was hoped. Bruno Fernandes has been used in the pivot, but is playing Fernandes alongside Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo or Casemiro a sustainable option to secure results?",
      "It says a lot about Ugarte that United already need a new player of his ilk, just 12 months after signing him from Paris Saint-Germain. Ugarte's performances have been mixed and he hasn't truly nailed down the role.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, which represented a significant outlay, but United are planning to invest in his position again.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba is on the club's radar but he wouldn't be cheap. Brighton value Baleba at around £100million and they have planned to keep the 21-year-old for another year.",
      "United are expected to test Brighton's stance on the midfielder, but Tony Bloom's outfit are famously good at negotiating and have a strong track record of selling for huge transfer fees.",
      "United will not be enthused about Brighton's valuation of Baleba, but they might be forced to the negotiating table after facing Arsenal this weekend, depending on how the game unfolds at Old Trafford.",
      "Arsenal have quality in the centre of the pitch and will be hopeful of winning the midfield battle. And as a result, that could highlight and emphasise how much United need to sign a new midfielder this summer.",
      "The same thing essentially happened after the first two games of the 2022/2023 season. United lost 2-1 to Brighton and were hammered 4-0 by Brentford, which forced them into action in the transfer market.",
      "The midfield was ruthlessly exploited in those games and Casemiro arrived to provide defensive cover. United are very unlikely to have such a bad start this season, but Arsenal could highlight the chasm with midfield options.",
      "Amorim would obviously prefer to secure a victory rather than to oversee the kind of defeat that would send a message to the board about needing to sign a new midfielder, though.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford will be tremendous on the opening day of the campaign against a historic rival, which means United might be spurred to a victory, even with doubts about their midfield.",
      "However, Amorim needs a new midfielder to be successful this season and he appeared to warn that he needs a new signing when he spoke after the final pre-season friendly last weekend.",
      "Speaking to MUTV, Amorim said: \"I think it was a perfect game for preparation to show us we need to improve in different areas that we are going to struggle in some moments. But sometimes we have players who can make a play and elevate the stadium.\"",
      "It felt obvious that Amorim was referring to the midfield with that answer.",

      "After spending almost £200million already this summer, it remains to be seen just how deep Manchester United's pockets really are.",
      "Following a forgettable 2024/25 campaign, United have been left with no choice but to spend big in this summer's transfer market to improve head coach Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Diego Leon has arrived from Cerro Porteno for £3.3m, Matheus Cunha has joined the club from Wolves for £62.5m, Bryan Mbeumo has checked in from Brentford for £65m and Benjamin Sesko has arrived from RB Leipzig for £66.4m.",
      "Considering United are yet to oversee a single sale this summer, it is fair to say they have done pretty well. And there is still a thirst for more additions.",
      "With just over two weeks of the window remaining, United still want to sign a midfielder and possibly a goalkeeper. Their midfield has been a problem position for many years and they are still on the hunt for a long-term solution.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "It has been well-documented recently that Brighton & Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba has attracted United's attention. The Cameroonian has made rapid progress since joining the Seagulls from Lille two years ago, establishing himself as one of the most highly-rated midfielders in the business.",
      "Capable of providing plenty of energy, winning the ball back, driving forward with the ball and offering a varied passing range, Baleba ticks a plethora of boxes. United need a midfielder who is capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room.",
      "Brighton, of course, are the masters of finding hidden gems, developing them and selling them on for a handsome profit. It is a sustainable model that consistently delivers results.",
      "In Baleba, the Seagulls believe they have discovered the real deal. He has been excellent since joining the club in August 2023, so much so some reports have claimed Brighton will demand north of £100m to consider selling him this summer.",
      "Although United could still bring in a percentage of the reported fee Brighton are set to demand via player sales, amid their hunger to sell Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony before the deadline, it feels unlikely the club will be able to meet the Seagulls' demands.",
      "Despite the increasing probability that Garnacho will join Chelsea, no club has stepped forward with an offer to sign Malacia, Sancho or Antony on a permanent basis. Sancho and Antony both look increasingly likely to leave on loan instead.",
      "With that in mind, United might have to look elsewhere for a suitable midfielder. Although the Reds have preferred to try and target Premier League proven players this summer, there is still a chance they could explore the overseas market.",
      "And one option they could turn to is Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber. The Dutchman has less than a year remaining on his existing contract, meaning the Eredivisie outfit could be open to a cut-price sale.",
      "Timber, whose twin brother, Jurrien, plays for Arsenal, has a similar profile to Baleba in the sense he is a dynamic midfield operator, capable of getting on the ball in the centre of the park and driving his team up the pitch. He is also press resistant and can have an impact in both defensive and offensive situations.",
      "United lack a sense of mobility in midfield, particularly in possession, and Timber can provide that trait. The 24-year-old is renowned for his energy output and ability to drive forward with the ball at his feet.",
      "However, his recent injury record will generate cause for concern. He suffered a serious knee injury in February and that forced him to miss the remainder of the 2024/25 season, meaning he finished last season with just 26 appearances to his name.",
      "Timber previously suffered from a knee problem during the 2022/23 campaign, forcing him to miss around two months worth of action in the second half of the campaign. With a knee issue threatening to become a familiar problem for the Dutchman, that will be something for prospective suitors to bear in mind.",
      "But if he can remain fit, just as he did for the vast majority of the 2023/24 season, there is an exciting player waiting to go up through the gears. In addition to being a brilliant ball carrier, Timber can also flex his muscles in attacking sense, highlighted by his tally of 18 goals and 13 assists for Feyenoord.",
      "With Baleba set to cost an arm and a leg, Timber could be a cheaper alternative to consider.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Manchester United kickstart their new Premier League campaign when they host Arsenal on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's side had a mixed pre-season, winning two and drawing three of their five fixtures, finishing off with a 1-1 stalemate against Fiorentina last Saturday.",
      "But now United's full focus turns to competitive action, with Mikel Arteta's Arsenal first up at Old Trafford. The Reds could have a number of new faces on show, with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha poised to start after arriving from Brentford and Wolves this summer.",
      "Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko is expected to be involved in the United squad following his blockbuster move from RB Leipzig. The 22-year-old might have to settle for a place on the bench after having limited time with the rest of his teammates, but Amorim may throw him into the XI.",
      "While United's immediate attention is on the return of the Premier League, the Reds still have work to do in the transfer market. Several players are expected to leave United before the end of the summer, while one or two may still arrive to strengthen the squad.",
      "Roma have submitted an official bid to United to sign Jadon Sancho, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Serie A side have offered £20million to United for the 25-year-old's services.",
      "Roma are also open to a loan to buy deal for Sancho, should that be United's preference. The Reds, however, are keen to offload the England international on a permanent basis.",
      "Gian Piero Gasperini's men are in contact with both Sancho and Aston Villa's Leon Bailey, as they look to strengthen out wide before the end of the summer. Sancho, meanwhile, has 'opened the doors' to a move to Roma and is prepared to make the switch to Italy for the next step of his career.",
      "MEN says: United need to sell Sancho this summer. The Reds need to get some high earners, such as Sancho, off the wage bill and raise funds to strengthen other areas. As the ex-Borussia Dortmund man doesn't have a future in Ruben Amorim's squad, securing £20m for his services would be an astute piece of business.",
      "For Sancho himself, he could do with getting a permanent move and revitalising his career after a difficult couple of years. Roma, who are in this season's Europa League, have ex-Atalanta manager Gasperini at the helm.",
      "Fulham are showing 'tentative interest' in signing United forward Rasmus Hojlund, according to the Daily Mail. Marco Silva's side are weighing up a move for the Denmark international as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject to offers from Serie A side Atalanta.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United for Hojlund and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. However, the 22-year-old has made it clear that he wants to fight for his place at Old Trafford, despite the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last week.",
      "MEN says: I think that Hojlund is going to struggle for regular game time this season. Sesko is set to be United's first-choice striker, while Amorim could use Fernandes in the false nine role in his absence. It means that Hojlund might not even be the back-up option, meaning that an exit could be the most feasible and best solution.",
      "With Fulham about to lose Muniz, Hojlund would more than likely go in as the Whites' best No.9, though he would face competition from Raul Jimenez. I think that he should consider this move, as it makes sense all-round.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legends Wayne Rooney and Roy Keane have disagreed about who they think will win the Premier League title with Arsenal and Liverpool the two favourites to battle it out for the crown.",
      "Arne Slot's side finished ten points clear of the Gunners in second place, with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City 13 points adrift of the summit in third. Enzo Maresca's Chelsea completed the top four, and a number of big name pundits have waded in on the debate ahead of this weekend's Premier League curtain raisers.",
      "Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has been left impressed by Ruben Amorim's summer transfer window but believes they still need further additions to sneak a top five finish.",
      "\"I still think they need one or two more signings,\" Rooney told the Match of the Day special edition preview. \"But I think you can see what Amorim is doing. I think it's looking better for Manchester United, and I think they will sneak into the top five. I hope they do, you never know.\"",
      "Rooney made it clear he expects Liverpool to retain the title, predicting Arsenal to finish second for the fourth year in a row, with Man City and Chelsea completing the top four.",
      "\"I already had Liverpool as favourites to win the title this year,\" said Rooney. \"But if Isak comes in, then I think they're gonna be unstoppable.",
      "\"The quality they've got, as Danny's just alluded [to], and I think a big thing was replacing Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. There's a lot of chances created, a lot of goals came from that side. I think [Jeremie] Frimpong has got the attributes to fill that, so I think Liverpool look strong.\"",
      "Former United defender Gary Neville believes Amorim's side could finish in fifth or sixth, but stressed the importance of signing one key position.",
      "“You’ve got to get a goalkeeper. If you’ve got a goalkeeper and a midfield player, I think fifth or sixth will be achievable,” Neville argued on the Stick to Football podcast. “I think without a goalkeeper, it’s eighth or ninth.",
      "“That is the number one most difficult position in English football, Manchester United goalkeeper. I think it’s the most scrutiny that anybody comes under.”",
      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher does not believe Liverpool would be automatic title favourites this season even if they sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak. \"Yeah, I think so,\" Carragher replied when asked if the Reds are the favourites.",
      "\"But I don't get this narrative of Liverpool are going to run away with it. If you look at history, it could tell you that it's not just about having the best players, it's about having the best team, and sort of making that balance right, and at the weekend it didn't quite look right.",
      "\"I think we will have a title race, and I think there's a lot of talk. I think the great thing about football is what we actually saw on Sunday with Liverpool. It didn't look right.",
      "\"It tells me it's not just about spending lots of money and buying the best players, you've still got to manage that team and make it work and have a nice balance to it.\"",
      "\"If they get Isak, which it looks like he's agitating for a move, then it will make them massive favorites. But Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, I think will push them closer than last year.\"",
      "Former Spurs and Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp also believes Liverpool are on to retain the Premier League title this season, especially if they're able to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, with Manchester United omitted from his predictions.",
      "He told BetVictor Casino : \"I'd have to fancy Liverpool again. They're looking strong, have made some good signings and are still obviously trying to get Alexander Isak in.",
      "\"If they get him, that would be icing on the cake probably for them. I've just got a feeling they could go on a run for a couple of years like we had with Manchester City dominating.\"",
      "\"Arsenal and Man City, they're the two big dangers,\" Redknapp added. \"I think everyone's expecting Chelsea. They're going to do it, they'll be close. But I think Arsenal and Man City, I see them as bigger dangers than Chelsea to Liverpool.",
      "“I think that will be the top four basically in whatever route, I think Liverpool top. After that, it will be second and third for either Arsenal or Man City. And I think Chelsea will probably finish fourth again.”",
      "Also on The Overlap - Stick to Football podcast, Neville probed Arsenal legend Ian Wright on whether Arteta's squad could finally clinch their first championship since 2004.",
      "Initially, he highlighted the three issues that Arsenal seem to have addressed, with the north London side now boasting a fit squad and having secured Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and prolific striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "Neville, speaking to Wright, said: \"Last season, three problems - injuries to [Bukayo] Saka and [Kai] Havertz obviously caused big problems, obviously you have to keep players fit.",
      "\"You had a problem in midfield and you've got Zubimendi come in and you had a problem up top, with presence really, and Gyokeres has come in. Does that give them the 'difference' to win the League?\".",
      "Wright replied: \"I hope so. I think so, because we've added to a team that's finished second three times now and we've added goals to it.",
      "\"You know, Zubimendi, especially with that mid-block [in the opposition] we can't break, Zubimendi the way he plays, I'm watching him break through [the mid-block]. You've got Gyokeres who can score a goal. You look at the fact that [Arsenal] were 17 goals behind Liverpool [last season] but defensively we're brilliant.",
      "\"So if we can sort that out, and this mid-block [problem] then yeah, I'm going to go for Arsenal again, of course I am, because absolutely, why wouldn't I?\".",
      "He further commented: \"What's good about us as well is the [contract] renewals. Saka, in good form now, he's probably going to renew. Gabriel, Ethan [Nwaneri], and for [Arsenal sporting director, Andrea] Berta to come in, and he's unbelievable when you meet him, Berta's done the deals, he's got it done.\"",
      "Despite his doubts, Keane supported Wright's evaluation, suggesting that Arsenal have genuinely addressed their issues, stating: \"Yeah, I'm going with Arsenal,\" while warning that Liverpool's ability to score under pressure could be a deciding factor.",
      "\"The only thing, and I'll go back to Liverpool, and Liverpool on a bad day, when they're off they can score three goals,\" Keane added. \"Even in the [Community] Shield at the weekend, [where they lost to Crystal Palace on penalties] they still scored two goals. And if you're scoring two goals on average every game, then that's hard to stop.\"",
      "However, Wright, undeterred, reiterated: \"We finished second three times, why would I go someone else?\"",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Micah Richards revisited last year's predictions before giving his take on this season, saying: \"It's a hard one because I remember saying last season that I thought Manchester City had won it if everyone stayed fit. If [City] got any injuries, those little injuries could be the difference.",
      "\"Bringing in Gyokeres now for Arsenal is massive. And not just because he's a big-name forward. Because of his movement that we talk about with strikers all the time. Havertz is really good, we're all big fans of Havertz, but in a number 10 position where he can create, not leading the line.",
      "\"I know [Havertz has] done really good movement when he plays up there but he hasn't got a striker's instinct. So that's why I think Gyokeres is gonna add something really special.",
      "\"I still don't know if it's enough to get them [Arsenal] over the line. I still don't know. I think one or two injuries and they're back to the same as last season. So I'm going to say challenging but not champions.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer was in agreement with his podcast co-pundit, telling the Rest is Football podcast Arsenal will just miss out again this season. He said: \"I think they’ll challenge, I just think they may fall short again.",
      "“I like all of their signings. I think that’s exactly what they needed. And I still don’t think they may be finished yet in terms of bringing players in and certainly players going out.",
      "“I’ve definitely got them in Champions League but I just don’t see them having enough to win the title. Just fall short.”",
      "Gary Lineker also followed suit, stating: \"I think I concur with both of you on that front. I probably wouldn’t have said that if it wasn’t that Liverpool have strengthened so well. A lot too will depend on how Gyokeres does. I mean he scored a terrific goal in pre-season but we all know pre-season is not that important.",
      "\"Although, it is for a striker in terms of that feeling of hitting the back of the net. So I think a lot will depend on him but we know he’ll get good service. I think they could go close again but I’m going to agree.\"",
      "Former Man City defender Joleon Lescott believes Pep Guardiola's side will bounce back this season and win the title. Speaking at the launch of the new Topps Premier League 2025-26 trading card collection, he said: \"Regardless of how last season panned out, they are definitely going to be one of the favourites. It's Pep Guardiola, it's Man City with some of the world's best players\", reports the Mirror.",
      "\"It would be foolish to not see them as favorites in every competition they enter. That doesn't mean they're going to win everything, but they're definitely one of the favorites.\"",
      "City finished last season 13 points behind Arne Slot's Reds but Lescott felt there was a pretty clear reason behind it.",
      "\"It was obviously an unprecedented season for them last year, but they've achieved something no one in the history of English football has achieved so it's always going to take its toll,\" he explained.",
      "\"It did that last year. Not only a physical toll, but a mental toll to stay focussed for that long and to have to win games for that period of time. When they recognised that they weren't going to win the title, whether it was subconsciously or not, they were able to switch off a little bit.",
      "\"Physically the demand was still there but hopefully they've had a break mentally, not to have to go out there and concentrate points wise, hopefully that now means they'll come back ready to go.\"",

      "Manchester United are back in Premier League action this weekend when they kick off their season at home against Arsenal on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm kick-off).",
      "That match could see three players make their competitive debuts for the club. Over the summer so far, United have completed the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and striker Benjamin Sesko, while 18-year-old Diego Leon also arrived after a deal to sign him was struck in January.",
      "But there could also potentially be some United players making their debuts away from Old Trafford over the weekend. The club have both midfielder Daniel Gore and Ethan Wheatley out on loan to EFL (English Football League) clubs with both having played for their new clubs over the past two weekends.",
      "But it seems that two other youngsters are now closing in on temporary moves away from Old Trafford. Midfielder Toby Collyer is closing in on a loan move to West Bromwich Albion with the Baggies beating off plenty of Championship interest in the 21-year-old.",
      "Left-back Harry Amass looks likely to join crisis club Sheffield Wednesday on loan to build up more first team experience over the season. The Owls are now able to sign loan players and free transfers after having a transfer embargo lifted.",
      "Both teams are in Championship action this weekend, but face a race against time if they wish for the United youngsters to make their debuts. Players have to be signed before 12pm on Friday to be able to feature this weekend.",
      "If the loan deals are completed in time, then Collyer could make his West Brom debut on Saturday when they take on Wrexham away (12.30pm kick-off). Amass, meanwhile, would have a home game as Sheffield Wednesday take on Stoke City at Hillsborough at 3pm.",

      "Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho has now agreed terms with Chelsea, it has been reported.",
      "Garnacho, 21, was subject to a £60million bid from Napoli in January, but United decided to keep hold of him and, instead, allowed Marcus Rashford and Antony to join Jadon Sancho out on loan from Old Trafford.",
      "While the Argentina international impressed in patches, Ruben Amorim left him out of the starting XI for the Europa League final against Tottenham in May, prompting a furious reaction from the player.",
      "He has since informed United of his desire to explore different opportunities this summer. Chelsea have held a long-term interest in Garnacho and the Blues are moving closer to getting their man.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport, Chelsea have agreed personal terms with Garnacho. The ex-Atletico Madrid youth product is 'waiting' for a move to Stamford Bridge, as club-to-club talks are advanced.",
      "United want £50m for Garnacho, as they are of the opinion that he should not be sold for much less than the £52m Chelsea got for Noni Madueke, who made the move to Arsenal last month.",
      "However, Chelsea are aware that United need to sell players, especially if they want to pull off a record-breaking deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Garnacho represents pure profit on United's books and Chelsea are hoping to agree a fee south of £40m, having already spent in excess of £240m on no less than ten players, including Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato.",
      "Garnacho scored 11 goals and added 10 assists in 58 matches for the Reds last season and was one of their best players in Europe. Speaking about his future, following a lack of game-time in the Europa League final, Garnacho said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and then see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United head coach Amorim provided an update on Garnacho's future during the club's pre-season tour in the United States earlier this month. \"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said. \"And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Having landed two major commercial partnerships in the past week, the anticipation is that a third will be on the way imminently for Manchester United. Both Coca-Cola and Sokin have come on board in recent days.",
      "On Wednesday, United announced that global drinks giant Coca-Cola would become the club's official carbonated soft drinks partner in the UK and Europe in a multi-year deal which has been reported to be worth around £1million to United.",
      "Then on Thursday came another announcement from the Old Trafford club that they had secured another multi-year partnership with fintech firm Sokin - who will become the club's official global business payments solutions partner in another boost to United's commercial portfolio.",
      "The decline in competitive success over recent years has been impactful when it comes to United's commercial success. While the club is still seen as a global blue-chip brand where partnerships bring exposure, the rate of growth when it comes to commercial activity has not been at the rate of their 'big six' rivals, with United seeing a 10 per cent growth since 2019 up to 2023/2024.",
      "That compares to Arsenal (97 per cent), Tottenham Hotspur (89 per cent), Liverpool (64 per cent), Manchester City (62 per cent) and Chelsea (25 per cent). Across that period, United have been surpassed by both City and Liverpool when it comes to annual commercial revenue.",
      "They do have some major sponsorship inventory still to sell, with the naming rights to their revamped Carrington training complex that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe toured this week on the block, as well as the training kit provider.",
      "The club's previous deal with blockchain firm Tezos came to an end this summer and, for recently installed chief business officer Marc Armstrong, hired from French club Paris Saint-Germain earlier this year, finding partners for these opportunities was key.",
      "The Tezos deal was worth around £24million per-year to United, while naming rights for the training ground likely to fetch some £20million per season plus, with Arsenal's deal struck with Sobha Realty last year worth £15million a year on a four-year agreement.",
      "Ratcliffe, when speaking at the opening of the revamped training complex this week, said of United as a brand: \"This is one of the most recognised brands in the world. It stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.\"",
      "With that in mind, United will see both pieces of sponsorship inventory as key to them driving revenues forward to enable them to stay within the confines of PSR, and be able to reinvest in the squad at a time when they are facing a period away from the Champions League and its riches for another season.",
      "Not underselling the value of such inventory won't be lost on United's commercial department, and the hiring of Armstrong was designed to ensure that the Old Trafford club had the best operators to navigate the partnerships space at a time where they were struggling competitively, but also still had the leverage of being one of the most globally recognised brands in world sport.",
      "The challenge for Armstrong and his team will be to wrestle back the commercial initiative from neighbours City and Liverpool, but a chunk of that will depend on whether or not head coach Ruben Amorim can deliver success on the pitch.",
      "But commercial revenues should get a healthy bump soon, with both the training ground and training kit likely to see valuable partnerships struck up very soon.",

      "Hull are hopeful of wrapping up a deal for Collyer, but they face stiff competition from other teams in the second tier and no final decision has been communicated from the midfielder.",
      "Collyer has attracted intense Championship interest after breaking into the first-team at Old Trafford last season. The 21-year-old made his Premier League debut against Liverpool in September and made 13 senior appearances in total.",

      "\"When I leave it's going to be ‘no hard feelings’. You’re not going to have any negative comments from me about Manchester United. That’s me as a person,\" those were the words of Marcus Rashford to journalist Henry Winter back in December after he first admitted his desire to leave the club.",
      "It was a noble stance to take considering he had just been left out, unceremoniously, from the squad that defeated Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. In the weeks that followed, Rashford would only make the bench at United once more for the loss to Newcastle before being shipped out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Before that transfer, the situation became even frostier between Rashford and Ruben Amorim. In a press conference after beating Fulham, the Portuguese head coach insisted that he would rather have goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital (now 64), on the bench before a player that did not have the right attitude.",
      "It was later clarified that Amorim was making a general point and not one about a specific player, however the remark was made after a question on Rashford. It was clear then that the dynamic between the winger and United had shifted.",
      "In the West Midlands, Rashford kept a low profile. He was protected from most media obligations and did not pass comment on United. However, that all changed this week when he conducted an interview with The Rest is Football following his loan switch to Barcelona.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He described the club as being 'reactionary' and the club have been in 'no man's land' due to the amount of transition and change since Sir Alex Ferguson left. He could have been more damning on the state that United have been in, but it is nevertheless clear the forward has changed his mind on keeping his true feelings suppressed.",
      "\"Show me a successful team that just adapts,\" Rashford said. \"When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team – the whole academy set up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?",
      "\"You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time – they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been… we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident.",
      "\"This is what some people forget. So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.\"",
      "The timing of this change speaks volumes. Perhaps now he is certain to not have a future at United, Rashford feels more empowered to speak his mind.",
      "He could also feel that Amorim's behaviour towards him following the Winter interview has shifted the goalposts. But, there is more than one side to every argument.",
      "Rashford is not completely faultless for the demise of his United career or, in fact, the club as a whole. He is also not solely responsible for either scenario either.",
      "However, what is clear is that Rashford has taken a shift away from keeping quiet and is voicing his opinion on United - and that suggests the relationship with the club has now undergone a complete, and permanent, U-turn.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window spending has been a lot more lucrative than some expected to be the case back in May.",
      "Despite missing out on Champions League football, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have both been bought for substantial fees, while Matheus Cunha arrived during the previous financial period. Despite spending so big so far, United do not seem to be done yet.",
      "Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba is widely reported to be on the club's radar. It has been claimed this week that United players have spoken to the 21-year-old about the club's structure, while representatives have been speaking regarding the finances involved with the deal.",
      "The Seagulls are keen not to sell Baleba, and are eager to hold out for £100million or more, when they eventually do decide to move him on. There are no guarantees that Brighton will receive that money from United or anyone else, but those are the figures the Old Trafford giants are working with.",
      "After Sesko, the consensus was that United would be looking to make sales, and that remains the case. Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all either want to leave or are expected to go this season.",
      "In England, the summer transfer window closes on Monday, September 1 which is - perhaps - not a great deal of time to get all these deals done. While there's confidence that Hojlund will move to AC Milan before then and Garnacho shall hope he's at Chelsea by the time the window slams shut, it still leaves lingering concerns about the remaining trio.",
      "However, plans to sell before signing Baleba are perhaps not as urgent as they at first seem. For starters, United have until June 30, 2026 to balance up the books in line with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "This gives them not one, but two windows to get the unwanted players out. Plus, there is not just the next few weeks remaining for United to sell players. The Saudi and Turkish transfer windows close on September 10 and 11 respectively. While United can't sign players from those regions, they can sell to that market.",
      "For the likes of Antony and Sancho - who have been linked with clubs in both countries - those particular leagues could become a lot more tempting after September 1. The fact of the matter is, this is also a World Cup year and if there is a choice between being frozen out at United until January or going somewhere to play football, then most self-respecting players will choose the latter option.",
      "As mentioned, if needed, United could try again to sell players in January or, in a worst-case scenario, they could sell at the end of the Premier League season prior to the start of the 2026 World Cup and June 30 deadline. At this stage, there won't be much panic from United in terms of their unwanted players remaining on the books prior to striking a Baleba deal, but an eye shall firmly be on the deadline next year to get their accounts in order.",

      "Manchester United are set to play Grimsby in the second round of this season's the Carabao Cup following the draw on Wednesday night.",
      "The last time they featured in round two of the competition was during the 2014/15 season, after finishing seventh in the league the previous campaign and missing out on European qualification. On that occasion, United faced MK Dons away, and were comfortably beaten 4-0 on the night.",
      "The competition was known as the Capital One Cup at the time and the result marked a dismal start to life under Louis van Gaal, who had been appointed earlier that summer to replace David Moyes. United were beginning what would prove to be a difficult period for the club as they tried to fill the void left by Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "This time, Ruben Amorim is overseeing things and he will be expecting a sharp increase in fortunes from last season's disappointing 15th place finish in the Premier League. The club were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the quarter-finals, falling to a 4-3 defeat to their eventual Europa League final conquerers Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United are entering the competition at this early stage due to their poor Premier League campaign, with only Wolves and Tottenham separating them from the relegation places.",
      "It means Amorim faces a huge task to change the club's fortunes, and he will be hoping to avoid a similar embarrassment to the one Van Gaal endured 11 years ago.",
      "Since their last appearance in the second round of the Carabao Cup, United have lifted the trophy twice. First in 2017 under Jose Mourinho, beating Southampton 3-2, and again in 2023 during Erik ten Hag’s first season in charge, with a 2-0 win over Newcastle United at Wembley Stadium.",

      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, plenty more transfer activity is expected at Manchester United.",
      "They still need to try and offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony, a handful of youngsters in need of loan moves and bring in a midfielder. The prospect of a goalkeeper also being drafted in is still possible.",
      "After experiencing their worst season in 51 years last term, United have had little choice but to splash the cash this summer. They have rightfully prioritised attacking signings, bringing in three new faces in the hope of increasing their attacking output.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves and bringing in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford prior to the season tour of the United States, United completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last weekend, bringing an end to their search for a striker.",
      "After recording a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League last season, United had to make the addition of a proven goalscorer their priority this summer. Sesko has arrived on the back of a 21-goal season for Leipzig last term.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "As a result of Sesko's arrival at Old Trafford, Rasmus Hojlund is looking increasingly likely to depart ahead of the window closing on September 1. It is understood he is open to joining AC Milan, who are in the process of rebuilding their squad under head coach Massimiliano Allegri.",
      "Hojlund started just two of United's five pre-season friendlies and watched attacking-midfielders Cunha and Mason Mount lead the line in his absence against Everton and Fiorentina. That was almost certainly Ruben Amorim's way of telling him he doesn't feature in his plans.",
      "Amid the increasing likelihood of Hojlund departing, United have been credited with interest in former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is still a free agent after leaving the Toffees at the end of last season. It was reported by talkSPORT on Monday that United are one of three Premier League clubs he has 'held talks' with him.",
      "Reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford have baffled former United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "\"Calvert-Lewin can't stay fit,\" said the former United centre-back on his YouTube channel. \"No. Why would we bring him in to this club?",
      "\"This club is built on the academy and we've got Chido Obi sitting there. Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who's older and can't stay fit.\"",
      "Not only is Ferdinand right that United should steer clear of Calvert-Lewin, who scored just three Premier League goals last season, but he is also right that the club should prioritise the development of Chido Obi.",
      "Of course, the Danish youth international is only 17 and is still learning his trade, but he has an enormous amount of potential United should be trying to unleash instead of signing a 28-year-old that has scored just 17 Premier League goals in the last four seasons.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has only made it into double figures twice in the Premier League in his career, last doing so in 2020/21, scoring 16 goals under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Sesko will be their main man at the tip United's attack this season and Obi will be hungry to be the support act, providing competition and help from the bench. He made eight appearances last season and will only get better the more game time he earns.",
      "United's history is built on promoting from within and their academy has been a consistent beacon of light throughout the recent struggles at first-team level. Obi has demonstrated he is an instinctive striker, possessing traits that cannot always be taught on the training ground.",
      "United supporters love nothing more than seeing an academy graduate make their mark in the first-team and there is every chance Obi will be able to do that in good time.",
      "Additionally, with no European football to come this season, United do not have as many fixtures to look forward to, meaning rotation will not be as heavy as in previous seasons. That could allow Obi to be eased in slower, helping him and United in the process.",
      "Obi is a much more appealing option than Calvert-Lewin as a secondary striker right now.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The cash-strapped Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already spent £200m on a whole new front three for Ruben Amorim and is currently searching sofa crevices for an extra wad in order to sign him a new goalkeeper and central midfielder.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma makes an awful lot of sense to replace Andre Onana as No.1 and won’t cost the world, but while we can absolutely see why Amorim has pinpointed Carlos Baleba as his ‘perfect’ midfielder, reports suggest the Red Devils aren’t able to drum up the £100m-plus required to sign him from Brighton this summer.",
      "They absolutely need a midfielder in a similar mould though, and as luck would have it, the great guys at FBRef have a very nifty list of 10 players from across Europe’s top five leagues who have similar characteristics to Baleba. Namely being an aggressive, tough-tackling midfielder who can go past opponents with the ball at his feet.",
      "",
      "Abdoulaye Toure (Le Havre, £2.5m)\nTen Ligue 1 goals from midfield for Le Havre last season sounds very promising indeed but a 15th-place finish having conceded 71 goals does raise the question as to how good Toure was at his primary job of protecting the defence.",
      "And there’s a suspicion of him taking a ‘f*** it, I’m going to enjoy myself’ approach to football at the age of 31 given his 11 previous seasons of senior football have yielded 17 goals in total.",
      "",
      "Felix Nmecha (Borussia Dortmund, £24m)\nOne that got away from Manchester City, not in the sense that he would ever have played for them, but because he left them on a free transfer in 2021, two years before being sold by Wolfsburg to Borussia Dortmund for £26m.",
      "United have been linked with the 24-year-old, but David Ornstein claimed ‘interest’ hasn’t turned into anything more concrete.",
      "",
      "Amadou Onana (Aston Villa, £43m)\nSigned for £50m from Everton last summer, Onana had a largely forgettable first season at Villa Park, partly down to a couple of injuries but also because of Unai Emery’s typical preference for Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara at the base of midfield.",
      "That’s a tricky partnership to break in fairness to Onana, who would undoubtedly improve United’s midfield but his transfer may also feel a tad underwhelming, as often appears to be the case when he plays.",
      "",
      "Jean-Eudus Aholou (free agent)\nUnconfirmed reports suggest Qatari side Umm Salal SC have already swooped in ahead of United to sign the 31-year-old journeyman, who represented seven Ligue 1 clubs before ‘amicably terminating his contract’ with Angers this summer.",
      "",
      "Mario Martin (Real Madrid, £1.3m)\nAfter 20 La Liga games for Real Valladolid last season the 21-year-old’s off to Getafe on loan this term. We wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Manchester United making a £50m-plus move for the graduate of the Real Madrid academy in 2027, because why sign burgeoning talent on the cheap when you can pay big bucks for them after developing elsewhere?",
      "",
      "Johnny Cardoso (Atletico Madrid, £22m)\nLinked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the window as part of a possible Antony haggle, to the extent that there are several ‘Welcome to Manchester United’ videos on YouTube of the USMNT international, who instead swapped Real Betis for Atletico, which is in itself enough to suggest he would be the right sort of player to aid United. Diego Simeone loves a midfield pr*ck.",
      "",
      "Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham, £26m)\nHe was excellent against Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup and we love watching an on-song Bentancur, but he’s arguably the most Tottenham of all the Tottenham players, somehow managing to have the mercuriality of a 20-year-old winger as a 28-year-old defensive midfielder. We have every confidence that a move to Old Trafford would swallow him whole.",
      "",
      "Anton Stach (Leeds, £12m)\nAs much as we would enjoy the volume of boiled piss leaching into the rivers of West Yorkshire as a result of a player Leeds signed this summer moving immediately to Manchester United, it’s unfortunately unlikely to happen.",
      "",
      "Dario Essugo (Chelsea, £17m)\nWe have a sneaky feeling Chelsea may have another very, very good midfield destroyer on their hands in Essugo, who’s only just arrived from Sporting but will need at least one significant injury to play anything more than a bit-part role under Enzo Maresca this season, with Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Andrey Santos all very much above him in the pecking order. A loan move would be a smart option, but that’s not going to be to United.",
      "",
      "Seydouba Cisse (Leganes, £2.6m)\nRelegated with Leganes last season and a lack of interest in his services from sides remaining in the top tier suggests Cisse is not the big fix Amorim needs as the base of his midfield.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are in front of neighbours Man City in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton this summer, according to reports.\nThe Red Devils are looking to continue…",
      "Manchester United have made a decision on Carlos Baleba as Brighton ‘have to listen to offers’ for the midfielder, who will be their ‘next major sale’.",

      "Man Utd could free up an extra £75m in order to seal a record-breaking transfer for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, according to reports.",

Player welfare, player shmelfare, and while our football itch has been scratched by that delightful bleeding of one season into the next, so too has our great desire to see big football clubs spend the GDP of small countries on new players in a transfer window featuring several middle fingers to the PSR overlords.",

The only thing conceivably better than both being absolute horses*t would be for Rasmus Hojlund and Kai Havertz to start ahead of them.",

      "Team to watch: Chelsea\nTipped to win the actual Premier League title by two of our boldest predictors after arguably the best six months of any football club in the world. Champions League qualification was shortly followed by completing the European trophy set before they spanked Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final to secure the whole trophy shebang.",
      "Goalscoring concerns have been eased and then some through the signings of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap, while further forwards who may or may not be brilliant have been bought to replace those who may or may not have been brilliant and turned out to be the latter.",
      "There are still doubts in these parts over Enzo Maresca’s style of football but no-one will care as long as they’re winning, and we suspect they may do that rather a lot, starting with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on Sunday before a very soft start to the season then sees them face West Ham (A), Fulham (H) and Brentford (A).",
      "With their first game against a team that finished in the top seven last term not until October when they face Liverpool, Chelsea could really build up a head of steam.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Eddie Howe\nEddie Howe should have been floating on air this summer having been the first Newcastle manager to win a major trophy in 56 years before leading them back into the Champions League last season.",
      "Instead he’s had seemingly endless transfer false dawns and disappointments, presumably bearing the brunt and stress of all of that with no sitting sporting director to shield him from it, while a moping £150m striker decides he doesn’t want to play for a club or manager that’s had a major hand in turning him into that £150m striker.",
      "We imagine he’s dreading this season, not least their opener away at Villa Park on Saturday, in which either William Osula or Anthony Gordon will be leading his line. Having long thought Newcastle would at some point have to upgrade Howe in order to take the next step and challenge for the most major of major honours, we’re now left wondering whether they even deserve him.",
      "He’s now the primary reason, perhaps the only reason, we’re not expecting Newcastle to entirely collapse this season.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Florian Wirtz\nA combination of the deal being done early, the Hugo Ekitike hijack and the multifarious Isak bombshells since has rendered Liverpool paying a nine-figure sum for Wirtz – which could turn into a British-record transfer fee after add-ons – somehow insignificant.",
      "That can only be good news for him as he makes his Premier League bow against Bournemouth on Friday night, with Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo, Romelu Lukaku and Antony among those in the top 10 most expensive signings of all time who – at least initially – struggled to cope with the pressure of their price tags.",
      "We don’t see Wirtz as a player who will hide in games or struggle to get involved, and we can’t wait to see how he fits into a Liverpool side who never looked as though they were missing a player of his enviable skill in a playmaker role as they stormed to the title last season.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Wrexham v West Brom\nThe Championship newbies conceded 90th and 96th-minute goals to lose 2-1 to Southampton at St Mary’s on the opening day and have a second chance to bloody the nose of another side well-accustomed to the Premier League in West Brom on Saturday. We can almost smell the dozen or so long reads on a first Championship game at a bouncing SToK Racecourse while the travelling Baggies boing in the away stand.",

      "European game to watch: Mallorca v Barcelona\nThe jeopardy for Marcus Rashford ahead of the first La Liga game of the season isn’t based on whether Hansi Flick will be manoeuvring his team around to hand him a starting spot on the left, but whether Barcelona will actually be able to register him as a Barcelona player in time. They insist that they will, and even if they don’t, this Barcelona is always worth a watch.",

      "Liverpool are set to sign one of their centre-back targets imminently, but another will probably have to wait a year. Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest are moving mad…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. It comes down to this: Brighton value Baleba at £100million. Man Utd do not. Are Brighton likely to come down? No. No they are not.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed.",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "",
      "17) Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick are wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Around £67million might persuade Pep to part with the Brazilian. But Spurs’ reported bid didn’t quite meet that.",
      "",
      "16) 🔼 Kevin – Shakhtar Donetsk to Fulham\nFulham face the prospect of losing Rodrigo Muniz to Atalanta but the £30million-plus they receive from the Italians looks likely to be shifted straight to Shakhtar’s account in a deal which could break the Cottager’s record spend. It’s about time Fulham got around to doing something.",
      "",
      "15) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "14) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "MORE ON EZE: Four real and compelling reasons why Eberechi Eze might choose Spurs over Arsenal",
      "",
      "13) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have made a breakthrough with one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs are close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "10) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days and Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho, but a move to Roma is now looking likely. The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Omari Hutchinson – Ipswich to Nottingham Forest\nA club-record £37.5m deal is close to being agreed. It’s not fully agreed, but it’s looking good.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Nottingham Forest\nBlimey. Forest are moving mad now that their Europa League spot has been confirmed. £26m for Kalimuendo is good business. £37.5m for Hutchinson is…interesting business.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nAnd it looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. Reports say a deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons has been agreed and Ramsey is heading for a medical on Thursday evening.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Giovanni Leoni – Parma to Liverpool\nLiverpool want Leoni in addition to Guehi and it seems they have got him. Apparently, a deal has been agreed worth £26million plus add-ons. So the 18-year-old has flown in and should be a Liverpool player by the weekend."

      "Eddie Howe is pretty high in the betting, with only five Premier League managers deemed less safe.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might if a new-look City make a stumbling start and he decides to sod it all for a game of soldiers.",
      "",
      "13=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "13=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "13=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "13=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "9) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nAnother really interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four points adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we’ve said elsewhere, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "5) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "2=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "1) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",

      "Trying to recall what happened between them last season is difficult but Pizzagate, Ruud van Nistelrooy versus Martin Keown, Roy Keane protecting Gary Neville from Patrick Vieira in the tunnel and Alex Ferguson pronouncing ‘Japan’ weirdly are all firmly embedded in the psyche and form a routine part of the pre-game build-up when the Gunners face the Red Devils.",
      "As a spectacle, the only hope of salvaging something meaningful from Arsenal v Manchester United is to feed into the contemporary phenomenon of manufacturing rivalries between players. And Viktor Gyokeres versus Benjamin Sesko has been ripening all summer long for that particular picking.",
      "The dream scenario of Gyokeres flopping for Arsenal while Sesko single-footedly drags Manchester United towards competence remains live, but really the alternative timeline in which Gyokeres delivers the title and Sesko proves to be a hilariously expensive gamble gone wrong is every bit as fun and enticing.",
      "It certainly feels a more even battle than the Erling Haaland v Darwin Nunez feud built entirely out of laborious comparisons between two pricey centre-forwards who happened to be signed at the same time by clubs with substantial fanbases.",
      "At least here there is enough evidence to suggest Arsenal and Manchester United would both have been happy settling for the other striker. And their opening weekend clash gets the ball rolling on unavoidable proceedings immediately.",
      "",
      "9) Leeds v Sunderland – The Summer Spend derby\nWhile sacking Peter Reid and flirting with financial implosion was the strongest common denominator between Leeds and Sunderland prior to this summer, promotion has pulled them closer together despite being remarkably far apart in their approach to Premier League preparation.",
      "Leeds have recruited sensibly if slowly, focusing on defensive additions to solidify their spine and avoid having to make another panicked May phone call to Sam Allardyce.",
      "Fees have been spent on a goalkeeper, two centre-halves, a left-back and two more defensive-minded midfielders. The free agent Lukas Nmecha has been their only attacking signing after a move for Igor Paixao proved too difficult.",
      "Sunderland have taken a slightly different view, albeit out of necessity due to a less prepared squad and to offset sales. Only seven clubs in the entire world have spent more than the Black Cats this summer, with Habib Diarra becoming their record signing.",
      "Trying to achieve the impossible feat of surviving in the Premier League as a promoted club already pitted Leeds and Sunderland against each other; that dichotomy in perceived ambition has stoked the flames for some.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea v Liverpool – The Tribunal To Determine Compensation derby\nAmong the many words used were ‘seething’ and ‘furious’ when Chelsea had what they felt was ‘a generational talent’ snatched from under their noses in summer 2024.",
      "Their habitual hoarding of ludicrously prodigious teenaged wide forwards at least compensates the selling club fairly; the final amount Liverpool will pay for Ngumoha is unknown but his pre-season performances suggest it won’t be commensurate to his ability and potential.",
      "The results of a tribunal to determine the compensation owed to Chelsea have not been disclosed but previous such hearings have only returned pay-outs of up to £10m, a valuation Ngumoha might well far exceed by the end of a season in which he only turns 17.",
      "A clear first-team pathway at Liverpool was crucial in the forward’s decision to move to Anfield and Arne Slot has already outlined the role Ngumoha can play across four competitions of a gruelling season.",
      "Chelsea will be keeping a keen eye, although arguably should have done so far sooner.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa v Manchester United – The Selection Methodology derby, ft. Emi Martinez and maybe Ollie Watkins\n“Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "“With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.”",
      "It was a wonderfully impotent announcement issued by an Aston Villa side who, by their own account, “acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such”.",
      "The PGMOL response never was revealed but could well have amounted to Howard Webb pointing out they should probably just have beaten a Manchester United side which had already lost 22 games last season by then, regardless of the referee chosen.",
      "Unai Emery hinted that Thomas Bramall had apologised for his “huge mistake” but the consequences of Villa failing to leave Old Trafford with the single point they needed for Champions League qualification are still being felt.",
      "Evann Guessand of Nice has been their only significant first-team signing and there has been a clear reluctance to make the same player PSR sacrifices which defined their summer of 2024.",
      "Emi Martinez was one of those made available for transfer but Manchester United rubbed salt in that wound by only asking for him on loan.",
      "",
      "6) Brentford v Newcastle – The Broken Promises derby\nAn alternative name pitch might be The Hypocrisy derby, so wonderfully has Newcastle’s entire transfer window captured the perennial insincerity at the very heart of football fandom.",
      "Alexander Isak is a treacherous, villainous turncoat who has betrayed Newcastle, been misadvised and refused to train, play or join the club on tour after having his head turned and ear burned by supposed broken promises about being allowed to go.",
      "Yoane Wissa just wants to leave Brentford and is being held against his will.",
      "These contortions and contradictions are a necessary part of supporting a club but a Brentford side already pillaged by richer and bigger teams must have enjoyed any and all attempts to paint Newcastle as an innocent victim of the hierarchy this summer.",
      "",
      "5) Newcastle v Manchester United – The Transfer Food Chain derby\nThe Magpies have, however, been reminded of their place in that food chain to an uproariously chastening degree.",
      "Their best version in a generation, arguably ever, has been routinely upstaged by the worst modern iteration of Manchester United by an absurd margin.",
      "Champions League qualification and a trophy has been outweighed by the very fact Old Trafford is crumbling and players would prefer to be part of rebuilding it rather than having to call Jason Tindall ‘Bossman’.",
      "The semantics on Matheus Cunha can and have been debated but Newcastle were absolutely interested in Bryan Mbeumo before the player removed himself from their equation after Ruben Amorim’s admiring glances, while the moves were put on Benjamin Sesko before his public rejection of the Eddie Howe project.",
      "Newcastle still and will always have a win in the Alan Shearer battle of 1996, but their war over signings with Manchester United incurred some really quite embarrassing casualties in 2025.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United v Brentford – The Refuse To Be Held For Ransom derby\nThe most high-profile of these disputes this summer have largely involved the same set of clubs cast in different roles: Newcastle as both victim and aggressor; Nottingham Forest as predator and prey.",
      "Manchester United trying to pretend they were fighting the good fight against Brentford was a curious development but Sir Jim Ratcliffe has to get his kicks somewhere and if it doesn’t involve people losing jobs we should take it.",
      "There were 44 days between Manchester United bidding £45m plus £10m in add-ons for Mbeumo and agreeing a deal at £65m plus £6m in add-ons.",
      "The intervening weeks were filled with intermittent noise including a claim the buying club would not be held to ‘ransom’, which they eventually and inevitably were.",
      "But even upon the conclusion of the deal, Manchester United were not done. They leaked their fury with Brentford to the usual cabal of journalists after it emerged that the Bees shamefully tried to secure the best possible deal they could for their most valuable player.",
      "Good on little Manchester United for sticking it to big bad Brentford.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle v Liverpool – The £150m Valuation derby\nWhen the signing of a potential £79m forward is only ever presented as a secondary plot point to the wider overall narrative, you know a lot of water has gathered under the bridge connecting Newcastle and Liverpool.",
      "A wise sage once referred to their rivalry as ‘toxic’ because of 1) some results, 2) Newcastle once poaching an analyst from Liverpool, 3) Liverpool being one of many clubs to oppose their takeover, and 4) Liverpool having spent some money more than four decades ago, but this summer did mark a definitive turn in their relationship.",
      "The Ekitike hijack could be forgiven by a club who have known nothing different in this transfer window. A target choosing to join someone else is part and parcel of the game, and losing a race to the Premier League champions who will be among the Champions League favourites can be brushed off quickly.",
      "But the Isak saga has cast an uncomfortable cloud over Newcastle’s summer and left a sour taste. Even when handed all the cards of a three-year contract with no release clause and no need to make a book-balancing sale, the Magpies have looked thoroughly unconvincing with their hard-line stance.",
      "They did land one shot with the loaded claim that Liverpool had ‘bottled’ their first and as yet only actual bid for Isak but there is a clear sense that even if he stays, the damage has been done.",
      "The best-case scenario for Newcastle is that they will be without their best player for the first couple of games of the season, and perhaps on a mental level well beyond that, before he recovers something close to the form which has made him so desirable.",
      "But bridges between player and club can be mended if not fixed completely; any club-to-club camaraderie has been torched.",
      "",
      "2) Nottingham Forest v Spurs – The Release Clause derby\nIt seems like an age since the capture of Mohammed Kudus was followed up with the stunning revelation that Spurs would be signing Morgan Gibbs-White the next day.",
      "More than a month has passed and not only have Spurs not invested that £60m elsewhere, they have also lost to a probable season-long injury the sort of player Gibbs-White would have shared the creative burden with.",
      "Daniel Levy still struggles to understand Spurs fans and was given a public crash course in Evangelos Marinakis this summer too. But the Spurs chairman has played the role of 2013 Arsenal impeccably, understandably but clearly mistakenly believing that triggering a release clause in the contract of a player keen to join would indeed be enough to procure them.",
      "One legal threat, renewed deal and announcement with the air of a hostage video later, all with Marinakis front and centre, Spurs were left wondering what had just happened while Forest merrily went about their business.",
      "Then it emerged that Marinakis felt ‘it would have been a backward step’ for Gibbs-White to leave the City Ground for Spurs and suddenly sacking Nuno or waiting to poach Brennan Johnson felt remarkably tame.",
      "",
      "1) Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest – The Blind Trust derby\nA trick has been missed. There is a chance to rectify it, even if that would require some manoeuvring and would impact a few different clubs. But it must be done.",
      "One of the games between Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest, currently scheduled for late August and January, must be moved to March 1. The narrative must be fed.",
      "It shouldn’t be that match at Selhurst Park on the season’s second weekend; that promises to be biblical. Palace’s first home game, their demotion from the Europa League for Forest to benefit still fresh, perhaps with the FA Cup and Community Shield paraded beforehand, played in between a pair of Conference League play-off qualifier legs, will have a glorious edge to it.",
      "Steve Parish certainly won’t be rushing to offer out any executive boxes.",
      "If Forest supporters aren’t already arranging chants of “decisive influence” to the ‘is there a fire drill?’ tune, or scribbling ‘Rules Are Rules’ on a crude Photoshop of Marinakis and John Textor shaking hands, then they too should have their Europa spot revoked.",
      "And if the losing team doesn’t take the result to the Court of Arbitration for Sport it’s worth wondering what we’re all doing here.",
      "According to reports, Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis ‘erupted’ in a second clash with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo at the weekend.",
      "‘Scandalous from that Forest owner,’ said Gary Neville, but both owner and manager have downplayed the dressing-down.",
      "Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has stepped down from his role to avoid future complications if the club qualify for Europe."

      "The Swede is presumably as gutted as anyone that Manchester United look set to beat the Magpies to his possible replacement Benjamin Sesko, and with Liverpool in the baller position of not needing him and therefore refusing to up the ante to pressure Newcastle into his sale, Isak may consider a strike as his only recourse to secure his dream transfer.",

      "",
      "Dimitri Payet\n“I worked hard in every game without taking any pleasure,” Payet said of Slaven Bilic’s dreary football as West Ham boss having downed tools in January 2017. “You could say I was pissed off.”",
      "The exit push came on the back of him winning the Premier League Player of the Year and less than a year after he signed a new five-year deal at The London Stadium worth £125,000 per week. Best not to mention his name in East London.",
      "",
      "Raheem Sterling\nLiverpool had already rejected a couple of Manchester City offers for Sterling in the summer of 2015 before the winger asked not to go on the Reds’ pre-season tour.",
      "He had already snubbed a £100,000 per week extension in his bid to force a move he eventually got when City coughed up the £50m Liverpool wanted. Deemed a helluva lot for the mercurial winger at the time, Pep Guardiola turned Sterling into goalscoring machine to help them to four Premier League titles in five seasons at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "William Gallas\nHow we would have loved to be a fly on the wall when Gallas told Jose Mourinho he would score own goals or make deliberate mistakes if he was selected for Chelsea while trying to force through a move to Arsenal, who were offering him more money in the summer of 2006 than the Premier League champions.",
      "Gallas got we he wanted but so too did Chelsea, who paid just £5m plus the wantaway defender for Ashley Cole.",
      "",
      "Diego Costa\nInarguably the most understandable strike of all given the combination of Antonio Conte telling Costa ‘you are not in my plans’ via text message the summer after his 20 goals helped Chelsea to the 2016/2017 title and the club’s weirdly antithetical not-for-sale stance.",
      "Costa chilled in Brazil for six months while his replacement Alvaro Morata slipped into depression at Stamford Bridge, before making a £57m return to Atletico Madrid in January 2018.",
      "",
      "Riyad Mahrez\nThe Premier League champion went AWOL after Leicester told Manchester City they wanted £95m for the Algerian on deadline day in January 2018.",
      "“You’ll always have regrets but at that time I thought it was the best thing to do,” Mahrez said after missing a couple of games for the Foxes. “I was away because I needed time to think, it was a difficult situation.”",
      "Mahrez missed out on a consecutive title having missed out on the move in January, but went on to win a further four Premier League gongs having moved to City that summer, along with three League Cups, two FA Cups and the Champions League.",
      "",
      "Sebastien Squillaci\n“I knew if I played against Braga then I would not have been able to play for Arsenal in the Champions League,” Squillaci explained when asked why he refused to turn out for Sevilla in August 2010 despite being named in their starting lineup.",
      "The Frenchman ironically made his Champions League bow for the Gunners in their 6-0 win over Braga, who made the group stage courtesy of a 5-3 aggregate win over Sevilla which may not have happened had Squillaci been playing.",

      "Dimitar Berbatov\n“We put him on the map,” said an angry Daniel Levy after Berbatov refused to play against Sunderland or Chelsea at the start of the 2008/2009 season amid interest from Manchester United, with Sir Alex Ferguson branding Levy’s complaints to the Premier League over their supposed tapping up of the Bulgarian as “embarrassing” after the Red Devils secured his £30m transfer.",
      "",
      "Carlos Tevez\nHaving already had one half of Manchester turn against him by moving to City after two years at United, Tevez set about burning all of his bridges in the city when he refused to come off the bench during a Champions League clash at Bayern Munich in September 2011.",
      "The striker was suspended and fined while agent Kia Joorabchian failed to negotiate his transfer to AC Milan, before returning in March to help City to their first Premier League title with four goals and three assists across the last ten games of the season, eventually leaving for Juventus a year later for a cut-price fee of £12m.",

      "Pierre van Hooijdonk\n“I achieved some memorable things in football but in England they always talk about that and that’s a shame,” Van Hooijdonk said when reflecting on his decision to return to the Netherlands rather than play for Nottingham Forest after helping them to the Premier League in 1998.",
      "The striker already had a fractious relationship with Dave Bassett after the Forest boss promised him an exit after securing promotion, but told Newcastle to pay £10m after a £7m bid. “£10m in 1997 was ridiculous,” Van Hooijdonk said. “That’s like trying to sell a cappuccino for £25.” It would be close to £200m in today’s money.",
      "Basset was “disgusted” with the Dutchman, who returned after missing the first 11 games of the season, ahead of a £4.5m move to Vitesse in the summer of 1999.",

      "The most ridiculous definition I’ve heard is that being in the top five in your position makes you world class. By that logic, the fifth-best left-back is world class while the sixth-best striker isn’t, which is utter tosh.",
      "Throwing it around willy-nilly is also a red flag. It’s a sacred term, people. By my reckoning, there are only 16 world-class players in the Premier League.

      "",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal)\nThe last of Arsenal’s three world-class players — though others are close. William Saliba is very, very near that level. Martin Zubimendi could get there if he adapts quickly to English football. Martin Odegaard disappointed last season, and Viktor Gyokeres needs to prove himself in the Premier League, even if he did score 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP.",
      "But this is about Gabriel, who’s been among the best centre-backs in the world over the last three years. He’s better than Saliba, though for some reason doesn’t get the same PR. His set-piece threat is a nice bonus — even if defenders shouldn’t be known for goals.",

The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",

      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves.

You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "9) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",

      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",

      "7) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

But better to wait for a nice one than confirm a sh*t one, as we always say.",
      "Inevitably, the combination of red-and-white stripes plus hummel leads us down a vaguely Southampton route here, but while ‘is it obviously a Team X kit’ is one of our core criteria we are going to cut some slack here because we simply don’t think there’s any way around that particular puzzle without abandoning hummel altogether, and we’re very much in baby-with-the-bathwater territory there.",
      "Lovely simple kit, this, so much so that we don’t even mind the centred badge because everything is at least balanced. Collar is 10/10, the chevrons look as magnificent as ever, and quite simply hummel have done it again, as they nearly always do. Great bunch of lads.",

Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

Spurs’ defence has its own issues for sure, but it’s been almost comically under-protected for years and that should change at least with everyone’s favourite midfield tackler in harness. Feels like he could save Spurs ten goals just by cutting things out at source, but also that he’ll need to given the current (to be confirmed) state of their attacking options.",

      "",
      "10) Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nThis shouldn’t be a thing, but it is. Sunderland, fresh off promotion, have convinced Granit Xhaka to swap Champions League football with Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap. And we love it.",
      "For just £13million, they’ve signed a player far too good for the bottom half. Sure, he’s had his critics – many of them loud and correct – but the Swiss international has matured and now walks into this team as captain-in-waiting. Sunderland have watched Burnley, Ipswich and others make transfer mistakes and get relegated. Some of their business points to the same mistakes being made, but landing Xhaka is doing things differently.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nThis one shot up the rankings after Pedro tore it up in the Club World Cup. He wouldn’t have made the cut otherwise, but those performances were outrageous. The brace against his boyhood club Fluminense left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "A few Chelsea signings deserve an honourable mention. Jorrel Hato, Estevao and Kendry Paez are three outstaning talents.",
      "",
      "8) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah cost Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, keeping him made little sense, and they weren’t d*cks about it. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "7) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nFinally. Arsenal have signed a striker who isn’t terrified of the 18-yard box. Viktor Gyokeres has been smashing in goals for fun over the last three seasons – 22 in 50 for Coventry, 43 in 49 for Sporting, and then an obscene 54 in 52 last term.",
      "Yes, it’s ‘only the Portuguese league’ and no, he’s not the next Bas Dost. We’re not expecting Erling Haaland numbers from Gyokeres, but we’re still backing him to be a success at the Emirates.",
      "MORE: Gyokeres to Arsenal: Bruno Fernandes second as Liga Portugal to Premier League signings ranked",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",

      "",
      "5) Martin Zubimendi (Arsenal)\nZubimendi has looked very promising in pre-season, with Mikel Arteta delighted to build his team around the Spanish defensive midfielder as his anchor. He should help Martin Odegaard get back to his best and now Declan Rice can relax, knowing that his full-time position is further up the pitch, providing support for Gabriel Martinelli on the left.",
      "The ex-Real Sociedad star looks like the calming presence every top team needs in the middle of the park. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",

      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",

      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",

Perhaps the theory is that if Thomas Frank can coach a 20-goal campaign out of Bryan Mbeumo, he might just work wonders for Solanke. One thing we do know: The Golden Boot would get him on the plane to the World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nManchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million; it feels like they may have made a familiar mistake just because he is the wrong side of 28. But he scored 16 Premier League goals last season and remains Villa’s first-choice striker (we presume), and he will be supremely motivated ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United)\nSesko was the man left standing in the Manchester United striker position when the music stopped, but he scored only 13 Bundesliga goals in 24/25 so it feels like a massive ask for him to come to the Premier League and win the Golden Boot with a club that struggled with chance creation (and everything else) last season.",
      "",
      "6=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nThe odds have come in from 25/1 to 20/1 for the most expensive striker signing of the summer, but he did massively underscore according to his xG last season for Eintracht Frankfurt. Perhaps there is value to be found in backing Ekitike here; he did score in the Community Shield, after all.",
      "",
      "6=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nThe stand-out player as Chelsea won the Club World Cup but it’s tricky to envision a 15-goal Premier League season becoming the 25 goals – at least – necessary to win the Golden Boot. Mind you, we do think Chelsea might win the Premier League title after that summer.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nLooked excellent for Chelsea at the Club World Cup and in pre-season, with the Brazilian seemingly ready to lead the line ahead of Delap. The Brazilian has never scored more than 10 Premier League goals before, but he has never played in the Premier League with Cole Palmer, Estevao, Jamie Gittens and Pedro Neto before.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United, for now)\nNow we hit the big boys. Isak is a 7/1 shot to win the Golden Boot despite the fact that he might not kick a ball in the Premier League until after the transfer window has closed. Will he eventually play for Newcastle United, Liverpool or (don’t laugh) Tottenham?",

      "It seems that Gianluigi Donnarumma’s sudden availability has piqued the interest of one of the Manchester clubs: the wrong one…",
      "Donnarumma is desperate for a new club after it was made abundantly clear to the Italy goalkeeper that his services are no longer needed at PSG.",
      "First, the European champions signed his replacement, Lucas Chevalier, and in case Donnarumma had not quite got the message, he was left out of the squad for the UEFA Super Cup final before which Luis Enrique explained that he preferred ‘a different profile’ of goalkeeper.",
      "Hailing Donnarumma as “one of the very best goalkeepers out there and an even better man” makes it no less bitter a pill to swallow for a Champions League winner who intended to stay in Paris if renewal terms were agreeable. No doubt Enzo Raiola used interest anticipated from the Premier League as leverage in those doomed negotiations.",
      "Now Raiola and Donnarumma are left to gauge the level of genuine interest in signing one of the world’s top goalkeepers.",
      "Reports suggest Manchester City are keenest of the clubs who could afford the salary Donnarumma, currently on £210,000 a week at PSG, would demand on top of a transfer fee in the region of £25million.",
      "For City, though, such opportunism is unnecessary. For a few good reasons.",
      "First, they have already signed a goalkeeper this summer. City took their chance to match Newcastle’s offer to Burnley for James Trafford and the England stopper was delighted to return to the club he left in 2023.",
      "Now, Newcastle have been swerved by many players this summer and the allure of going back to his roots was strong. But ahead of a World Cup he intends to be a part of, would Trafford have returned just to sit on the bench when the No.1 shirt at Newcastle could have been his?",
      "Trafford, almost certainly, will have been given the nod to say that he will be City’s first choice. If not immediately then soon enough. A lot sooner than he might hope if Donnarumma follows him though the Etihad door.",
      "Did City need a new keeper at all? Ederson might not be the perfect goalkeeper – there isn’t one – but he has been perfect for City and the way Pep Guardiola insists upon dominating opponents.",
      "After eight years between Pep’s posts, around his 32nd birthday on Sunday, there are sensible sketches of a succession plan for Ederson. It is thought that any advances from Galatasaray might be welcomed and whether it is this summer or next, there is no doubt change is coming.",
      "The prospect of Donnarumma taking City’s gloves is bound to intrigue. But it would be a change too far.",
      "Ederson and Donnarumma have featured on every list of the world’s best goalkeepers for last five years but that is one of the few things they might have in common. As keepers, they are very different.",
      "Guardiola employs Ederson as a first line of attack more than a last line of defence. Which is fine when City have been as dominant as they have been since the Brazilian was brought from Benfica. The quality of his passing – the choice, variety and range – is just as important to Guardiola, perhaps more so, as the trustworthiness of his hands.",
      "You could argue that very few keepers have the talent in their feet that Ederson possesses. But Donnarumma isn’t close enough to make a swap viable.",
      "Donnarumma’s qualities lie in the more traditional aspects of goalkeeping. There are few better shot-stoppers in the world, because of the Italian’s size, speed, positional nous, and reactions. If you are looking for a keeper to guard your goal, Donnarumma is your man. If you’re minded to pick one to ping passes in possession, he is not. Which is a large part of why Luis Enrique ditched him.",
      "For Guardiola, open-minded though he is, that is a non-negotiable. One of his first acts as City boss was to bin Joe Hart and sign Claudio Bravo. A fantastic goalminder replaced by a playmaker in mitts. It set the tone for the next nine years under the Catalan.",
      "The traits he looks for in a goalkeeper are a non-negotiable. And Donnarumma simply doesn’t possess the right mix. Trafford is a better fit.",
      "🚨 MORE ON THE SUMMER TRANSFER FROM F365\n👉 Wirtz, Gyokeres, Mbeumo: Top 10 Premier League signings of the summer\n👉 Isak goes Full Kane in Liverpool transfer saga, and you never go Full Kane\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "There is a club across Manchester, though, who would benefit from a goalkeeper of Donnarumma’s type…",
      "United certainly need a new No.1. They appear tempted to kid themselves and persist with Andre Onana in their net while they throw resources at other priorities. Sure, their impotent forward line and the gaping hole in their midfield do command more urgency during this summer reset. But no one could watch United shamble through last season and pretend Onana is the reliable presence Ruben Amorim needs in his goal.",
      "From the half-hearted interest they showed in Emiliano Martinez, it would appear that United acknowledge the problem. And Donnarumma offers a golden opportunity to fix it.",
      "Of course Amorim wants a No.1 who can play with the ball at his feet but his goalkeeping priorities are weighted differently to Guardiola. If they are not, they really should be.",
      "More than anything, Amorim wants a reliable last line, one who relishes the responsibility of digging United out of the holes they dig for themselves. Not a keeper like Onana who has spent his two seasons at Old Trafford reaching for shovels.",
      "Onana was signed in part to improve United in possession. Maybe he is the Cameroonian Cruyff but he’s too busy fighting fires – and lighting his own – to pull strings.",
      "Which highlights that, in their sticks, United need a top-class goalkeeper above all else. In Donnarumma, they have an opportunity to sign one.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma’s agent has accused PSG of ‘zero respect’ and said his client will likely move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly agreed to join Manchester City after an ‘exchange’ with Pep Guardiola.",
      "Manchester United are considering a loan move for Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "James Trafford could have a battle to land the City No.1 spot with the club intersted in Champions League winner Gianluigi Donnarumma.",

      "Salia will join upon his 18th birthday in August, before which the Magpies will be thoroughly exploring possible loan avenues for a player who has scored seven goals in 39 first-team games.",

      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "Denner Evangelista (Corinthians to Chelsea, £11.5m, June 2026)\nThe cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",

      "",
      "Modou Keba Cisse (LASK to Aston Villa, £4.3m, July 2026)\nThe latest in a lengthening line of young defenders signed from across Europe, teenage centre-half Cisse will spend one more season in Austria before joining up with Villa ahead of next season.",
      "“This marks a major step in my career, but I know the real work starts now,” Cisse said. “The Premier League is a dream – not every player gets this opportunity.”",

But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

      "This opens the door for Bournemouth to add to the scoring, so Liverpool to win and both teams to score at 6/4 with Sky Bet should go close.",
      "The case for an Aston Villa win is very compelling at 6/5 with Sky Bet when assessing all the evidence.",
      "Alexander Isak is missing for Newcastle in a saga that has been managed appallingly by those advising him - it didn't need to be like this.",
      "Of course, Eddie Howe has managed the situation perfectly, giving Isak the disappointed dad treatment rather than going too heavy on him in public. Howe is a master in these situations, but one area in management where he does struggle, looking at his recor,d is getting a team to start the season fast.",
      "Across the first three league games of a season for each club he's managed, he's only working at a 1.25 points per game ratio (P24 W8 D6 L10) and a winless pre-season won't have helped preparations for this one.",
      "Across the Champions League and Premier League, Villa are unbeaten in 24 home games, winning the last seven - including beating Newcastle 4-1 in April.",
      "If there's one fixture flying under the radar that screams goals at the prices this weekend, it's this one. I'm here banging the drum for the over 2.5 goals line at 4/6 with Sky Bet as a base to build a bet from.",
      "Brighton like to be positive at home and play with attacking risk in committing bodies forward, but that leaves gaps which expose their centre-backs. That's why backing the over line in their games last season was a betting-friendly angle, with 27 of their 38 games producing three or more goals.",
      "This has the smell of a goalless grind, doesn't it?",
      "I'm struggling to see how Sunderland score goals at this level. They only scored 1.29 goals per game last season - the eighth-highest in the Sky Bet Championship. Even Sheffield Wednesday averaged more.",
      "Regis Le Bris is someone who is suited to defence-first football and that is very hard to implement in this league with the quality in opposition ranks. Low-probability chances get taken.",
      "Le Bris will want to make this a scrap, kill the tempo, and smother the game. It's Sunderland's best chance for points.",
      "I wouldn't talk you out of the 0-0 correct score at a juicy price of 11/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Now I'm not for one second suggesting Scott Parker's side are about to storm North London and walk away with three points, but I do think the markets are disrespecting Burnley's potential to keep this competitive and overrating Spurs slightly based on their Super Cup heroics.",
      "This is a tough gig for Thomas Frank. Expectation is internally very high and Frank has no experience of managing workloads within a squad asked to compete across four competitions.",
      "They looked strong and organised for large parts vs PSG, but I think we need to treat that piece of form very carefully as the French side were clearly miles undercooked.",
      "Burnley aren't going to change their rigid and pragmatic style going up a level. This could be fiddly for Spurs as Burnley should be able to cover their +1.5 goal start handicap at 4/5 with Sky Bet, meaning we just need them not to lose by two or more goals.",
      "Jhon Arias could just take the Premier League by storm in this Wolves team. All the evidence suggests he'll adapt pretty quickly, be a main man in attack and judging by what I saw at the Club World Cup and from people who follow the Brazilian league, he has the quality to thrive in England.",
      "Wolves have played the Brazilian market very shrewdly in recent years, with Joao Gomes and Andre showing real adaptability to the league.",
      "Quick, direct and a great drawer of fouls, Arias will be to the fore for Wolves as they look to take advantage of Man City's vulnerabilities in transition without Rodri. Back him to be fouled at least twice through the Sky Bet BuildABet function at Evens.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "By Nick Wright and Adam Smith",
      "Friday 15 August 2025 06:16, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 23:50, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has described Manchester United as \"reactionary\" and being in \"no man's land\" - and has called on his club to \"make a plan and stick to it.\"",
      "Rashford departed United to join Barcelona on loan for the upcoming season after a similar, successful spell at Aston Villa for the second half of last season. This was after the forward had been frozen out of United's first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And now, Rashford has hit out at the club's strategy in recent years - saying the club have not begun a transition yet because they do not have a recognisable style of play throughout the club.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been: we're hungry to win, so we'll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it's reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction's always changing, you can't expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team - you're not there by accident.",
      "\"We've been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months - what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we've been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it's like the actual transition's not started yet.",
      "\"To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel - it's not easy. Because if it's not going well, the fans demand [change].",
      "\"But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we've had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of - you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed which managers have been the most influential in his career - citing Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as inspirations - but he left out Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The forward also went into detail about Mourinho's desire to win at United - irrespective of how well you played.",
      "\"They're different but because we've had so many different managers, it's impossible for me to compare [them],\" added Rashford.",
      "\"Up until Jose, I never had a manager who was so fixated on winning. Van Gaal was fixated on winning but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose didn't care.",
      "\"Of course, if he could choose, he would want you to play well, but if you win, you win and move onto the next game. He had this attitude.",
      "\"And it was confusing for me as all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style and winning in a certain way.",
      "\"And in the beginning I was angry all the time - because we had not played well and we won. But because we won and he is a manager who is just a winner, he didn't bring up the points that you know were missing from that last game. Because we've won.",
      "\"But when we lost, he would bring up the points then. After six months, I learned to respect it and reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed the importance of the move to Barcelona on his chances of making England's World Cup squad next summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was named in new head coach Thomas Tuchel's first Three Lions squad back in March - but missed the June camp due to injury.",
      "\"I try not to put too much pressure on the England set-up,\" said the Barcelona forward. \"It's clearly something I want to do.",
      "\"But you don't get that without putting in the hard work just day in, day out. And showing the hard work on the pitch. That's a knock-on effect to the stuff I'll be doing day in, day out.",
      "\"This current group of English players is extremely talented, it's going to be disappointing if we don't manage to go on and do something really special because I think we've come on a lot. For the last few years, it's been: the next step is to go on and win.\"",
      "Rashford also paid tribute to his former club Villa - saying the brief spell at Unai Emery's side went \"exactly how it was supposed to be\" after struggling at United.",
      "\"The timing of me going to Villa, now looking back, it was the exact time for me to do something like that,\" he said. \"The response and reaction of what I got from the people at the club and the fans, it was what I needed in that moment.",
      "\"Six months on, I feel like everything is completely different. Everything I did at Villa, apart from the injury at the end, was exactly how it was supposed to be. The club's on the up so the atmosphere at the club in that dressing room was positive.\""

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 16:54, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
