      "Vitor Roque's agent is bracing for offers around €50million (£44m) in the January transfer window. Manchester United and several European clubs are reportedly closely monitoring his situation at Palmeiras.",
      "The forward has netted 13 goals in 28 matches since making his comeback to the Brazilian side from Barcelona. Roque was purchased for roughly £22million in February, setting a record as the most expensive player in South American football history, and his impressive form in Brazil has caught the attention of numerous clubs.",
      "He is now sparking rumours of a potential move in January. United and Chelsea are clubs credited as the 'most interested' parties in the race, with West Ham United also showing interest.",
      "Ruben Amorim is said to be mulling over adding a new striker to his squad at Old Trafford to challenge Benjamin Sesko. The United manager has barely utilised Joshua Zirkzee, and speculation about the Dutchman's future has triggered a possible chain reaction.",
      "Fabrizio Romano recently dismissed rumours about Endrick moving to United as having zero chance of happening, despite the teenager getting the green light to leave Real Madrid. The expectation is that he will join Lyon on loan.",
      "Roque's name continues to circulate in the transfer gossip columns. In conversation with Globo Esporte, the striker's agent disclosed that his team are anticipating bids when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Andre Cury, one of the agents at Link Sports, said: \"Today we're receiving a barrage of calls from European clubs, mainly Premier League and Italian clubs. They're calling to ask about the price and terms, but we're in the middle of the season.",
      "\"We already had an offer from the Arab world of 35 million euros, which wasn't of interest, and now we're going to get a proposal in the region of 50 million euros from the Premier League.\" The outlet claims Cury ruled out United being among those to approach him.",
      "Roque's agent also said, \"The plan was to come back here, get strong again, and also study the market. If a good offer comes along for everyone and they understand that he has to leave, he's open to listening, but he's very happy at Palmeiras.",
      "\"The focus now is on trying to win the Brazilian Championship and the Libertadores Cup.\" Their league campaign continues until early December, with Palmeiras currently sitting at the summit, holding a slender one-point advantage over Flamengo.",
      "Roque will face Flamengo in the Copa Libertadores final on November 29. The season in Brazil concludes three-and-a-half weeks before January's transfer window begins.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane has accused Liverpool supporters of lacking 'class' after Trent Alexander-Arnold was booed on his return to Anfield. Arne Slot's side overcame Real Madrid 1-0 at Anfield in the Champions League.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister's header was enough to secure a vital three points for the Merseysiders. However, one of the most memorable moments of the contest came when Alexander-Arnold came on from the bench and was heavily jeered by the crowd.",
      "Liverpool supporters were left hurt when the England international departed the club as a free agent in the summer. The Reds did secure a £10million fee for his services due to Los Blancos' desire to play him at the Club World Cup, but fans were still disappointed by his exit.",
      "After watching him get booed on his return to the club he grew up at, Keane took a swipe at the supporters who were so hostile. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"The reputation of Liverpool fans is that they are loyal and a level up from most supporters.",
      "\"But I think for any player to go back, to boo him, people pay their money to go and that's fine, you're not going to argue with supporters.\"",
      "He also added: \"Liverpool fans will obviously think, 'We are the biggest club in the world' like all supporters. I'm not saying you give him the thumbs up for leaving you. But why would you go to a match and boo a lad who has played 260/270 games, stats are fantastic. You don't have to wish him luck in Madrid.",
      "\"But to go to the effort of thinking, 'I'm going to boo this kid' as a local lad and Liverpool fans, for some reason, think they've got class. No, Liverpool fans have to have a good look at themselves.",
      "\"The beauty with Trent over the last year or two is that he has said very little, he's not been one to say, 'Oh I'd love to stay here.’",
      "\"He has actually kept his mouth shut and sometimes that's not a bad thing to do. How many times do you see players say, 'Oh I love this club' and then they leave. He kept it cool.”",
      "After the match, Slot praised Alexander-Arnold's work with him the previous season, which saw the right-back contribute four goals and ten assists as the Reds won the Premier League in Slot's first campaign. The Dutchman said: \"He (Alexander-Arnold) lost so that is tough.",
      "\"I said something like 'keep going' to him. I honestly didn't know exactly what I said to him. He has been special to this club, he has been special to me. And he is a special human being.",

      "Liverpool were admirers of Ruben Amorim before he made the move to Manchester United, a new book has revealed. The Reds even considered him a candidate for the vacancy at Anfield before they eventually secured Arne Slot from Feyenoord.",
      "After Jurgen Klopp announced his planned summer departure from the club in January 2024, the Liverpool hierarchy got to work finding a replacement for him. Names like Xabi Alonso remained on the shortlist for the job but after the now-Real Madrid boss turned down the offer, other potential candidates began cropping up.",
      "A new book, 'Walk On: Inside Arne Slot’s Liverpool', written by James Pearce, reveals that Amorim was the man most-linked to the Anfield job following his success with Sporting Lisbon. Pearce writes: \"After Alonso publicly ruled himself out of contention, the name most persistently linked with Liverpool in the media was Sporting Lisbon coach Amorim, who was about to clinch his second Primeira Liga title with the Portuguese giants.\"",
      "However, while the Reds admired Amorim's success in Portugal, they were concerned about how he set up his team and his style of play, which was not deemed as a good fit for the Liverpool squad. Pearce continues: \"Amorim was a serious contender and boasted the best record in terms of player availability. However, that was partly attributed to him working in a less intense league.",
      "\"There was plenty to admire but Edwards and Hughes had doubts whether his preference for a three-man defence would suit the squad he would be inheriting at Anfield. There were also concerns that his slower, less dynamic style of play might fail to energise supporters.",
      "\"Hughes held talks with Amorim in Lisbon but the Sporting boss was subsequently informed that Liverpool were going in a different direction.\"",
      "Liverpool ended up opting for Slot, who had won the Eredivisie with Feyenoord and finished runner-up in the UEFA Conference League in the 2021/22 season. Pearce adds: \"Slot was always the preferred candidate.",
      "\"They loved how his football connected with the emotional fanbase at Feyenoord, they felt it wasn't too much of a change from Klopp's approach and they knew he was well versed in working in a sporting director model.\"",
      "While Amorim has seemingly finally settled at United, Liverpool's decision to select Slot seems to be the best move for both club and manager. The Dutchman won the Premier League in his first year in charge and revitalised a Liverpool squad that had only claimed the League Cup in Klopp's final campaign.",
      "Slot spent a whopping £446million over the summer and secured some star signings like Florian Wirtz, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. While there has been a dip in form in recent weeks, the Reds looked to be back to their best on Tuesday with a 1-0 win over familiar foes Real Madrid.",

      "An explosive summer transfer window for Manchester United continues to produce fallout this season. And not just at Old Trafford, either, following fresh word from Stamford Bridge concerning Alejandro Garnacho's development.",
      "The Argentina international left Ruben Amorim's squad under a cloud of controversy and joined Chelsea in a £40million move. The reduced fee was representative of United's ambition to offload the player, who appears to have turned a new leaf.",
      "Garnacho's profile at Old Trafford was dented considerably following Amorim's arrival at the club. There were never any real concerns regarding the winger's on-field ability, but his position became untenable largely due to doubts over his character.",
      "The South American was implicated in a scandal around this time last year, having been accused of leaking team news. He later branded United's 2024/25 season as \"s***\" and alluded to a potential summer exit after he was dropped for the Europa League final defeat to Spurs.",
      "Garnacho's brother, Roberto, also poured fuel on the fire with comments he made criticising the manager's decisions on social media. In the end, the player was deemed too troublesome and completed the move to west London after five years in Manchester.",
      "But any signs of rebelliousness appear to have dissipated in the capital. That's after Give Me Sport reported Chelsea staff have been impressed by the attacker's \"attitude and intensity\" in training, even staying late to work on his product in the final third.",
      "His place in Enzo Maresca's plans is far from absolute, however. Garnacho has one direct goal involvement in eight outings for the Blues and has had to settle for a place on the bench in Chelsea's last six Premier League outings.",
      "Whether it's down to the environment, his new coach or other factors, reports suggest he has changed for the better nonetheless. However, those at United may still wonder whether it's merely a matter of time before Garnacho's frustrations bubble to the surface once more in time.",
      "Amid a surge of attacking recruitment over the summer, there was plenty for United fans to get excited about ahead of this season. And 1999 Treble-winner Teddy Sheringham has been blown away by the impact made by Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Brazilian arrived alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in a complete renovation of the forward line. And Sheringham, who scored in the iconic comeback win over Bayern Munich more than 25 years ago, is expecting big things from the former Wolves talisman.",
      "\"He seemed like he’s found his place in the team – I don’t know whether someone has spoken to him about stepping up to the plate and taking on that mantle of being the focal point of the team, but he’s definitely taken that on in the last month.",
      "\"He could be the difference between United being an average team and a very good team. Long may his form continue.\"",
      "Cunha scored his first United goal in last month's impressive 4-2 victory over Brighton. However, fans will be desperate to see the versatile forward improve his returns even further as the Red Devils climb the rungs in the Premier League ladder.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Edward Glazer, one of the five siblings who hold a controlling stake in Manchester United, has shed light on how the US family reaches consensus on key decisions concerning the football club. Despite enduring harsh criticism from fans over the millions of dollars of debt accrued since their takeover in 2005, the Glazer family has maintained a majority stake in the club.",
      "In 2024, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe finalised a deal to purchase a 27.7 per cent stake in the club - valued at approximately $1.6billion (£1.25bn). As part of the agreement, Ratcliffe has assumed control of football operations, assisted by Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada.",
      "Earlier this season, speculation about a potential takeover was rife when Turki Al-Sheikh posted on social media that the Reds were in 'advanced negotiations with a new investor'. On X, Al-Sheikh wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "He followed this up with: \"My (yesterday's) post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing, the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.\"",
      "\"Just to clarify, I'm not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "At the time, United officials were taken aback by Al-Sheikh's activity, claiming that the report were 'news to them'. The Times' Charlotte Duncker did explain, though, how Ratcliffe could be left with no option if the Glazers decided to sell the club.",
      "\"I think for the right price, they definitely would. There is a clause within Ratcliffe's agreement when he bought the club - I think it was triggered in August this year - that meant if the right offer came in - and I think that it was over something like $33 a share - that the Glazers could sell the whole club.",
      "\"Not just their portion of it, but Sir Ratcliffe will be bought out, as well, so there is potential that the Glazers could sell the entire club but, at the minute, it just seems like a strange one with this news, this hype and this excitement that's been triggered by this one tweet.\"",
      "Speculation continues to swirl around a potential takeover at Old Trafford, although no formal discussions have taken place. Back in April, Edward Glazer - the youngest of the Glazer siblings - was quizzed about their decision-making process within the football club.",
      "When asked about the rationale behind their decision to sell around a quarter of United to Ratcliffe during a talk with students at the Kogod School of Business in Washington, he explained: \"I think that... We're a family business, and it was really a decision we made collectively.",
      "\"Not every decision is six-nothing. But, ultimately, why we have been successful as a family business is that we've always kind of agreed that, if the majority of family members want to do something, we realise we are in a family business and we have to do it.",
      "\"One day it might be something that I'm in favour of. The next day, it may be something I'm not in favour. It was a family decision [the minority takeover].\"",

      "He suffered an injury setback earlier this season after impressing for United's youth teams, previously stating: \"Life couldn't get any worse.\" However, the 16-year-old, who celebrated his birthday earlier this month, has now shared what is a much more promising update that will please United supporters.",
      "Sporting his United training kit, Kai took to Instagram and posted two hour-glass emojis, suggesting his return to the pitch might be imminent. Previously, the youngster kept his followers informed about his recovery process by sharing pictures from Dubai, where he was seen without a protective boot on his foot.",
      "Kai turned heads at the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland this summer, a tournament where his father also made waves as an up-and-coming talent at Everton. The young Red Devil was making significant strides through the club's youth system, earning a call-up to United's Under-19s squad. Remarkably, he competed against professionals four years his senior when he was just 15.",
      "Before his senior call-up, he netted a stunning goal for the Under-18s, a left-footed volley that found its way into the top corner, echoing some of his father's most memorable strikes. Despite battling injury in recent weeks, Kai took a moment to back United academy product Marcus Rashford after the England star scored against Elche in a 3-1 La Liga victory.",
      "The young striker shared a snap of Rashford celebrating his goal on his own social media platforms.",
      "Even before the injury, Rooney Snr, now 40, sought to keep Kai level-headed and not get his hopes up. Speaking with Gary Neville, he said: \"[He has] my physique, but he'll be taller than me and he's a goal-scorer, he's in the box, he sniffs chances out and that's his game, so he's doing okay.\"",
      "Fellow United legend Neville then asked: \"Obviously you can't remember yourself, but is he at that sort of level where you think he's got a chance, or is it too early?\"",
      "Rooney replied: \"I think that it's too early, you never know. I think that he's showing potential and good signs. So, obviously, he'll be at United now for the next two years, and that's when they make decisions on you, so just wait and see really.\"",

      "The striker had been on United's radar for a number of years, with Wilcox and his fellow bigwigs fighting off strong competition from Newcastle to land Sesko's signature. But the Slovenian is yet to justify his price tag, albeit after just 11 games. Former captain Gary Neville recently described him as looking 'awkward' and 'miles off it', with Sesko having only scored two goals for the Red Devils.",
      "But Wilcox, who was promoted to the role of director of football in June, predicts that the ex-Red Bull Salzburg star will come good. Speaking to club media, Wilcox proclaimed: \"Benji, at the top end, he's going to be an amazing player.",
      "\"It's difficult to be the no.9 at United and I know sometimes that Matheus and Bryan are getting a lot of credit, but the runs that Benji is making is also helping Matheus [Cunha] and Bryan [Mbeumo] as well. All four of them have done really well, the summer signings from last year, they are top professionals.\"",
      "Wilcox's comments come after Neville gave a scathing assessment of Sesko's performances, admitting that 'the jury's still out. \"He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in, like Cunha and Mbeumo,\" Neville told NBC Sports.",
      "\"He looks awkward, his touch was off a few times when balls went over the top. For £80m [sic], yes he's young and still settling but you want to see something more.\"",
      "However, England legend Gary Lineker is more positive about the 22-year-old, describing him as 'promising'. \"One thing I would say is that their recruitment for the first time in some time looks pretty good,\" Lineker said on the Rest Is Football.",
      "Will Benjamin Sesko be successful at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"Cunha looks a really good player and Mbeumo looks a really good player. Sesko I think might show something, I think he is promising, so I think it has been better recruitment, but time will tell on that as well.\"",
      "Sesko hopes to prove his doubters wrong and score his third goal for United when Ruben Amorim's side face Tottenham on Saturday in London. The Slovenia international will then be aiming to help his country qualify for the World Cup, as they host Kosovo and travel to Sweden later this month.",

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has explained how the club’s recruitment process works as the January transfer window approaches. United were busy in the summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens, but will have another opportunity to add further players in the New Year.",
      "The club forked out over £200million to bolster Ruben Amorim’s squad in the last window yet still have areas they want to improve, with central midfield top of the list. Carlos Baleba, Connor Gallagher, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are among the players they are interested in, although securing one of them in January may prove difficult.",
      "Nevertheless, Wilcox, Amorim and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell are holding regular meetings to discuss potential targets and the sort of players they need. Wilcox, who joined United in April 2024 having previously been Southampton’s director of football, has lifted the lid on the process in an interview with club podcast Inside Carrington.",
      "“Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable, with Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach,” he said. “When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process.",
      "“The data team are involved in the process and we will then focus all our attention on certain players. It is really important then that we do the background checks on whether they are clean-living professionals. This is really important.”",
      "United’s form has picked up in recent weeks, with a three-game winning streak ended by a 2-2 draw against Nottingham Forest on the weekend. Amorim’s side are eighth in the Premier League but just a point off the top four, which is a major target this season.",
      "“We've just got to continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben's idea,” Wilcox added. “Ruben has got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for. We have got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, it is really important and we have to put the jigsaw pieces together.",
      "“Putting the jigsaw pieces together, we would love to have all of the pieces in place where we can see a very, very clear picture but, whilst we are building and whilst we are building the picture, it is even more difficult when you lose some football matches because people start questioning things. But we are really clear, myself and Ruben, [chief executive] Omar [Berrada], the ownership, we are really clear on the direction of travel and this is really important.”",

      "AC Milan and Inter Milan have officially signed a deal that sees them take ownership of the San Siro and its surrounding area - which risks delaying Manchester United's new stadium plans.",
      "The Italian giants have sealed an agreement that will allow them to invest £1billion to build a new stadium and undertake a wider transformation of the location. That means Old Trafford chiefs may be forced to wait in line given the Milan clubs and United both share the same partner.",
      "Foster + Partners is the firm behind designing Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 100,000 capacity hopes, with a timeline for completion of 2030 touted, and has been confirmed as a stakeholder in the design and development of the new San Siro. They are to undertake work to build a new 71,500-seater ground, with much of the current stadium to be knocked down. That could leave the developer's hands full, with hopes that building work could be completed by 2031, in time for the European Championship the following year.",
      "United continue to work with Fosters but with a caveat. The club told their Fan Forum meeting last month the company would be the master planner, but did not commit to a developer.",
      "Minutes read: \"The club relayed it is working collaboratively with Foster+ Partners as the master planner for the wider regeneration project and that no official appointment has been made for the engineering and construction contract for the new stadium build project.\"",
      "Milan and Inter are ready to get to work, however. September saw the Milan City Council approve the £167m sale of the stadium and surrounding area to the two clubs.",
      "Around 91 per cent of the ground is set to be demolished — the first and third tier stands and part of the second tier will be removed, and the remaining sections will be preserved by creating a park and pedestrian pathways. Fosters are responsible for the urban planning that takes place.",
      "Statement read: \"AC Milan and FC Internazionale Milano today announce the signing of the deed of sale with the Municipality of Milan for the acquisition of the San Siro Great Urban Function, including the Meazza Stadium and its surrounding area.",
      "\"The construction of the new stadium and the urban regeneration project for the San Siro district represents a new chapter for the City of Milan and both Clubs. The strategic milestone reflects the shared ambition of AC Milan and Inter and their respective owners, RedBird and funds managed by Oaktree, for long-term sporting success and value-enhancing investment to support the Clubs’ sustainable growth.",
      "\"The Clubs have entrusted Foster + Partners and MANICA with the design and development of the new world-class stadium and the masterplan for the surrounding area. The stadium will meet the highest international standards and is destined to become a new architectural icon for the City of Milan. As part of the project, a new center of excellence will also be established, reflecting the sporting and cultural vocation that defines the San Siro district and the entire city, while redefining the urban space through innovation, sustainability and accessibility.",
      "\"The transaction, completed through Stadio San Siro S.p.A., was supported by a financing provided by international banking institutions Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, as co-lead arrangers, and by the Clubs’ banking partners, Banco BPM and BPER Banca.\"",

      "However, Tottenham bounced straight back on Tuesday night with a convincing 4-0 victory over FC Copenhagen in the Champions League.

      "\"Everyone loves it when Manchester United come to town and everyone raises their game, so I don't think it's this type of fixture that will be a problem for Thomas Frank. Tottenham will be up for it and so will their supporters - so it will be a fantastic game.",

      "His eldest son, Brooklyn, who finds himself at the heart of an ongoing family rift with wife Nicola Peltz, was notably missing from the Windsor Castle ceremony.",

      "Romeo, 23, who is David's second eldest behind Brooklyn, 26, praised his father via an Instagram post following the knighthood ceremony, writing: \"No one deserves this more than you, love you so much xxx. Congrats Sir dad [laughing face emoji] @davidbeckham.\"",
      "Everton loanee Grealish, 30, then responded with two clapping hands emojis.",
      "Given Romeo was the sole Beckham offspring to publicly acknowledge the honour on social media, he was bombarded with questions about Brooklyn, with numerous followers querying his brother's absence. Rumours are swirling that the root of the disagreement is due to a fallout between Brooklyn and Romeo over the latter's past romance with former model Kim Turnbull.",
      "However, other whispers suggest the family feud dates back to Brooklyn's wedding day with Nicola in April 2022, which took place in sunny Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Victoria shared a series of snaps on Instagram, along with a touching tribute to her husband: \"David, from the moment I met you 28 years ago, you've always been so proud to represent your country.",

      "For the ceremony in Berkshire, Beckham was decked out in a grey three-piece suit designed by his wife, marking the first-ever tailored menswear piece from her namesake fashion brand.",
      "\"[King Charles] was quite impressed with my suit,\" Beckham quipped. \"He's the most elegantly dressed man that I know, so he inspired quite a few of my looks over the years and he definitely inspired this look.",

Gyokeres has netted six goals in 14 outings for Arsenal whilst Sesko has managed merely two strikes, though his playing time has been more limited.",
      "Speaking to Oddspedia, Sheringham believes that Mikel Arteta's side might have emerged victorious in the transfer battle. He said: \"Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres were both up for transfers coming into the Premier League, and there was a question of 'who is going to end up with which striker?' I would say in this moment in time, Arsenal look like they've got the better centre-forward.",

      "The Portuguese coach signed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer, with Robson having been impressed by them so far. Captain Marvel believes the additions have already seen the Red Devils progress.",
      "\"I was a manager myself and I always felt that as a manager, you need three years to actually get a settled team for what you want to achieve,\" Robson said. \"It is only very early for him and we have made some really good signings. I can see us developing that little bit better and the club have got to give him that time.",

The goalkeeper followed Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko through the Old Trafford doors, with the club's spending reaching £220m.",
      "They had centred their summer focus on the attack, with Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko signed to strengthen that area of the pitch. But, following Altay Bayindir's shaky start and Andre Onana's horror performance against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, United brought in Lammens and loaned Onana out to Trabzonspor for the season.",

      "\"Tony Coton was putting this guy on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it. He said he was going to be a top signing for us. He has started well but he has got to keep it going. He is very reflective, very professional in his approach.\"",
      "United's 2025 summer transfer window is already proving to be a greater success compared to the 2024 one, with the club spending a similar amount, but the new arrivals have had a much more significant impact. Wilcox insisted United came into the summer with a clear plan and have improved their approach to transfers.",
      "\"Last year's summer window was a lot more chaotic than this one,\" Wilcox explained. \"This one was really calm, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve. These are continuous meetings between myself and Ruben [Amorim] with Chris Vivell and his team underneath.",

      "\"When we sign a player, there is so many people involved in the process. The data team are involved and then we will focus all of our attention on certain players and it is really important that we do our background checks around whether they are clean living professionals - this is really important.\"",

      "Shea Lacey stands out as one of Manchester United's brightest academy prospects at present, with Ruben Amorim taking a personal interest in guiding the teenager's journey towards senior football. The 18-year-old is yet to earn his first-team bow but has caught the eye in the Vertu Trophy alongside the Under 21s this term.",
      "The 2007-born winger found the net during United's 2-0 triumph over Notts County on Tuesday evening. Chido Obi threaded a ball to Lacey down the right flank, and he controlled before slotting home with aplomb.",
      "It marked a clinical strike from the youngster for his third strike of the season. And after an injury-hit 2024/25 campaign, Lacey is now progressing towards first-team involvement, with Amorim monitoring his advancement closely.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Lacey and Amorim have engaged in several private discussions around United's training facilities in recent weeks.",
      "Lacey has enjoyed increased involvement with the senior squad, leading to enhanced focus on charting his path to a debut.",
      "United U21s manager Travis Binnion said: \"It's important the games programme doesn't get in the way of his opportunities with the first team.",
      "\"He's had a good few days with the first team (last week). We speak every day with the first team and get a week ahead in terms of what games he's going to play and what's right for him.",
      "\"I saw Jason at Barnsley and you have conversations with him, (academy head) Stephen Torpey, Ruben and (assistant) Carlos (Fernandes) around who, where, when, what. We are trying to get ahead of it by planning around the games, and you can't do that without the dialogue that we have.\"",
      "Lacey's preferred position is operating as a right attacking midfielder, precisely where Bryan Mbeumo has been deployed this campaign. However, with the ex-Brentford star departing for the African Cup of Nations with Cameroon in December, United are targeting that period to hand Lacey his senior bow.",
      "Given United's limited alternatives to cover for Mbeumo and Amad down the right flank, Lacey might be presented with the ideal opportunity to make his mark at senior level.",
      "Furthermore, should Lacey be given his chance in the first team, he could assist in preserving an 88-year United tradition. The Red Devils have featured an academy graduate in every matchday squad since October 1937.",
      "However, during their 2-2 stalemate with Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Kobbie Mainoo, who has been touted for a January departure from United, remained the sole academy product in the squad.",
      "If Mainoo departs United, this impressive streak could be in jeopardy. Yet, if Lacey or another academy starlet is handed a chance by Amorim, the remarkable run could still carry on.",

      "In that time the winger has returned just 12 goals and is currently away on loan at Aston Villa. It is his third successive loan stint away having fallen out of favour at Old Trafford. United have the option to trigger a 12-month extension in his deal.",
      "That would be common practice, allowing them to retain their asset and demand a fee for him. But those on the red half of Manchester are ready to bypass that opportunity and instead let him leave for free once the summer comes round.",
      "Sancho's contract sees him pocked a mammoth £200,000-a-week, but United no longer want to fork out for those wages and will allow him to exit Old Trafford rather than risk paying his salary for another year if they can't find a buyer, reports TalkSport.",
      "The former England star was linked with a move to Roma in the summer but eventually made his way to Villa Park. Sancho's demise began when he publicly called out Erik ten Hag on social media, which led to him being frozen out and then loaned away.",
      "Even though Ruben Amorim is now at the helm opportunities have not come his way and Sancho was part of the so-called 'Bomb squad' in the summer. He was waiting for a route out of Manchester after Chelsea, where he was on loan last year, paid a penalty fee to avoid signing him permanently.",
      "Sancho has not started a Premier League game for Villa this season and Unai Emery has handed the winger just 69 minutes in the top flight across three substitute appearances. In the recent win over Manchester City he was subbed on and then taken off later in the contest.",
      "Back in the summer Amorim has claimed that the likes of Sancho would not be sold on the cheap and, if their valuation was not met, he would bring them back into the fold.",
      "He said: \"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.\"",

      "Beckham has been awarded the honour for services to sport and charity. The 50-year-old spent most of his football career at Old Trafford, rising through the ranks as part of the famed Class of ‘92 and making 394 appearances for the Red Devils, winning six Premier League titles, the 1999 Champions League, and many other major honours.",
      "Beckham’s footballing success and other ventures have enabled the former England captain to amass substantial wealth. However, his riches are a mere fraction compared to one of his former team-mates.",
      "The Sunday Times Rich List states that David and Victoria Beckham have a combined net worth of £500million. However, former Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini, who played alongside Beckham during his two loan spells at AC Milan, is reportedly worth 20 times more than the England legend.",
      "While Beckham has earned huge sums through various sponsorships and business ventures, Flamini took a different route. In 2008, while he was still playing football, the Frenchman co-founded GFBiochemicals.",
      "The company has become renowned for its production of levulinic acid, which, according to the Daily Mail, helps reduce CO2 emissions during the manufacturing of certain products by up to 80 per cent.",

Your dedication to the things that matter most - your country, your work, your passion, and most of all, your family - has never wavered.",
      "\"The way you've touched so many lives over the years with kindness and humility speaks volumes about the man you are and continues to inspire us every day. But above all else, I'm so, so proud to call you mine. I love you so much.\"",

      "Former United star Brian McClair shared how his much-changed look in recent years led to confusion. McClair won four Premier League titles with United during his 11-year spell as a player, later becoming the director of the club’s youth academy after hanging up his boots.",
      "McClair’s ties to the club span generations through his work on and off the pitch. However, the 61-year-old’s long white hair and beard left United heroes Dimitar Berbatov and Louis Saha stunned during a recent charity game between the Red Devils and Celtic..",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo will retire from football after the 2026 World Cup, according to his former team-mate Nani. Ronaldo is still going strong at the age of 40, playing for Al-Nassr and Portugal, but he is undoubtedly nearing the end of his career.",
      "The veteran forward joined Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in 2023 after leaving Manchester United under a cloud following a falling out. He has continued to plunder goals in the Middle East and still has a starring role in Roberto Martinez's Portugal side, for whom he has a staggering 143 goals in 225 appearances.",
      "But in an interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo has admitted he has thought a lot about retirement. Asked if he knew when he would call time on his career, he replied: “Soon. But I think I will be prepared. It will be tough, of course. It will be difficult? Yes. Probably [I] will cry, yes…",
      "\"I'm [an] open person. [It] will be very, very difficult, yes. But Piers, I prepare my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old, I prepare [for] my future. So I think I will be capable to support that pressure.”",
      "Ronaldo has one eye on the World Cup, which takes place across Canada, the United States and Mexico in June and July next year. Nani played with Ronaldo at United and for Portugal and believes that a successful tournament would provide the perfect opportunity to bow out on a high.",
      "“I think this World Cup is very important for Cristiano Ronaldo,\" he told Covers. \"If he can play and win, that will be the perfect end to his career. I think that will be the time he says, ‘I'm happy, I'm retired now. I'll just drink my coffee and my tea and have peace. I don't want any more training sessions. I don't want anything to do with football.’",
      "“But yeah, he will give his best to help the country, as he's always been doing. I think he's motivated, you can see the way he's been playing. So I think it will be a great season for him as well, and then probably we'll have a chance. We've got a chance.",
      "“I think he needs the team to help. He needs to be connected with the team to help the team as well, because it's very important. He can score goals. His presence on the field and with the team is very important to help the team have the confidence to perform.",
      "“All the players around him need to be at their best, because if all the players around him are at their best, with no problems in their heads, and then perform for him and help him to achieve his targets as well, and he does the same thing, I think we'll have a great chance.”",

      "Manchester United's director of football Jason Wilcox expressed it best himself this week when discussing the club's transfer strategy.",
      "\"Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost. Are they attainable? With Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach,\" he told MUTV's Inside Carrington podcast.",
      "In truth, this is exactly what any self-respecting Premier League club should be doing. If United are going to be sustained challengers in the top four, they need to be planning all-year round.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Wilcox did not say which position they are looking to strengthen next in the market. But it doesn't take a genius to know that the central defensive midfield slot will be the next to be looked at.",
      "Casemiro is out of contract at the end of the season and while United hold an option to extend that deal by a further year, the Reds would want the Brazilian to extend on lower terms. This will, of course, require fresh negotiations and the 33-year-old is under no obligations to agree to them.",
      "Therefore, when he does leave which could be 2026 or 2027, United will need to sign a replacement. When they do that, Wilcox has dropped a huge hint as to where they will be looking.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn’t take too much risk in this area and we needed players we could plug in and play with little transition time,\" he explained. \"Senne we were always looking at goalkeepers who have huge potential and Senne was available so we decided to move. It wasn’t a knee-jerk reaction.\"",
      "Like bolstering the attack, the search for a new defensive midfielder looks like it will be focused on players who can slot in seamlessly - especially those who are currently in the Premier League. There is a catch to this plan, though.",
      "Firstly, signing a player from a Premier League club comes at a premium. You only have to look back at the deal for Mbeumo to see that the negotiations can be long and difficult with division rivals.",
      "Then, once that deal is finally complete, you can end up spending more than you originally planned for. That is not to say that Mbeumo is struggling to live up to his price tag - but it is something to consider.",
      "When you take into account the big defensive midfield signings in recent years like Moises Caicedo to Chelsea and Declan Rice to Arsenal, the £100m mark has already been breached. That is also the figure that Brighton quoted United for Carlos Baleba last summer.",
      "Sadly, his performances this season do not merit such a high fee. So therein lies the problem for Wilcox and his recruitment team.",
      "Signing a player from the Premier League to replace Casemiro would be ideal. However, that will cost United big money and, currently, there is not one target who fits the mould well enough to constitute paying that money.",
      "United may need to go back to the drawing board and spread their net further afield.",

      "\"Even if the time at Manchester United wasn't excellent for him, far from it, but they were pretty happy.\" The love of the Napoli fanbase will be one of the driving factors for the United recruits switching Old Trafford for the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.",

      "Few would have predicted this summer that Hojlund would be assisted by Kevin De Bruyne during this campaign. But that is how it has played out for the forward as the pair joined forces to devastating effect in the victory over Sporting CP in the Champions League.",
      "Hojlund will likely have to do without De Bruyne until February due to injury and Bettoni has warned that the striker will need to adapt his style in the interim. \"On paper, we have not seen so much of Hojlund without De Bruyne so far,\" he concluded.",
      "\"Technically it will be more about holding the ball and a few less runs into the spaces, but this is just technically because in games when Napoli decide to sit deep and not press too high and not try to win the ball high up the pitch, they will need to counter-attack and Hojlund will be a very important player in this phase as well. Against other teams, without De Bruyne, Hojlund will need to be a lot more involved in the link-up and much more solid physically so that he can hold up the ball, link-up with the wingers and the central midfielders, as well.",
      "\"It will be a lot more about the link-up play and trying to work well with his teammates rather than just trying to make forward runs and runs into spaces.\"",

      "Speculation ahead of the January transfer window is intensifying, with suggestions that Ruben Amorim's side could be busy during the winter market. Several big names are being linked with a move to United, with a new midfielder the priority.",
      "Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson is a primary target after his impressive performances at the City Ground. United have reignited their interest in Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "Away from midfielders, new attackers are also being heavily linked with Endrick and Vitor Roque on their radar. A new name, Yan Diomande, has also emerged, with the RB Leipzig player also wanted by Arsenal.",
      "Finally, we're approaching the weekend, meaning we will have all the build-up to Saturday's clash with Tottenham.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and transfer rumours involving Manchester United below.",
      "Jason Wilcox has denied that United's signing of Senne Lammens on transfer deadline day was a knee-jerk reaction to the performances of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "He told MUTV's Inside Carrington podcast:",
      "Senne, we were always looking at goalkeepers who have huge potential, and Senne was available, so we decided to move. It wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "United are said to have zero chance of signing Endrick on loan from Real Madrid.",
      "Fabrizio Romano said in his latest YouTube video:",
      "Rumours on Endrick and Manchester United, Endrick and Aston Villa, guys, zero. Zero because Endrick wants to play.",
      "Endrick doesn't want to compete; obviously, he would be ready to compete, as he's doing at Real Madrid, but he wants to play; he wants to have six months with the opportunity to play, to show his skills, to develop.",
      "Vitor Roque's agent, André Cury, claims United are not one of the European clubs that have approached them about the Palmeiras player.",
      "Cury is said to have told Globo Esporte:",
      "Today we're receiving a barrage of calls from European clubs, mainly Premier League and Italian clubs. They're calling to ask about the price and terms, but we're in the middle of the season.",
      "We already had an offer from the Arab world of 35 million euros, which wasn't of interest, and now we're going to get a proposal in the region of 50 million euros from the Premier League.",
      "Cury reportedly ruled out United being among those to approach his client. The agent added:",
      "If a good offer comes along for everyone, and they understand that he has to leave, he's open to listening, but he's very happy at Palmeiras.",
      "Man United scouts have been monitoring Hertha Berlin midfielder Kennet Eichhron, according to German outlet BILD.",
      "The 16-year-old has caught the eye from Europe's top teams with his performances in 2.Bundesliga and has been compared to Germany legend Toni Kroos.",
      "Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool and other European giants are all keen.",
      "Man United have decided they will not allow Joshua Zirkzee to leave the club in January due to the players they will miss to AFCON, according to Football Insider.",
      "Pete O'Rourke said: \"They’re going to lose Mbeumo and possibly Amad Diallo on international duty when AFCON starts in December so, that could leave them a bit short up front.",
      "“Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to really weaken his squad so Zirkzee might be needed then and he might get more game time for Manchester United while Mbuemo is away at the African Cup of Nations.",
      "“I don’t think United want to weaken their squad midway through the season as well. So they may be blocking any potential moves for Zirkzee unless they’re able to find a replacement or a deal is too good to turn down.”",
      "Globo Esporte [via SPORT] have claimed that Vitor Roque's entourage are expecting bids worth €50m for the striker in January.",
      "Man United are keen on the signing him, alongside Chelsea and West Ham United.",
      "Man United are lining-up a move for Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, United are wanting to pay £35million for the midfielder in the winter. The 22-year-old has been superb for Forest since moving from Newcastle, though Forest are expected to be tough in negotiations.",
      "Troy Deeney has accused Benjamin Sesko of being too lightweight at Manchester United. Speaking on the Football Exchange, the ex-Watford striker said: \"Benjamin Sesko looks like a baby giraffe.",
      "\"I’m looking at him; he scored two goals before the international break in back-to-back games. And I was like, ‘Okay, you’re going to have an international break and then come back full of confidence’.",
      "\"I’m not talking about scoring because strikers go through spells where they don’t score, unless you’re Erling Haaland, obviously. But for most normal people, you go through little breaks.",
      "\"But I don’t see what he does. He’s six foot four inches, honestly, I p*** stronger than him at times. He doesn’t run over people; he’s always on his heels.",
      "\"You have Cunha and Mbeumo trying to play off him. If they need him to come short, he runs in behind. If they need him to run in behind, he comes short. He’s never on the same wavelength with his team.\"",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has insisted this summer's transfer window was more organised than the previous one. Speaking to the Inside Carrington podcast for MUTV, he said: \"Last year’s summer window was a lot more chaotic than this one.",
      "\"This one was really calm, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve. These are continuous meetings between myself and Ruben [Amorim] with Chris Vivell and his team underneath.",
      "\"We are very clear on the profiles that we need. The brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris. [There is] a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We combine that with the data team and there will be constant dialogue. Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team of the profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable with Ruben as well. It is a really joined up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there is so many people involved in the process. The data team are involved and then we will focus all of our attention on certain players and it is really important that we do our background checks around whether they are clean living professionals - this is really important.\"",

      "BILD [via Sport Witness] claim United are doing so 'intensively' after attracting their interest in Austria. Leverkusen, however, sold Salzburg the winger last summer and intend to use their buyback.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly accepted they will take a huge loss on Jadon Sancho. He was loaned to Aston Villa in the summer, but has failed to make an impact at Villa Park.",
      "He is out of contract at the end of the season, but the Red Devils do have the option to extend his deal by a year. However, talkSPORT understands United are ready to allow him to walk away from the club for nothing, to bring an end to his chapter at Old Trafford.",
      "Extending his deal would give United an oppportunity to recoup a transfer fee for him. It appears the £73million man will just depart the club as a free agent once this campaign comes to a close.",
      "Former Manchester United forward Teddy Sheringham believes Arsenal's decision to sign Viktor Gyokeres was shrewder than the Red Devils' decision to buy Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There was plenty of focus paid to both players in the transfer window. While Sesko has shown some bright moments in recent weeks, Sheringham believes Gyokeres has proven to be the better purchase.",
      "Via the Mirror, he said: \"Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres were both up for transfers coming into the Premier League, and there was a question of 'Who is going to end up with which striker?'",
      "\"I would say in this moment in time, Arsenal look like they've got the better centre-forward. I'm not saying that it's going to be the end result, but I definitely think that Gyokeres has settled into Arsenal's way of playing easier than Sesko at United so far.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly more willing to loan Kobbie Mainoo, according to reports. The United academy graduate has been confined to the bench, with Ruben Amorim stating the youngster is directly competing with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The United skipper has been ever-present in the Red Devils starting eleven, reducing Mainoo to a squad player. He wanted to go out on loan last summer, but United insisted he should star at the club.",
      "Napoli have been interested in Mainoo, having already bought Scott McTominay and loaned Rasmus Hojlund from United. With Kevin De Bruyne also picking up an injury recently, they may even return for Mainoo.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping tabs on 16-year-old German prodigy Kennet Eichhorn. The teenager has already drawn comparisons with Real Madrid and Germany legend Toni Kroos.",
      "Midfield has been a target area for the Red Devils with both Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Hove Albion and Adam Wharton being strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford. However, the Hertha Berlin youngster has also appeared on United's radar, according to German outlet BILD.",
      "The Bundesliga 2's youngest ever player may even be available for as little as €20m (£17.64m). Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayer Leverkusen are also understood to be impressed by him.",
      "Manchester United are considering a move for Palmeiras striker Vitor Roque, according to reports in Brazil. O Globo claims the Red Devils are pondering making another bid for Roque, who has been compared to Luis Suarez in the past.",
      "United have previously offered £29m for the forward, who has 16 goal contributions this season, but it was rejected. It's understood Palmeiras are demanding £42m for his services.",
      "In Febraury, the Brazilian heavyweights forked out £21m to sign him from Barcelona. The Catalans hold a 20% sell-on clause, meaning the Brazilians will need a substantial sum if they are to profit.",
      "Speaking on the official Manchester United website, Wilcox said: \"It is so important. I think you have to bring players in that bring something different to the changing room.",
      "\"The most important thing is that, whenever we bring in a player, they have to want to improve and they have to be a team player, and understand what it means to be part of a successful team.",

      "\"When you talk about Cantona, when you hear anybody talk about him, he was an ultimate professional. When I look now and I see the car park, when the report time is 09:45, you see the lads coming in at 08:30, 08:45, preparing for training, and this is a good sign.",
      "\"The mood on the training pitch hasn't really changed, the intensity on the training pitch and the noise level hasn't really changed, winning or losing.",
      "\"Of course, when you lose a football match, there is a lot of disappointment and a lot of frustration but, once they are on that training pitch, the character, the team spirit, you can feel it, you can feel the energy growing and we have just got to keep it going.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is plotting to hand Shea Lacey a run in the Manchester United first team, according to reports. The 18-year-old has impressed while playing in the Red Devils' development teams.",
      "In December, the Africa Cup of Nations will begin and £71million forward Bryan Mbeumo will be representing Cameroon in Morocco. Accoding to Give Me Sport, Amorim is hugely impressed with Lacey and could turn to him to fill the void departed by Mbeumo.",
      "The Daily Mail also understands Lacey could be given his Premier League debut during thid period. As well as Mbeumo, Amad will also be in Morocco, as he will be playing for Ivory Coast.",
      "Ruud Gullit has urged Joshua Zirkzee to return to Italy.",
      "The Manchester United striker has found himself out of the starting 11 since the influx of summer additions.",
      "As a result, his place in the Holland squad for this summer's World Cup is falling under increasing scrutiny.",
      "\"I think from my point of view that he should have stayed in Italy, because he was really striving,\" he said.",
      "\"He was really doing well at Bologna and I was hoping that he would go to Milan. I think that as soon as he went to Manchester United, it was the wrong decision.",
      "\"I mean, for a lot of players, moving to Manchester United has been the wrong decision. And whoever leaves them, plays well everywhere around Europe. I just hope that there’s a solution for him.",
      "\"Go back to Italy on loan if you can. Just play football. He’s a good player. But at the moment, it’s difficult at Manchester United.",
      "\"They found a little form in the past couple of weeks and I hope for Manchester United that they continue that. Because a good Manchester United is good for the Premier League as well.\"",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has offered a rare insight into what calibre of player the club are looking for.",

      "But they face testing Forest's resolve.",
      "TalkSPORT have reported that United are willing to cut their losses and allow Jadon Sancho to leave for free.",
      "It has been said that United are resigned to losing Sancho, who still has another 18 months remaining on his deal.",
      "The England international has not played a league game since his public fallout with Erik ten Hag in August 2023 and the outlet has claimed that United are leaning towards allowing Snacho to leave rather than be 'saddled with another year of his £200,000-a-week wages'.",
      "In a report from Indy Kaila, relayed by Caught Offside, Manchester United have reportedly been given the green light to push for their top targets.",

      "Elliot Anderson caught the eye during Manchester United's draw against Nottingham Forest last weekend.",
      "Anderson is incredibly well-balanced with the ball at his feet. He skipped beyond a few United players at one stage in the first half and Ruben Amorim shook his head on the touchline.",
      "Amorim complimented Anderson just two days earlier at his pre-match press conference, mentioning him voluntarily, which piqued interest in the room considering reports linking him to Old Trafford.",
      "Anderson has established himself as a rising star since moving to Forest from Newcastle, and excelled when he made his England debut during the September international break.",
      "\"Very good. He was a bit nervous this week but then did good,\" said Thomas Tuchel following his first England appearance. The German praised Anderson again last month, describing him as \"talented\" and \"tough\".",
      "Newcastle did not want to sell Whitley Bay-born Anderson, who came through their academy, but Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) forced them into sanctioning a sale in 2024.",
      "Anderson has taken his game to another level since moving to the City Ground, benefiting from regular starts, and many have earmarked him for a bigger move in the near future.",
      "Anyone who watched United's 2-2 draw against Forest last weekend would have noticed Anderson in the centre of the pitch. He recorded 84 touches and hardly lost possession in an impressive performance.",
      "Sean Dyche said: \"I said after the Porto game he has got to learn the nuts and bolts, positionally, but he is a very good player. He deals with the ball well and has a really good attitude.",
      "\"I like him. He's got that nice nature about him. He moans a lot, but we'll get that out of him! He moans in a good way. He's a really good player. He is learning as he goes about the Premier League, positionally and the nuts and bolts of it, but he is a really good player.”",
      "Anderson is not a player who Forest would allow to leave cheaply. They fought tooth and nail to keep Morgan Gibbs-White in the summer and blockbuster owner Evangelos Marinakis personally intervened.",
      "Gibbs-White signed a new contract and Forest uploaded a video of him thanking 'Mr. Marinakis', who was standing just yards away. The jokes wrote themselves on social media.",
      "A potential fee of £70million has been touted, although the bigger question from a United perspective is whether Anderson has the profile of a midfield player they need to recruit.",
      "Anderson has been misprofiled by some pundits because he is exactly what his shirt number suggests: a No.8. He is not a traditional No.6 (defensive midfielder) and often excels in advanced areas.",
      "He is a hugely efficient distributor of the ball and can receive it under pressure, which means Anderson can sit and dictate, but he is not a midfielder who relishes defensive responsibilities.",
      "Anderson has played as a No.6 for England, but he has been capped against Andorra, Serbia, Wales and Latvia. England have been head and shoulders above those opponents and were on the front foot in each of those games, which made it easier for Anderson to play in the holding role.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He completed 121 passes against Latvia, the most on record by an England player in an away game for 17 years, but it would be a different kettle of fish playing in the deeper role for United.",
      "The priority for United at the end of the season is signing a replacement for Casemiro. And working on the assumption that Bruno Fernandes stays beyond the summer, that new signing will be the foil for the United captain, so they will have to be someone with great defensive capabilities.",
      "Anderson would not be a suitable replacement for Casemiro. He certainly has an engine to shift around the pitch and a dynamic range of passing, but he is not a natural defensive midfielder.",
      "Eddie Howe said Anderson was best from off the left and as a No.8. Speaking in November last year, Nuno Espirito Santo explained: \"Elliot has been playing in different positions. He has been wide, he has played as a second midfielder and now he is playing in the role of the 10 and he is learning.\"",
      "Tuchel has played Anderson in a deeper role for England, but the majority of his appearances for Newcastle and Forest have been in slightly different positions, and club managers know their players best.",

      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign the young defender.",
      "The 18-year-old impressed coaches at Carrington upon his arrival and was named in the pre-season tour squad. Ruben Amorim has named Leon in matchday squads against Grimsby Town, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland this season, but he has not made his senior debut.",
      "In August, there was a sense among academy staff that Leon would benefit from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches when he had been exclusively working with the first-team.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The left-back is still considered raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer arrival.",
      "Under-21 manager Travis Binnion has coached Leon over the last six weeks.",
      "Binnion was recently asked about Leon and explained: \"It is evident for all to see he has some real qualities and some strong foundations to his game that he has to build on.",
      "\"He is aware, we are all aware, he has stuff to work on but to be fair to the kid, he has not played a full 90 minutes yet. We will be looking to tick that off pretty soon and that will be really good for him.",

      "Ruben Amorim joked not even the Pope could persuade him to change his formation at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim is wedded to the 3-4-3 formation and United spent £215million on players with the skillsets to thrive in the system in the summer transfer window.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed to play in the No.10 roles. The attack was overhauled, but there was a feeling that United had made a mistake by not signing a new midfielder.",
      "United decided to go another season without a midfield recruit. That position will be the priority at the end of the season, but a new wing-back should also be at the top of the shopping list.",
      "The wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's formation. They provide width, quality in attack and defensive cover. They must have an engine to get up and down the line. It's a specialist role in the system.",
      "Amad has nailed down the right-wing back spot and delivered some excellent performances from that role throughout October, but there are question marks on the opposite side.",
      "Diogo Dalot was poor against Sunderland, despite his throw-ins being effective. He was the worst performer in the first half against Liverpool, albeit he recovered to end the game strongly. He was fine against Brighton and then took further backwards steps against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Dalot's versatility has been a selling point throughout his career. The 26-year-old is willing to play wherever he is needed, but his performances indicate he is far more comfortable when operating on the right.",
      "Following some unconvincing displays from Patrick Dorgu, Amorim has played Dalot at left wing-back in recent weeks, which was logical given his experience and the importance of the games.",
      "Dorgu was removed from the firing line after showing signs of greenness. The Denmark international is still developing his game and Amorim preferred Dalot during a run of games that he needed to win.",
      "Dalot was replaced by Dorgu in the 68th minute at the City Ground last weekend, but he might have been hooked at the interval if there had been a better option on the bench.",
      "The majority of Nottingham Forest's attacking play came down Dalot's flank and he was too passive in the build-up to Morgan Gibbs-White's goal, failing to prevent the cross into the box.",
      "It will be fascinating to see whether Dalot retains his starting role against Tottenham. He does not deserve to keep his place, but Amorim may still consider him ahead of Dorgu.",
      "Dorgu was always bound to need time and patience. United signed Dorgu for an initial €30million (£25m) from Lecce, who banked a club-record transfer fee for the 21-year-old after persistent negotiations.",
      "He arrived in the winter window and joined a struggling dressing room. \"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season,\" Dorgu said when he spoke in August.",
      "United believe Dorgu has the attributes to become a top player. \"I had interest from big teams in Italy as well, so it (United's interest) wasn’t a surprise,\" he said. \"If you're doing well, the big teams are going to look. I was surprised that they were really aggressive to get it done quickly, and I was really happy for that.\"",
      "How long Dorgu needs to reach his potential is another matter. He was a heavily data-driven signing and has the ideal physical attributes to play at left wing-back, but his final ball must improve.",
      "That's why United may need to sign a new left wing-back at the end of the season. United will know by then whether Dorgu is ready to start regularly, but it might be sensible to sign a player in that role who can hit the ground running, someone who doesn't need to improve.",
      "The wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's system and he needs the right personnel.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho's time at Manchester United was marked by his attitude and public outbursts that drew fan backlash. However, Chelsea coaches have reportedly been encouraged by the Argentine's behaviour towards training since his arrival.",
      "The 21-year-old ended his time at United in late August, completing a £40m move to Stamford Bridge. Garnacho was signed from Atletico Madrid for a nominal fee in 2020 and went on to make 144 appearances in a Reds shirt.",
      "His career at Old Trafford eventually came to an end after failing to adapt to Ruben Amorim's system. In December, he was dropped for the Manchester derby alongside Marcus Rashford, and later omitted from the Europa League finale in Bilbao.",
      "Garnacho voiced his frustration over limited minutes in a post-match interview, and he received fan criticism in June when he posted a holiday photo wearing Rashford's Aston Villa shirt. Upon returning from his holiday, the winger joined the so-called 'bomb squad' and requested his exit from Old Trafford.",
      "However, his spell under Enzo Maresca at Chelsea appears to be heading in a different direction.",
      "According to Give Me Sport, Garnacho has impressed the Blues' staff at Cobham and they have been encouraged by his 'attitude and intensity' in training. He's reportedly put in extra work to improve his decision-making in the final third and made a habit of staying behind after training to fine-tune his finishing and crossing.",
      "Coaches are said to see that dedication as a clear sign of his mentality. Sources within the camp also say that he's 'taking everything in' and remains eager to impress.",
      "Off the pitch, Garnacho is believed to be settling well into life in west London. Compatriot Enzo Fernandez has reportedly helped Garnacho settle into his new environment, with younger South American players also playing a role.",
      "The 21-year-old has started Chelsea's last four Premier League matches on the left wing and he grabbed his first goal for the club in their home defeat against Sunderland.",
      "Despite not yet playing 90 minutes and a run-in with Pedro Neto last month against Nottingham Forest - where he was hooked at half-time - Garnacho has impressed Maresca.",
      "Speaking about the Argentine and fellow summer signing Jamie Gittens, the Chelsea boss said: \"They are both adapting to our the way we work every day. They are both doing well. This is what we want from our wingers, you know, score goals and assist, and it's good to have both doing well so we can choose one or the other one.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Particularly since the arrival of Pep Guardiola on the other side of Manchester, there has been an obsession in English football with dominating possession.",
      "However, this season has seen a change in tack from Premier League coaches. The more direct approach has been welcomed back and having less of the ball is on-trend again, with Manchester United one of the teams keen to get from back to front as fast as possible.",
      "In the victory over Sunderland United had more possession, but against both Liverpool and Brighton the Reds were comfortable without the ball, particularly against the Seagulls. Ruben Amorim's side were compact and waited for the right moment to pick them off.",
      "Against Nottingham Forest, United had to change back to being the team in possession. United have been most dangerous in recent weeks when they have been in transition but in Forest they found a side that wanted to do exactly the same.",
      "Sean Dyche has built a managerial career off making teams hard to beat. His teams are often physical and do not need to have the ball to provide a threat.",
      "With the hosts happy to sit back, it was on United to have the ball and try and make things happen. Unfortunately for them, they found Forest tough to break down.",
      "The Reds were not as free-flowing when they had the ball and were only ahead at half-time thanks to a goal from a corner. In the second half, their good luck ran out.",
      "Inside five minutes Forest had the lead and United knew they needed to break them down to get anything out of the game. Amad's wonder strike saved the day but for large parts of the second half it was hard to see where the equaliser was going to come from.",
      "From that perspective, the weekend draw should be seen as a warning to the Reds.",
      "United are now a team that are happy to play on the counter and try and catch teams unaware. However, there will be more occasions to come - against the likes of Burnley, West Ham and others - where the Reds will need to be the team dominating the ball and they will have to find a new way to win those games.",
      "In those matches, United would be wise to be quicker with the ball. When they looked most threatening against Forest they were spreading play quickly through Bruno Fernandes and causing overloads, particularly through Amad and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Once the tempo slows, that is when the opposition look comfortable, so for Amorim the task must be to ensure that energy remains high. Make no mistake, the Reds' play has improved since October and undoubtedly United would have lost that game last season.",
      "But if they are to become genuine top four challengers both this season and moving forward, Amorim needs to find a way of winning matches when they are the ones setting the tempo.",

      "In 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe completed a deal to buy a 27.7 per cent stake in the club worth about $1.6billion (£1.25bn). As part of the agreement, the English businessman has taken control of football operations, with the help of Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada.",
      "Earlier this season, a takeover frenzy emerged when Turki Al-Sheikh shared a social media post claiming the Reds were in 'advanced negotiations with a new investor'. On X, Al-Sheikh wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",

      "\"Just to clarify, I'm not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "A complete takeover continues to be speculated around Old Trafford, though no concrete talks have been held. Back in April, Ed Glazer, the youngest sibling of the family, was asked about how they decide on things with the football club.",

      "\"Not every decision is six-nothing. But, ultimately, why we have been successful as a family business is that we've always kind of agreed that, if the majority of family members want to do something, we realise we are in a family business and we have to do it.",
      "\"One day it might be something that I'm in favour of. The next day, it may be something I'm not in favour. It was a family decision [the minority takeover].\"",

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has defended Benjamin Sesko after Gary Neville claimed the forward looks \"miles off it\".",
      "United completed the signing of Sesko from RB Leipzig in August in a move worth £73.7m. The Slovenia international was also a target for Newcastle United but opted to join Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "He became United's third major signing in attack following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Sesko, though, has so far failed to live up to the hype, only scoring twice in 11 games, leading to Neville coming down hard on him.",
      "“He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in, like Cunha and Mbeumo,\" he said.",
      "“He looks awkward, his touch was off a few times when balls went over the top. For £80m (£73.7m), yes, he's young and still settling, but you want to see something more.”",
      "But while Sesko has struggled, Mbeumo already has five goals to his name while Cunha has also impressed as United have transformed their fortunes in recent weeks.",
      "Wilcox, though, believes not only will Sesko come good, but his hard work is making life easier for his forwards.",
      "“Benji, at the top end, he's going to be an amazing player,” he told Inside Carrington. “It's difficult to be the no.9 at United and I know sometimes that Matheus and Bryan are getting a lot of credit, but the runs that Benji is making is also helping Matheus and Bryan as well.",
      "\"All four of them have done really well, the summer signings from last year, they are top professionals.”",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo recently claimed United’s hierarchy is still failing to take the steps needed to bring the club back to the top of the game.",
      "In an interview with Piers Morgan, the Portugal international gave another detailed take on the issues at United and explained why he believes his old club continues to struggle.",
      "But Wilcox has revealed that the club has a clear plan in place, saying: “We've just got to continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben's idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea.",
      "“It's a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for. We have got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, it is really important and we have to put the jigsaw pieces together.",
      "“Putting the jigsaw pieces together, we would love to have all of the pieces in place where we can see a very, very clear picture but, whilst we are building and whilst we are building the picture, it is even more difficult when you lose some football matches because people start questioning things.",
      "“But we are really clear, myself and Ruben, Omar [Berrada], the ownership, we are really clear on the direction of travel and this is really important.”",

      "A year ago on Saturday, Ruben Amorim was announced as the new Manchester United manager, succeeding Erik ten Hag, who left under a cloud.",
      "The United head coach wanted to take on his new role at the end of the 2024/25 season, but Ineos were insistent. It was either November or never – Amorim chose to jump on board.",
      "His first press conference at Carrington was not held until later that month. Beaming in front of the packed press conference room, Amorim set out a positive message as he looked to bring the current squad on the journey with him.",
      "\"I am a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself,\" he said back then. \"I also believe in the club, as I think we have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help. But I truly believe in the players also, I know that you guys don't believe a lot in these players, but I believe a lot and I think we have room to improve.\"",
      "Fast forward to November 2025, Amorim may not have got the perfect result, but he did get the perfect gift from one of his players in the post-match interviews. Speaking in the mixed zone to MEN Sport, Amad said something which will be music to the manager's ears.",
      "\"I think winning games always gives players confidence and now I think everyone is in a good moment as a team, we are learning every day with the manager because we believe in his system,\" Amad explained. \"But today we are really disappointed because, as a team, we didn’t win.",
      "\"Yeah, of course [we are making progress under Amorim]. At first it wasn’t easy for him and for us, but now we are trying to understand his system and we are trying to do the best every game and we want to win every game because we want to deliver with this club where they deserve to be and we are trying to do that also.\"",
      "Amad's vote of confidence for Amorim's system and way of playing will perhaps mean as much to the United boss as the backing Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave him in October. The Ivorian also believes that United are showing signs of improvement that were not there last season.",
      "\"I think now that the play is getting better and better every game,\" he added. \"When you win, you always have confidence.",
      "\"As a player, I am starting to learn this system with the manager because we are playing in a new system so we have to learn. I think we can get better every game, every day and we are training very hard and I hope we can bring this club to the next level.\"",
      "The only way that Amad and his teammates will be able to do that is by continuing to secure good results both at home and on the road. Next up is a trip to Tottenham Hotspur and the 23-year-old is under no illusions about the scale of that task.",
      "\"We will prepare the game in the week and we know Tottenham is a big team, a good team, we have to be focused until the end and try to have three points there,\" he concluded.",

      "He felt he had been pushed in the face just before the break by Ryan Yates. Cunha has previously worked with Diego Simeone and perhaps some of the Atletico Madrid boss' tricks have been taken on board to the Brazilian.",
      "United frustrations avoided",
      "The United analysts were sat in the press box during the game and for the most part you would not have noticed they were there. However, when United were losing and Benjamin Sesko passed the ball out of play, a recognisable thump of a hand hitting a desk could be heard.",
      "It was unfair on Sesko who enjoyed a good game and Amad's equaliser has perhaps saved the striker's sloppiness from being highlighted.",

      "Manchester United drew 2-2 with Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday.",
      "United opened the scoring through Casemiro in the first half, but Forest scored two goals in quick succession when play resumed after the interval to turn the game on its head.",
      "The Reds were staring defeat in the face before Amad popped up to score a breathtaking goal with nine minutes remaining, which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at the City Ground:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few important saves and was helpless for the two Forest goals, particularly the second. 6.",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "The bulk of Forest's attacking play came down the opposite side to Yoro. That is perhaps a compliment to the Frenchman. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Made a superb recovery to thwart Nicolò Savona in the first half. Should have done better for Forest's second. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Will play himself back into the England squad if he continues like this. Unfortunate to be part of a defensive unit that conceded twice. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Had two really good chances when cutting in from the right wing. Had no chance to win the header against Gibbs-White and scored a stunning goal to make it 2-2. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Opened the scoring with a brilliant header. Looked tired as the game progressed, but completed 90 minutes in the Premier League for the first time this season. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was relatively quiet in the first half until he played a lovely delivery into the box for Casemiro's goal. Hit the post in the second half and Casemiro could not convert the rebound. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "There are always question marks around Dalot when he plays on the left side and he was exposed at various stages of the contest. Amorim demanded more from him and he didn't rise to the occasion. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Playing with huge confidence and could have recorded a few assists if chances had been taken. Played a teasing ball to Benjamin Sesko in the first half but the striker did not gamble on it. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scuffed a chance in the box at the beginning of the game and dragged another shot wide after skilfully creating a yard of space for himself. Looked sharp and provided a focal point but failed to score. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Although he worked hard he wasn't at his creative best. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "An improvement on Dalot. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Provided quality at the back. 6",

      "Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett has insisted that Manchester United were fortunate not to concede a late penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men extended their unbeaten run after coming from behind to leave the City Ground with a point. After Casemiro put them ahead in the first-half, Forest went ahead through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona before Amad's strike in the 81st minute levelled the scoring.",
      "With the score still 2-1 and United pushing for a equaliser, Forest fans were left fuming when referee Darren England decided against awarding them a penalty. Ryan Yates' flick-on from a corner accidently hit Amad's arm after he mistimed his jump to head away.",
      "Despite protests from supporters and players, England opted not to point to the spot and United eventually equalised. The Premier League Match Centre account on X did not explain why the video assistant referee (VAR) decided not to intervene.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Hackett has insisted the decision was wrong, labelling the incident a \"clear handball offence\" in a post on X. It was the second controversial call that went against Forest after Sean Dyche was left furious with the way United's first goal occurred.",
      "The Forest boss was left angry that a corner was given in the build-up to Casemiro's opener. Savona looked to have kept the ball in play but the assistant on the far side flagged for a corner.",
      "“I just can’t understand it, you’re an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you’ve got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,” Dyche said.",
      "“I’ve got a better view and I’m not in the right position. That’s got to be wrong in the current climate. I’m a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.",
      "“For me, that’s five seconds of VAR: ‘Bang, that’s it, done, wrong decision.’ It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot. With all the technology and all that’s at stake, particularly for us at Nottingham Forest after the start the club has had, that’s a big moment.",
      "“We all want it right, every fan wants it right. The worst thing, I’m back in the game for three games and for two weeks on the trot I’m talking about refereeing decisions. I want to be talking about my team.”",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir would have struggled to believe his luck at the start of the Premier League campaign.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, Bayindir struggled for any minutes at all, with Andre Onana the clear first choice.",
      "After an injury picked up by Onana during the summer, Ruben Amorim chose to trust Bayindir with the gloves. The Cameroonian's poor performance at Grimsby Town, followed by his subsequent exit to Trabzonspor, appeared to have cemented Bayindir's place in the starting XI.",
      "And yet, after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, Amorim chose to give Senne Lammens his opportunity and he has not looked back. The Belgian has been impressive and the comparisons from the Stretford End to Peter Schmeichel are of course tongue in cheek but a sign of how good he has been.",
      "Bayindir is now back down the pecking order as second choice at Old Trafford and, with the World Cup coming up at the end of the season, it would be no surprise if he seeks an exit. Amorim may be reluctant to allow him to leave without a replacement lined up, but would he really stop him leaving if a decent bid was tabled?",
      "If Bayindir goes in January, it would see Tom Heaton pushed into an unexpected new role as second choice goalkeeper, should a replacement not arrive in the mid-season window.",
      "If that happens, it would be a fitting half season for Heaton, especially when he is expected to retire at the end of the campaign. The 39-year-old has had a brilliant career, and to finish up back at United as a regular in the matchday squad would be a solid achievement.",
      "If Bayindir does choose to leave, Heaton may be handed a promotion.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee “should have stayed in Italy” with the Dutchman making the “wrong decision” to join the Red Devils, according to Ruud Gullit.",
      "Zirkzee moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2024 when compatriot Erik ten Hag was still at the club after a good season for Serie A side Bologna.",
      "The Netherlands international cost Man Utd £36.5m with Zirkzee contributing six goal and two assists in 51 appearances in all competitions since joining.",
      "Only 21 of those appearances have come from the start of matches with Zirkzee being used as a substitute more often that not, especially this season.",
      "Zirkzee has played just five times this season and failed to start a match under Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim with January giving the Dutchman a chance to move on.",
      "And former Chelsea and Netherlands star Gullit insists that Zirkzee should have never joined Man Utd with the forward enjoying his time in Italy.",
      "READ: Five fascinating insights as Man Utd chief Wilcox talks Harlem Globetrotters, Sesko and Amorim",
      "Gullit told The Metro: “I think from my point of view that he should have stayed in Italy, because he was really striving.",
      "“He was really doing well at Bologna, and I was hoping that he would go to Milan. I think that as soon as he went to Manchester United, it was the wrong decision.",
      "“I mean, for a lot of players, moving to Manchester United has been the wrong decision. And whoever leaves them, plays well everywhere around Europe. I just hope that there’s a solution for him.",
      "“Go back to Italy on loan if you can. Just play football. He’s a good player. But at the moment, it’s difficult at Manchester United. They found a little form in the past couple of weeks, and I hope for Manchester United that they continue that. Because a good Manchester United is good for the Premier League as well.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Zirkzee has “not formally asked to leave” Man Utd but the Netherlands international wants more minutes before the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Romano has said on his YouTube channel: “Joshua Zirkzee has not formally asked to leave Manchester United, but he is in a similar position to Mainoo – eager for more game time ahead of the World Cup. He remains professional and fully focused in training, and Ruben Amorim is happy with his attitude.",
      "“That said, interest is building. West Ham are looking for a striker and have Zirkzee on their shortlist, while Roma in Italy are also exploring the situation. Whether he moves will depend entirely on United’s approval for a loan deal. If given the green light, England and Italy are likely destinations.”",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another player who could leave Man Utd in the January transfer window with Romano bring an update on Zirkzee’s team-mate.",
      "Romano added: “Kobbie Mainoo wanted to go on loan late in the summer transfer window, but Manchester United and Ruben Amorim decided against it at the time. Mainoo is still not playing regularly, so he remains open to a six-month loan move in January, returning to United in the summer.",
      "“The final decision will depend on Manchester United’s plans – whether they bring in another midfielder, and on Amorim’s preference to maintain his current squad. There is interest from West Ham, offering guaranteed minutes, and from Napoli, who are looking for midfield cover after Kevin De Bruyne’s injury.”",
      "Man Utd are “very unlikely” to allow wantaway duo Joshua Zirkzee or Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in January, according to the club’s ex-chief scout.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee has decided his preferred destination as he heads for a loan exit in the January transfer window, says Fabrizio Romano.",

      "Man Utd duo Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo will not be allowed to move away from Old Trafford in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached a ‘decision’ on whether to offload Kobbie Mainoo, while another star is ‘heading out in January’.",

But unless and until there’s some halfway compelling evidence of it against proper teams, he is going to face inevitable questions about the Bundesliga Tax and whether he’s quite cut out for Our League, and some of those questions will be reasonable and not just ones in ridiculous terms from ridiculous gobsh*tes like Jamie O’Hara.",

      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox has made an appearance on a new podcast series for the Red Devils’ official website called ‘Inside Carrington’.",
      "Wilcox has gone from complete silence to two interviews in a week after the tide has turned in a positive direction for Man Utd over the past month.",
      "Ruben Amorim won his first back-to-back games since arriving at Old Trafford a year ago and those two wins turned into three when they beat Brighton 4-2 late last month.",
      "A 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest at the weekend would have been a great result last season and it was important this campaign in order to keep Amorim’s unbeaten run going.",
      "Confidence is slowly building at Old Trafford with Man Utd supporters no longer looking ahead to matches with trepidation.",
      "A few good results on the bounce has already seen Wilcox pat himself on the back and now he has had a deep dive into various subjects to do with the club.",
      "Here are five of his most fascinating insights from the ‘Inside Carrington’ interview…",
      "",
      "Wilcox said: “It is not about putting the Harlem Globetrotters together. If I look at successful Man United teams, there were very functional players that would die for the badge and there were some mavericks.”",
      "On what the Red Devils are looking for, the Man Utd director of football added: “Last year’s summer window [2024] was a lot more chaotic than this one and this one was really calm. With this one, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "“These are continuous meetings with myself and Ruben [Amorim], with Chris Vivell and with his team underneath, where we are very clear on the profiles that we need. So, the brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris, there is a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles that we need, and then the scouts will go into the market, we will combine that with the data team and then there will just be constant dialogue.",
      "“Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable, with Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach. When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process. The data team are involved in the process and we will then focus all our attention on certain players.”",
      "“It is really important then that we do the background checks on whether they are clean-living professionals. This is really important. This year, we looked at Premier League-ready players and certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn’t take too much risk in this area. We needed players that we could plug in and play, with little transition time.”",
      "",
      "“Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers that have got huge potential. Senne was available and we decided to move, but it wasn’t a kneejerk reaction. Tony Coton was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it. This guy is going to be a top signing for us and he has started well, but he has got to keep it going. He is very reflective and he is very professional with his approach.”",
      "",
      "“Benji, at the top end, he’s going to be an amazing player. It’s difficult to be the no.9 at United and I know sometimes that Matheus and Bryan are getting a lot of credit, but the runs that Benji is making is also helping Matheus and Bryan as well.",
      "“All four of them have done really well, the summer signings from last year, they are top professionals.”",
      "",
      "“We’ve just got to continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben’s idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea. It’s a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for. We have got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, it is really important and we have to put the jigsaw pieces together.",
      "“Putting the jigsaw pieces together, we would love to have all of the pieces in place where we can see a very, very clear picture but, whilst we are building and whilst we are building the picture, it is even more difficult when you lose some football matches because people start questioning things. But we are really clear, myself and Ruben, Omar [Berrada], the ownership, we are really clear on the direction of travel and this is really important.”",
      "",
      "“All we are doing now is making sure that we make decisions for the football club and not for the benefit, not for the short-term protection of ourselves, we’re making some really bold decisions for the future of Man United.",
      "“Man United is bigger than any player, any manager, any staff member. We are custodians, if you like, and we’ve just got to understand that at some point our journey will end, inevitably.",
      "“We need to make sure that when we leave this football club, whenever that is, and I hope I am here for a long, long time, that this football club is in a much better position.”",
      "Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has not minced his words on his former club and Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Wolves getting rid of Vitor Pereira leaves two joint-favourites in the Sack Race, though one manager is surely the most likely to go next…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should now be aiming for a top-four finish in the Premier League after their recent run of form, according to Lee Sharpe.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist."

      "“But I still don’t think they’ll be open to losing him mid-way through the season because as an option either off the bench or for rotation, he’s very important.",
      "“The same goes for Zirkzee, he’s been sidelined for a while, but he’s still the type of player you’d want in your squad even if he’s not playing every game.",
      "“Whether he’s happy with that, I’m not sure, but from the manager’s point of view he wants to keep him around because he’s a good depth option.",
      "“You never know if you’re going to pick up a couple of injuries or something like that, and all of a sudden these are the players you need to be calling on.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are intensifying their pursuit of Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, viewing him as a prime and realistic target for the January transfer window, and TEAMtalk can reveal an offer is being prepped.",
      "Sources close to Man Utd indicate that the Red Devils are confident of securing a deal, despite Forest’s firm stance on demanding a substantial fee.",
      "Anderson, the 22-year-old England star who joined Forest from Newcastle United in a £35million deal last summer, has quickly established himself as a key player at the City Ground.",
      "His energetic displays in midfield have caught the eye of United’s boss, Ruben Amorim, who sources say is desperate to inject more dynamism and legs into his engine room.",
      "With the team getting better but struggling for consistency in the Premier League, Amorim sees Anderson’s relentless work rate, pressing ability, and box-to-box stamina as the perfect fit for his high-intensity system.",
      "Another key attribute wooing higher-ups at Man Utd is Anderson’s ability to break the lines with his pinpoint passing.",
      "Such a trait meshes well with Amorim’s attacking philosophy which prioritises faster-paced attacks over more measured and deliberate build-ups.",
      "United’s belief in landing Anderson stems from multiple factors.",
      "Club insiders reveal that the player himself would be “very keen” on a move to Old Trafford, attracted by the opportunity to compete at the highest level and the chance to immerse himself in the prestige of a ‘big six’ club.",
      "This mutual interest could prove pivotal in negotiations, especially as United scout the market for affordable reinforcements amid financial fair play constraints.",
      "However, Nottingham Forest have drawn a clear line in the sand: pay big money or back off.",
      "Forest are under no pressure to sell and value Anderson highly after his seamless integration.",
      "As such, we understand Forest are setting their stall out around the £80m mark, though United believe a deal can be struck for closer to £60m.",
      "Anderson’s contributions have been perhaps the brightest spark at the City Ground this term in what has otherwise been a season of doom and gloom for the 19th-placed side so far.",
      "Forest are well aware losing Anderson would have a detrimental effect on their ability to stave off relegation, thus ensuring they’ll put up stiff resistance if Man Utd do act on their interest and thunder in with a significant bid.",
      "Amorim’s tactical blueprint demands midfielders who can cover ground relentlessly, and Anderson’s profile aligns perfectly.",
      "Amorim operates with a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro the most selected midfield pairing in between the wing-backs this season.",
      "Given the wing-backs are tasked with controlling an entire flank by themselves, United’s two-man midfield can often be exposed against teams who deploy three in the middle. This is just one of the reasons why a relentless engine is such a valued trait for Amorim when the Portuguese signs midfielders.",
      "United’s hierarchy shares Amorim’s adoration of the player, along with his optimism a deal CAN be made in the winter window.",
      "Accordingly, sources state the club are prepared to test Forest’s resolve with a structured offer that would total a figure around £60m.",
      "As the January window approaches, this saga could define United’s mid-season revival. Will Forest hold firm, or will Anderson’s ambition propel him to Manchester? The coming weeks will tell.",
      "In other news, TEAMtalk can reveal the primary reason why United have abandoned their attempts to sign Endrick on loan in January.",
      "Elsewhere, Man Utd have been savaged for offloading a player who is now ‘unstoppable’.",
      "Finally, a report has detailed the ‘dilemma’ Ruben Amorim faces with a Man Utd star he can’t live with but can’t live without.",

      "Ronaldo had two spells at Man Utd as a player, with it fair to say that his first stint at Old Trafford was far more successful than his second.",
      "The five-time Ballon d’Or winner butted heads with Erik ten Hag before leaving the Red Devils, with the Dutchman rightly preferring to select United’s younger stars at the beginning of the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Naturally, Ronaldo did not respond well to this treatment and spat his dummy out en route to having his contract terminated by mutual consent, with the 40-year-old hitting out at Ten Hag, the Glazer family and club legend in a now-infamous interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "Since leaving, Man Utd have continued to flounder as they have struggled under Amorim before their recent upturn, while Ronaldo has spent the last couple of years in the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr.",
      "Now. Ronaldo has had another interview with Morgan and has hit out at Man Utd again.",
      "He has revealed his thoughts on the “sad” situation at Man Utd, claiming Amorim is “doing his best” and cannot “do miracles”.",

      "When asked about his relationship with his former club, Ronaldo responded: “I was there for so many years. I won the Champions League, the Golden Ball, I won like, 12, 13 or 14 trophies there. Manchester United are still in my heart.",
      "“I love that club. But we have to all be honest and say they are not on a good path. They need to change. And it’s not only about the coach and the players, in my opinion.",
      "“[Ruben Amorim is] doing his best. [He’s] not going to do miracles. This is impossible.",
      "“Manchester United have good players but some of them don’t have the mind, what Manchester United is.”",

      "“Soon. But I think I will be prepared,” Ronaldo said on retirement.",
      "“It will be tough, of course. It will be difficult? Yes. Probably (I) will cry, yes… I’m (an) open person. (It) will be very, very difficult, yes.",

      "The 22-year-old has scored just two goals in 11 matches in all competitions since moving to Man Utd and has faced criticism in recent weeks.",
      "Gary Neville insisted that Sesko looked “awkward” as Man Utd drew 2-2 against Nottingham Forest at the weekend and insists the “jury is out” on the striker still.",
      "Neville said: “I’m no further forward with him. The jury is out.",

      "“He looks awkward, he had a couple of really good opportunities in the first half when balls got played over the top and his touch wasn’t quite right.",
      "“For 80 million pound, you can say he’s young, has a lot of potential and is only just settling in, but you still want to see a bit more.”",
      "But former Liverpool midfielder Hamann insists that Sesko and Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade have been more impressive this season than Arsenal striker Gyokeres, who has scored six goals in 13 matches so far.",
      "When asked which player out of Sesko, Gyokeres and Woltemade will score the most goals this season, Hamann told footballblog.co.uk: ‘I think the club that will be creating the most chances will be Arsenal, and so that probably puts Gyokeres ahead of the other two, Woltemade and Sesko.",
      "“Of the three players, I think that Sesko and Woltemade have impressed me more than Gyokeres.",
      "“If Woltemade is the regular penalty taker for Newcastle from now until the end of the season, then I think I will put Woltemade down as the player to score the most out of those three this season.",
      "“I think Sesko found it hard at first because it’s a different game in England compared to Germany. But he’s a very talented player.",
      "“He was always very confident and he’s got a lot of belief in his ability. But then when you come to a club where things are not great, it’s difficult for a striker.",
      "“Confidence is a big thing, and poor morale at a club doesn’t help. I think he’s done okay so far, but we certainly haven’t seen the best yet because he’s an exceptional talent.",
      "“People in Salzburg said at 16, 17, when he came to the club, he was better than Erling Haaland. Obviously that’s not the case at the moment, but I think potentially he could be a player who scores 20, 25 goals every season.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Unlikely. Kylian Mbappe is 14 ahead of the Arsenal man.",

      "We’re worried, okay? We’re worried that we might be about to embark upon the dreariest and dullest interlull of all time.",
      "It is, frankly, a perfect storm of interlull dullness, as you can see from our quick Interlull Dullness Survey here.",
      "Is it the November international break, the third in quick succession and thus by definition always the hardest to drag yourself through? Yes.",
      "Are England’s games entirely meaningless? You bet your Anglo-centric arse and anus England’s games are entirely meaningless.",
      "Are any big clubs currently in the very deepest depths of crisis and/or plausibly about to sack their manager? They are not.",
      "Have the press already gleefully signalled their intention to make this The Bellingham Interlull at all costs and in all circumstances no matter what happens? Yes, with massive great knobs on.",
      "It’s going to be just awful. There is probably nothing that can be done to save it or us, but here are five things that we desperately now want to happen over the days ahead in the forlorn hope it might at least mitigate the barrenness of the wasteland stretching out before us.",
      "",
      "Famously something that Tottenham don’t really do anymore, their four wins against Manchester United last season even going so far as the truly absurd lengths of delivering a trophy to N17, but a lot has changed in the weeks and months since That Night in Bilbao.",
      "Man United’s recovery from deepest and darkest crisis still hasn’t been enough to get that lad a haircut after the 2-2 draw at Forest, but it’s still delivered 10 points in four games and that will very much do. And Liverpool’s win over Villa last week has taken the edge off slightly at Anfield.",
      "It’s going to be hard to concoct a full crisis for any of the Big Six now, but our best bet might be Thomas Frank over at Spurs after the most small-time ‘big club’ home performance in living memory against Chelsea. The initial plan appeared to be to play for a goalless draw and then, when that didn’t work out, play for a 1-0 defeat. It’s a mad plan for Spurs at home to absolutely anyone, but especially a Chelsea side that absolutely isn’t all that having lost to Sunderland the previous weekend and then nearly contrived all sorts of unpleasantness at desperate Wolves in the Carabao.",
      "Frank absolutely needs a result and a performance against United to silence some of the increasingly loud doubts and also at least start to turn around that laughably poor home form, albeit only some of which – but an inevitably increasing amount – has come on his watch.",
      "Lose to United for the first time in over three years, and Spurs will drop back into mid-table where, frankly, their performances deserve to have them. Do it in anything like a repeat of the drab, ambition-free nature of the Chelsea defeat and suddenly there’s a story to fill the void and an awkward couple of weeks for Frank before the blessed relief of another away game. Which is at Arsenal. Oof.",
      "",
      "Not sure City can be plunged easily back into crisis, but we’re damn sure Liverpool can. Nothing about the way a team that has conceded 14 goals already in the Premier League this season has gone about their defending suggests they are in any way ready to cope with Erling Haaland in his current preposterous pomp, so there really is every chance for a silly high-scoring game here that does much to sustain us through the days and nights that follow.",
      "Is a wild 5-3 in the last Premier League game for 13 days really too much to ask? We say no. No it is not. More defensive calamity. More Virgil van Dijk looking daggers at Milos Kerkez and wondering how it’s all come to this. More Haaland doing the robot.",
      "While we’re being greedy, we’ll take a Salah hat-trick at the other end as well, please. We just want a Super Sunday headliner that legitimately has enough going on to fill the next three days’ discourse. We won’t ask for anything ever again. Not until March anyway.",
      "We will grudgingly accept the reverse outcome – as we would with Spurs-United, to be fair – if it’s large and compelling and above all funny enough. But it really does feel like Spurs and Liverpool are our best crisis bets this weekend, the sheer futility of trying to predict what Chelsea might get up to having now been firmly established.",
      "READ: Arsenal top, Wolves bottom, Liverpool being sh*t and other inevitable things we should have seen coming",
      "",
      "Perhaps the greediest and unlikeliest request of the lot, but the less ridiculously we are able to spend the interlull kidding ourselves on that there might still be a title race, the better.",
      "It’s another factor, really, in why City beating Liverpool is better than the other way round, because City are currently that precious one point closer to the runaway leaders, which means any result other than a City win just means that Arsenal lead getting bigger again.",
      "Unless, and hear us out because it is technically possible, Arsenal don’t beat Sunderland. These lads are fourth in the league, after all. We really shouldn’t just be assuming Arsenal definitely beat them, even though assuming Arsenal definitely beat pretty much anyone feels entirely fair at this point what with the twin superpowers of never facing any shots on their own goal and always scoring at least one p*ss-boiling set-piece at the other.",
      "But maybe the chaotic and unexpected energy of Sunderland is just the thing to derail the serene Mikel Arteta machine. And for our own something-to-fill-the-void requirements, the greater the prominence of Granit Xhaka in any such spanner-in-the-works behaviour the better.",
      "",
      "The fixture computer has deigned in her infinite wisdom and great mischievous magnificence to grant us not just two Big Six encounters upon this sacred final weekend before another bastard break, but also at least two relegation six-pointers. We thank her and make offerings to her glory.",
      "You can chuck in Everton v Fulham if you want to make mischief, but it’s unlikely that anything there can really shift the needle enough. The big ones are West Ham v Burnley on Saturday afternoon, and Nottingham Forest v Leeds on Sunday.",
      "We don’t care who steps up to heroically take the fall, we just need one of you four to get absolutely battered to keep the Sack Race nice and lively for the next 10 days. Please and thank you.",
      "",
      "We’ve thought long and hard about this one. In truth, there is absolutely no universe now where this international break isn’t Bellingham Week. No timeline where Mediawatch isn’t sighing and repeating itself from the last international break, which was literally five f*cking minutes ago.",
      "There’s no avoiding it, all we can hope to do is to mitigate the extent of the nonsense. And we reckon the best chance is if Tuchel does pick him this time.",
      "Because if Bellingham is in the squad, at least the Bellingham Week stories that follow will have to make some kind of superficial nod to real-world events that actually happen rather than the press pack having completely free rein to just make up the narrative.",
      "Which brings us to the further mitigating requirements required here to try and damp down the crazy. First, Bellingham will need to play some part in the games and be quite good but not too good. If he’s conspicuously good or conspicuously bad, it’s all too easy for it to naturally become the dominant narrative anyway. Bellingham isn’t really a footballer who does ‘quietly effective’ but we are really going to need him to try.",
      "And if that can happen with the barest minimum of any accompanying behaviour that can be spun as Billy Big Bollocks antics, again it would really help.",
      "Obviously, there’s no actual proper solution here. Anything he does (or doesn’t do) will still constitute a display of true colours or the speaking of volumes but the more egregiously the media has to reach for it the better. Don’t be giving them any ammunition.",
      "Liverpool are already making progress on arguably the most important deal they’ll complete in 2026.",
      "Do Chelsea actually have only five good players? And definitely not a good manager. These are tricky times for Chelsea fans.",
      "Micky van de Ven’s solo goal against Copenhagen was staggeringly good. For Spurs, it might prove to have been just a bit too good.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of four defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having a top No.6.",
      "We’re not swayed by a decent hour against Copenhagen. Xavi Simons is still on this list of big summer signings who might just be a bit sh*t.",
      "Joao Palhinha has a shout to be the signing of the summer so far, making Jamie Carragher’s MNF criticism seem even more bizarre."

      "Neville told The Overlap and Betfair’s Stick to Cricket show: “I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man United, our spine was (Peter) Schmeichel, (Steve) Bruce, (Gary) Pallister, (Roy) Keane and (Eric) Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",

      "“Up front, they haven’t got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "“That’s why I think Liverpool are good because they’ve got Alisson, (Virgil) van Dijk, they’ve got (Alexis) Mac Allister and (Ryan) Gravenberch in midfield and then they’ve got obviously the centre-forwards that they’ve got.”",
      "A report came out in The Athletic which claimed Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi were the two prime candidates, alongside Amorim, to take over at Old Trafford before the Portuguese head coach was appointed.",
      "When asked for his thoughts on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand said: “Who cares?",
      "“We’re in the moment where Amorim is starting to find a bit of positivity, and then we’re writing about someone who could have or should have taken the job over a year ago.",

      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 19 Premier League games, and just one from five very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raises the stakes. Feels like a really big week for Frank now with key home games in Europe and the Premier League to come before the interlull.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, and he’ll have been enormously grateful Spurs were so thoroughly wretched on Saturday evening.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table after 10 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis reached full-blown levels before Saturday’s much-needed win over Aston Villa, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It was six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competitions before they stopped the rot against Villa. It was a result that really was sorely needed to prevent the genuine possibility of something truly extraordinary happening to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season.",
      "",
      "That was a very, very good time to face Wolves, and Marco Silva took full advantage to end a losing run that was just beginning to tip him and Fulham towards trouble. We remain convinced of this: Fulham and Silva are both better off with each other than without, and both parties would do well to pause before thinking of doing anything rash.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re only just at one-quarter distance this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s miserable trio managed.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed despite a decent point against resurgent Manchester United.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, he desperately needed a statement performance and result to suggest he might be in possession of possible solutions. The win against Newcastle provided exactly that and surely buys him some time at least.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover.",

      "The 2025 summer transfer window was fun and all, but teams are using the opportunity to pre-arrange transfers years in advance now to steal a march on their rivals.",
      "Chelsea are chief among them but plenty of other sides are indulging in the practice. These are the upcoming transfers sorted for future windows involving Premier League clubs.",
      "",
      "Tottenham really are going to have some team a few managers from now. Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall became grey-haired, grizzled veterans after pulling through an injury crisis for Ange Postecoglou, and they will soon be showing the likes of Melia the ropes for Thomas Frank’s successor.",
      "They will have to wait a little while for Melia, whose move as the League of Ireland’s record sale cannot be officially ratified until he turns 18 because Brexit. That’s so long, in fact, that said Irish transfer record has already been broken again.",
      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",
      "",
      "Manchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",

      "“I can’t even believe you will be playing at sort of that level with pressure on you at 15,” said Gary Neville, who also implored the world to “definitely just let him breathe, let him enjoy himself” and not “put too much pressure on him”.",
      "Sullivan signed the richest homegrown contract in MLS history at just 14, contained within which is a clause tying him to a pre-arranged transfer to Manchester City when he turns a positively ancient 18.",
      "The midfielder has built quite the reputation on the youth scene at club and international level, attracting interest from Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.",
      "But Sullivan himself cited the lure of signing for Union, with whom he has familial ties, with an in-built pathway to Europe when he has been given time and patience to develop.",

      "Still only 20, Roque ‘prioritises finishing his contract with Palmeiras until June and would then be more open to a new adventure as long as there is a financial agreement between the parties’.",

      "And transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that there are currently no talks over signing Gallagher but Man Utd continue to monitor ahead of a potential loan move.",
      "Romano told GiveMeSport: “There’s no negotiation now. Gallagher remains one of the players monitored by Man United, as he was on the shortlist at the end of August. It will depend on what Atletico want to do, as they weren’t open to a loan move in August.”",
      "Earlier this week, Romano gave an update on what Man Utd fans can expect from their club ahead of the January transfer window.",

      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Man Utd are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Romano added: “But Amorim sends a clear message also in public talking about January. First of all, he says the window will be open and there is the possibility they will do something. So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",
      "“They already have several players. So, if someone joins in January, it will be a player who Man Utd can trust for the present but also for the future.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have submitted an ‘offer’ as they look to sign a former Barcelona star, while they are also eyeing Vinicius Junior."

      "Leeds only have one player in an XI of the biggest signings made by promoted Premier League clubs, with ample opportunity for them to take more spaces."

      "Premier League • England",
      "Reports on the continent claim Liverpool are planning to spend a further £202m on three new signings in the January window to complete the rebuild of Arne Slot’s side – but TEAMtalk can explain why only one of the trio touted to sign is a realistic target.",
      "The Reds lavished some £440m (€505m, $600m) on rebuilding their squad over the summer, though several stars also left in a summer of sweeping changes for the Premier League champions. As is typical, though, for a side undergoing a serious transformation, Liverpool have taken time to find their best form and already find themselves some seven points adrift of table-topping Arsenal.",
      "But with the team still dogged by inconsistencies and having recently suffered six losses in seven games, Slot knows his side is far from perfect and still has many improvements to make if they are to challenge for major honours this season.",
      "To that end, notorious Spanish website Fichajes claims the Reds want to splash out another €230m (£202m, $265m) on stars from Real Madrid, Inter Milan and PSG, all in their sights.",
      "Per the report, the Reds are  ‘prepared to offer close to €60 million’ for Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "The France international is not the only midfielder on their agenda, either, with the report detailing interest in splashing out a further €90m on PSG midfielder Vitinha, who recently came third in the Ballon d’Or voting.",
      "‘Liverpool believes Vitinha could be the ideal addition to control the midfield. His price tag is around €90 million, a high figure but manageable within the club’s financial plan. His arrival would bring creativity, attacking prowess, and a high level of technical ability, precisely what the Anfield side is looking for to take a decisive step forward,’ the report claims.",
      "And to complete their winter window bonanza, it’s reported Liverpool see Alessandro Bastoni as the ‘ideal heir’ to Virgil van Dijk.",
      "The report continues: ‘The defence is also a focus of attention and the chosen player to reinforce it is Alessandro Bastoni, currently with Inter Milan and one of the most promising centre-backs in Europe.",
      "‘At just 25 years old, Bastoni combines power, tactical intelligence, and excellent ball distribution. Liverpool FC see him as the natural successor to Virgil van Dijk and are prepared to offer around €80 million to secure his services.’",
      "DON’T MISS 👉 Seven players hoping to catch the eye in Liverpool v Real Madrid amid transfer subplots",
      "Given Liverpool have just embarked on a major summer rebuild, it would seem madness to suggest they could splash out another £200m-plus on more new additions.",
      "And while their summer net spend was actually £218m, thanks to sales worth over £220m, it’s hard to take the report seriously given what Slot has said about further additions to his squad and his admission that money would only be splashed out if injuries were to dictate.",
      "Liverpool have lost one summer signing, Giovani Leoni, to a season-ending ACL injury, but speaking ahead of the 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace, Slot stated when asked if he could spend again: “That all depends on whether we get more injuries, yes or no, and if there’s a chance in the market – all the answers I always give.",
      "“But I would not prefer to go to 24/25 players. Also, if it is ever a situation where I lead a team that has four or five injuries throughout the whole season, it might be a bit smarter to go to 24/25, but recent history has shown that [we have a good record] until now.",
      "“We don’t have five or six injuries at the same time throughout the whole season. If that were the situation, then we would end up with 15/16 players, and that would normally be difficult.",
      "“So it’s a choice I like to make, but I think it is also a financial choice that we as a club have to make. If we want to keep these top players, we cannot have 24/25 of them.”",
      "Yet of those three, it is perhaps the injury to Leoni and uncertainty around the future of Ibrahima Konate that makes a possible move for Bastoni an intriguing prospect.",
      "The 40-times capped Italy defender has racked up 270 appearances for Inter and is now regarded as one of the best centre-halves, not just in Italy, but in world football.",
      "And he certainly has the type of credentials and qualities Liverpool would be after to improve their squad; indeed, he’s one of the few players in world football who could viably be seen as a suitable heir to Van Dijk.",
      "But whether Inter would sanction a mid-season sale would appear unlikely, especially given his fellow defenders Stefan de Vrij, 33, Francesco Acerbi, 37, and Matteo Darmian, 36, all having contracts expiring at the end of this season.",
      "To dismiss Fichajes’ other links, however, Liverpool do not need to add new midfielders to their mix with Slot blessed with a plethora of options.",
      "And while Vitinha, certainly, would be a significant upgrade on Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones, and, potentially, Ryan Gravenberch too, persuading PSG to part with one of their crown jewels is simply a non-starter.",
      "Meanwhile, Konate has sent a 12-word message to Liverpool fans ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League showdown with Real Madrid in a game being billed as the Frenchman’s transfer audition – but new reports in Spain suggest his poor form for the Reds has seen the Spanish giants accelerate moves for two other targets instead.",
      "Elsewhere, speculation is rife that Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has no intention of playing Liverpool loanee Harvey Elliott again, to avoid triggering a conditional obligation to buy clause.",
      "Finally, sources have addressed claims that Liverpool are starting to regret signing Milos Kerkez in the summer after the Hungarian’s early struggles to find his feet at Anfield, with our transfer correspondent, Dean Jones, revealing what the Reds’ future plans in the transfer market with regards their full-back department."

But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee “should have stayed in Italy” with the Dutchman making the “wrong decision” to join the Red Devils, according to Ruud Gullit.",

Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",

To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester in which Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison were the scorers, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the Raphinha and Rodrigo-inspired loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds…",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",

      "No keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 84.2%, perhaps because Arsenal just don’t give up chances of any reasonable quality. The Spaniard has faced only one shot on target in the last four games.",

Conceding direct from a corner against Bournemouth and then from around 30 yards didn’t help his cause. Little Sels could do about either of Manchester United’s goals but Big John is still breathing down his neck.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",

      "Dermot Gallagher reveals all as he examines incidents from across the weekend, including Amad's late equaliser at Nottingham Forest, Onana and Mac Allister's penalty box incident, Donnarumma's complaints after Bournemouth hit back and Bentancur's challenge on James",
      "Monday 3 November 2025 11:37, UK",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher is back with the latest Ref Watch after a busy weekend of incidents, including Manchester United's dubious goal from a corner at Nottingham Forest.",
      "INCIDENT: Man Utd's first goal comes after a dubious corner is awarded. Corner complaints for Forest for the second week running - why won't VAR intervene for corners?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Why has the referee made that judgment? I don't know, because if the ball does go out and he doesn't see it, I can understand that, because he has got two goal posts there.",
      "\"He's got a goalkeeper, he's got [Nicolo] Savona himself in front of him, but he's made a judgment from 75 - 80 yards, incorrectly. You know, he's probably thought it's gone out, but it hasn't.",
      "\"The referee, I feel for as that depth, you're not going to see. If it hit the line like that, you wouldn't give a goal.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"The ball's definitely not gone out, and the fact that the linesman has made a judgment call from about, what, 70 yards. The referee was closer. I know he's a bit of a different angle, but the referee was definitely closer.",
      "\"It's just too far to say. But again, this is twice in two weeks now and I'm thinking to myself, well, there's goal line technology.",
      "\"Maybe that can be used across the whole byline, but then obviously, they can't change the rules this year, but it's definitely something they need to look at for next year, because it will cost teams ultimately.",
      "\"I think you can look at that in 10 seconds, and it will be cleared up and there will be no debate. They have enough time to look at that and make a decision.\"",
      "INCIDENT: The ball strikes Patrick Dorgu on the arm in the build-up to Amad's equaliser at Forest, but the goal stands.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It strikes his arm on the way through, but the rule is, has he scored? No, so he is not penalised for that.",
      "\"Is it deliberate? No, it brushes his arm on the way through, so it is not a deliberate play, so the game goes on, it gets cleared and he shoots.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Amadou Onana grabs Alexis Mac Allister by the throat in the penalty area while attacking a corner - why just a yellow?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The fact they were pushing and shoving each other and all right, he's raised his arm, probably a bit higher than he wanted, but he's pushing.",
      "\"Stuart's got to decide, is it violent? Is it an act of brutality? He said: 'No,' he's obviously relayed to the VAR what he's seen, VAR has checked it back. The referee said, yellow card only.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"As much as I like a physical game, I look at this situation, I'm like, if someone puts their hand on my throat in the street like that, you're gonna get an aggressive reaction from me.",
      "\"So in that instance, I'm saying that should be a red card, because obviously Mac Allister can't do that, right? Mac Allister has made the most of it. He's gone down, right? And that's probably because if he reacts, he'll get a red card too.",
      "\"So I think he's gone down there, and obviously, it's something that the official should have picked up.",
      "\"But I look at that and I say that is aggressive, because again, I reiterate, if that happens off the football pitch and someone does that to you, you're going to react in a certain way, which probably be aggressive, or you're going to call HR!\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gianluigi Donnarumma complained he was held by David Brooks as Bournemouth netted an equaliser from a corner at Man City.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I thought it was a goal. I've seen refs take a much different approach. It's not a good punch. I don't think the forward does much wrong.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If you look at Donnarumma, it looks like it's not affecting him that much.",
      "\"When you look at all the players in the box, they're all nudging each other. There is contact. There is, you know, how many people are in the box? There are 20 players in there, so I don't understand why keepers want more protection.",
      "\"He's six foot seven, and his span upwards would probably be about nine feet. I don't understand why he's complaining there.",
      "\"He's complaining because he's punched that, but it's a bad punch and a goal has come of it. It's definitely not a foul. And I think keepers, again, I feel like they get too much protection, and in that scenario, for the referee, fantastic decision.",
      "\"He should be commanding that area more. The only person I've seen say it was a foul is Guardiola. What are we saying now? It's a non-contact sport.",
      "\"Brooks has definitely not fouled him. The referees have been consistent about this, and I think it's been good.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Rodrigo Bentancur avoids red for a tough challenge on Reece James.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think this is one of them. If he gets sent off, VAR is not bringing him back. I think it's more red than a yellow card.",
      "\"But I can understand the yellow on field. I think VAR is going to back the decision.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If he does get a red card there, I say, I understand why he got it, but then after that, I can understand as well why it's a yellow card. It's an aggressive challenge. It's one of those orange card challenges.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez is only shown a yellow card despite a studs-up high challenge on Spurs midfielder Joao Palhinha.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I definitely do not think this is a red card, his feet are up and it is a glancing blow, he has not gone through him, it is almost sideways. If he was in front and had gone through like that, he is in big trouble, but because of the angle he comes in at, he does not get the force or contact and so does not make the impact.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"I really like this decision from the ref. Enzo has tried to make an honest challenge there and just toe the ball away and as he has toe the ball away, his foot is obviously up, but his foot has hit the side of Palhinha's knee, so in that instance, it is not a reckless tackle, or a high challenge. From certain angles and a high speed, it looks a red.\"",
      "INCIDENT: West Ham have a penalty overturned by the VAR after it was deemed Malick Thiaw had got a touch on the ball first in his challenge with Jarrod Bowen.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Yes [right decision made], but I will also say when I first saw it I thought penalty, so I can understand why the referee [Robert Jones] first gave a penalty. When I saw the first replay, I knew it would be overturned.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"He has not touched the ball enough, the ball has not even changed speed, it is so minute that it should be given as a penalty, it is a crazy decision.",
      "\"You cannot say every time that you touch the ball it is not a penalty. He blocked Bowen from getting to the ball, so it is a penalty!\"",
      "The decision took over three minutes - was that too long?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It was quite protracted and that is why I do not want to see more intrusion [by the VAR], it can be slicker.\"",

      "There has been so much noise around Viktor Gyokeres this season.",
      "Is he good enough? Is he scoring enough? Is he doing enough?",
      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",
      "Gyokeres struck the opener from a corner as Mikel Arteta's side also improved on their league-leading set-piece goals tally before the striker's brilliant pass freed Leandro Trossard in the build up to Declan Rice's superb header.",
      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",
      "Gyokeres' injury will now be the concern for Arsenal - as will concerns over Martin Zubimendi, who was replaced in the second half.",
      "With Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Jesus still out after long-term injuries, the Gunners can't afford to lose much more quality, especially in the centre-forward position.Oliver Yew",
      "Sometimes this job is a real privilege. Watching Moises Caicedo up close was a real thrill - even the Tottenham fans would have to agree. This was a performance that showcased everything you want from a world-class midfielder. Tenacious, intelligent, full of quality and affecting the game in the final third. Jamie Redknapp called him \"world class, perhaps the best of his type in world football.\"",
      "It's hard to argue.",
      "The £115m price tag had seemed to hang around his neck like a glittering weight in his early days at Chelsea but we're now seeing the player that bulldozed opposition players at Brighton.",
      "There's something N'Golo Kanté-esque about him, not just in engine or energy, but in humility. He doesn't crave the spotlight, he craves the ball. And when he gets it, the whole game dances to his tune. Xavi Simons looked almost frightened at times to dribble near the Chelsea enforcer such was the domination in the duels.",
      "He has that fear factor now. And that's one of the main reasons why he's the best in the world at what he does.Lewis Jones",
      "To beat Tottenham looks simple at the moment: defend set pieces properly and you're onto a winner. Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",
      "For his and Wolves' sake, let's hope he finds it soon…Rich Morgan",
      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end.Adam Bate",

      "United had led at half-time through a controversial Casemiro opener which sparked fury around the City Ground. The officials had awarded a corner when replays did not conclusively show all of the ball had crossed the line and the Brazilian subsequently headed in.",
      "\"It's not out,\" said former Premier League referee Mike Dean on Soccer Saturday. \"The ball is nowhere near out. It's just a guess by the referee.\"",
      "Forest had conceded from a corner which should have been given as a goal-kick at Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Afterwards, Forest boss Sean Dyche called for a review of the rules, with VAR currently unable to intervene in those situations. \"We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR,\" he said. \"Why's it not brought in?",
      "\"Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",
      "Forest were fuelled by the injustice on Saturday, with Morgan Gibbs-White brilliantly heading in an equaliser three minutes into the second half before Nicolo Savona - who had been the player judged unable to keep the ball in for the controversial corner - pounced to prod in Forest's second.",
      "Nottingham Forest: Sels (6), Savona (7), Milenkovic (6), Murillo (8), Williams (7), Luiz (6), Anderson (8), Ndoye (6), Gibbs-White (8), Hudson-Odoi (7), Igor Jesus (6).\n\n\nSubs:  Yates (7), Awoniyi (6), Sangare (N/A)\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (7), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (7), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Mazraoui (6)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest)",
      "Bruno Fernandes drilled a low shot against an upright as United sought to swing the contest again but Forest weren't far off a third, with Igor Jesus heading wide from close range and Callum Hudson-Odoi blasting narrowly off target.",
      "Amad's firecracker left Forest ruing those misses and in the end they were indebted to Murillo's quick reactions.",
      "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche:",
      "\"It's not conclusive. I've seen it back. Apparently today, the assistant referee can see 78 yards away. It's got to change. That's two in a week. Two decisions that are not right have gone against us in a week. Yes, of course, we then have to deal with the situation which we didn't do as well. But it is tough when there's a lot of noise about corners at this club and then they give corners that aren't corners.",
      "\"We had one last week, one this week. It's very tough on the team to take decisions like that. We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR, why it is not brought in? Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"I think we dropped the energy level. You can feel it when our team is not at the top of their energy and aggression. You can feel it. We managed to score again, we tried to win the game, we had a big opportunity in the end. We missed that little bit of luck. We need to work to bring the same away from home as we do in our stadium.",
      "\"We are getting better. Everyone can see. We are getting that feeling that if we can't win, at least we aren't going to lose. The way we press, the urgency with certain things, I think we did better last Sunday. We need to be like that in every game.\"",
      "On Amad's equaliser: \"It's something good for the fans. It was a really important goal for us. But I'm more focused on the 90 minutes. And what we did good. That's what I'll tell the players. Sometimes I forget that part and I judge the players when I see the games. But, we are doing things right. We are controlling the game. Of course we can do so much to grow. But there are a lot of things we are doing right.",
      "\"The good thing is I can see so much more potential to do better things. If you combine those two things, we are progressing.\"",

      "Manchester United have won five of their last seven Premier League games and sit sixth; Ruben Amorim is enjoying his best spell at United after finishing 15th last season and losing in the Europa League final; United face Nottingham Forest on Saturday",
      "Saturday 1 November 2025 14:06, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has admitted he questioned his future at Manchester United during his first year at the club.",
      "Amorim will mark his one-year anniversary since agreeing to become the club's head coach on Saturday as United visit Nottingham Forest looking to strengthen their challenge for a place in the Premier League's top four.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has endured a difficult 12 months since arriving from Sporting, finishing 15th, losing in the Europa League final and winning only one of the first five games this season - which left him wondering if he would make it to a year in charge.",
      "\"It's hard to say that. Sometimes, in some moments,\" he said. \"There were some moments that were tough to deal with, to lose so many games. That was so hard for me because this is Manchester United.",
      "\"The position that we had in the last year, putting all the attention on the Europa League and not winning. That was massive. I had some moments that I struggled a lot and I was thinking that maybe it's not meant to be.",
      "\"Today is the opposite. So you can write this one. Today I feel and I know that was the best decision in my life. I want to be here but for that I need to win against Nottingham Forest.\"",
      "Amorim is enjoying his best period at the club with United winning five of their last seven league games, including victories over Chelsea and Liverpool, to put themselves in the mix to qualify for Europe.",
      "However, he is not prepared to declare that the tough times have now passed.",
      "\"It's hard to say. We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is [up and down]. And we are not that team that I can say to you, no, no, no.",
      "\"Now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust in my players more. I think they trust me more. That will come with wins. And you can sense that because everyone now is saying that, how connected they are and they believe in the manager.",
      "\"It's about winning games. It didn't change a lot because against Arsenal, I saw the same team, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think that we are in a better place, but it's also really good to be always with that feeling and prepare that something can change. If we have that feeling, we'll pay attention to the details and we'll maintain that course of our path.",
      "\"I can say that we are a better team in this moment, and we feel that and we know that, and that can help us to overcome better the bad moments.\"",
      "Amorim also responded to comments made by Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche before his appointment at the City Ground.",
      "While out of work in August, Dyche said: \"I may get hammered for it, but I bet I could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2.\"",
      "The former Everton boss did also go on to say Amorim should get time to continue his work at the club.",
      "On Thursday, Amorim said: \"First of all, maybe it is true that if we play in a 4-4-2 we won more games. But I always say that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while and then in the future it is going to be better.",
      "\"We don't know that. I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don't say very strong things, I don't want to watch you. I am the same.",
      "\"I can completely understand that it is a different job. I know Sean Dyche is smart and he knows how to play the game.",
      "\"He understands that there is one thing seeing the game and talking about it. It is another thing to coach a team.\"",
      "Dyche, also speaking on Thursday, said he didn't question Amorim as a person and that \"clickbait kills everything, it changes the whole story\".",
      "He added: \"They said, 'What would be a fair timeline?' and I said, 'Half a season to continue the work he was doing' but unfortunately, that doesn't make the story, we all know that.",
      "\"For the points tally, I was suggesting maybe the basics would have worked better. They have changed their style, fair play to him, his coaching staff, the players. They have changed their style, not necessarily their beliefs, but just their style.",
      "\"They are being a bit quicker to play forwards and longer, a bit tighter and getting back into their shape. That's management, that's coaching.",
      "\"That doesn't mean he's changed his whole philosophy, it just means he's adapting it to the challenge that's right in front of him. Fair play to him.\"",
