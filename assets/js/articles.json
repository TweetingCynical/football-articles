      "Manchester United have made a breakthrough in their bid to sign a striker - with a move for Benjamin Sesko edging closer.",
      "United have been exploring deals for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig forward Sesko as they look for a proven goalscorer to lead their attack.",
      "United are understood to have opened informal talks with Leipzig with regard to Sesko, although no bid has yet been tabled.",
      "Watkins was United's preferred option, given he has Premier League experience, a policy United decided upon this summer in their recruitment, as evidenced by the signings of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "But Villa's £60million valuation of 29-year-old Watkins has proved a stumbling block to any deal being agreed for the England star, with 22-year-old Sesko seen as a more viable option given his age - even though he will cost a similar fee.",
      "Yet United face competition for Sesko, with Newcastle also wanting the Slovenia international to replace Alexander Isak if the £150m-rated Toon striker moves to Liverpool.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for Leipzig and 16 goals in 41 appearances for Slovenia, with United boss Ruben Amorim desperate for a prolific striker to solve his scoring crisis.",
      "United managed just 44 goals in the Premier League last season, with current strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee not able to score consistently enough to warrant leading the attack.",
      "It is understood United approached Villa about Watkins, but were only willing to pay in the region of £45m for him and saw their initial approach rebuffed as it fell way short of their valuation.",
      "Sources in Germany have indicated there is a gentlemen’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko to let him leave for a fee of £60m to £70m plus add-ons - but only to select clubs.",
      "Sesko has been on United's radar for some time and their director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, could play a key role, having worked at Leipzig and the striker's former club, RB Salzburg.",
      "United had originally hoped to sign Liam Delap this summer, but the Ipswich striker moved to Chelsea instead. A number of other strikers have been considered, but Isak and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson were deemed too expensive.",
      "Newcastle will still hope they can persuade Sesko to move to Tyneside if Isak leaves after speaking to Leipzig and the player’s camp.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been told that Nick Pope is not for sale this summer, despite Newcastle United being on the brink of signing Aaron Ramsdale. The Red Devils have been linked with a number of shot-stoppers, as Andre Onana's future is up in the air, despite the fact they only signed him from Inter Milan two years ago in a £47.2million deal.",
      "The 29-year-old from Cameroon has made 101 appearances for United over the past two years. But he has only managed to keep 25 clean sheets, conceding 148 goals in total.",
      "The Red Devils are said to have enquired about AC Milan keeper Mike Maignan at the start of the transfer window, only for the 30-year-old to reportedly rebuff the move. An audacious loan move for Aston Villa No. 1 Emiliano Martinez was also made, however, hopes of an agreement there were quickly quashed, with Villa only considering an exceptional offer for the 2022 World Cup winner.",
      "Now, it appears as though United are eager to bring in Newcastle keeper Pope, according to talkSPORT, given his future as a starter at St James' Park is now in doubt. The Carabao Cup winners are closing in on Southampton's Ramsdale, with the Magpies having agreed a loan deal with an option to buy for the 27-year-old.",
      "It is said Eddie Howe is looking for someone to compete with Pope rather than replace him, on account of his admirable performances at St. James' Park since his arrival in 2022.",
      "Despite a deal nearing completion between Newcastle and Southampton, Ramsdale wasn't the Magpies' first-choice in terms of competition for their current No. 1.",
      "Newcastle prioritised Burnley's James Trafford for much of the window, even submitting a £31m bid for the 22-year-old who impressed in the Championship last term. However, due to a buyback clause that Manchester City inserted into their deal with Burnley when they sold him to the Clarets for £15m in 2023, Pep Guardiola's team were instead able to clinch him for £27m.",
      "Pope was in goal for most of Newcastle United's 1-0 pre-season friendly loss to the K-League XI at the Suwon World Cup Stadium on Wednesday, with Kim Jin-Kyu slotting home the winner after 36 minutes. Joe Willock's worrying looking injury late on is just another issue for the club to deal with.",
      "On top of failing to play a full-strength team for the clash, Newcastle could yet lose talisman Alexander Isak, who is open to parting ways with the club. The Swedish striker wants to explore his options elsewhere, and Liverpool seems the most likely move for Isak, but no agreement has been reached between the clubs as of yet.",
      "Elsewhere, the Red Devils have heavily relied on Altay Bayindir for their own pre-season endeavours, with Onana sidelined with a hamstring injury sustained in training earlier this summer. The 27-year-old impressed during United's 0-0 clash with Leeds earlier this month, before also playing a major part in the Red Devils' 2-1 win over West Ham on Sunday. He is also expected to start during United's game with Bournemouth at Soldier Field on Thursday, with kick off at 2.30am UK time.",
      "Whether United will continue their endeavours of looking at the prospect of signing Pope after the emergence of Newcastle's firm stance remains to be seen. But the right price could turn heads given he is in the last 12 months of his contract.",

The £63.7million striker, who turned down a move to Old Trafford in favour of Arsenal, has told his ex-Sporting boss Ruben Amorim and United exactly what to expect on day one of the new Premier League season.",
      "Fresh off a solo training regime while waiting for his long transfer saga to end, Gyokeres has now joined his new Gunners team-mates in Hong Kong and insists he’s firing on all cylinders.",
      "Asked if he’ll be fit to face United on August 17, he nodded, smiled, and said: “Yeah.” Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is ready to unleash his marquee summer signing as early as Thursday’s friendly against Spurs in Hong Kong.",
      "“He’s only trained today (Wednesday), very little yesterday (Tuesday),” said Arteta. “We’ll assess tonight (Wednesday night). If the medical team are happy, there’s a chance he features.”",
      "Asked why he favoured Arsenal over United and other suitors, Gyokeres was crystal clear: “There were other clubs, of course, but this wasn’t a hard choice. I chose Arsenal.”",
      "And boss Arteta is delighted. Speaking after watching him train in front of a packed Kai Tak stadium, in Hong Kong, Arteta was even more convinced he has the right man who can cope with taking on all-comers, including United.",
      "He said: “When the news broke, and then you realise the magnitude of the club that you're going to be representing and how viral everything goes so fast in these days.",
      "\"I think his immediate reaction was, wow, and then he sees, you know, the way we were received again, the training session that we just had with 20,000 people. I think you're going to have a very good first impression, that's for sure.”",
      "Club captain Martin Odegaard is already excited by what he’s seen. He said: “I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far. Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves.",
      "\"He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher, and intelligent as well. You can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality and the willingness.”",

      "Wayne Rooney's celebrity status has emerged as the reason behind the Manchester United legend being barred from watching his son Kai play football. The 15-year-old is the eldest child of Rooney and wife Coleen, who are also parents to three younger boys - Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai became part of the Red Devils academy in 2016, treading the same path as his iconic father who dedicated 13 years to Old Trafford and holds the club's scoring record with 253 goals.",
      "Despite being recognised as a promising talent, the young striker has informed his celebrated dad that his presence isn't welcome at matches, owing to the enormous crowds he attracts.",
      "The revelation came during Coleen's appearance on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. Prior to securing second place behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, she shared details of her son's difficult choice with her fellow campmates, reports the Express.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen revealed to her jungle companions last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Despite his father's absence, Kai has continued to shine in the academy and even found the net in United's opening SuperCupNI fixture on Monday. The teenager converted from the penalty spot and mimicked the trademark celebration of Arsenal's latest acquisition, Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Following his assist for Sam O'Brien's opener against West Cork Academy, Kai confidently dispatched the spot-kick before team-mate Abdoulaye Bassirou Nkoto sealed a third.",
      "The celebration, which sees Gyokeres mask his face by weaving his fingers together, was devised whilst the Swedish striker was on his holidays, with the forward admitting his mates pushed him to devise his own goal celebration.",
      "\"Before I got it, my friends were always saying to me to find my own celebration because they were very tired of me doing all kinds of stuff when I was celebrating,\" he previously said. \"I had some time off. We went on vacation together. During that time, we came up with it after a while. We thought it looked good, and I started doing it straightaway. It felt even better on the pitch.\"",
      "Despite the existence of his ban, Rooney, 39, attended the tournament in Northern Ireland alongside his wife to keep a keen eye on their son in action. The ex-Plymouth boss spoke to BBC News NI about his son's career in the academy and the role he plays in his progression.",
      "\"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand-off approach,\" Rooney said. \"I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it – that's the main thing for me. It's a long time since I was here, but it does bring back great memories.",
      "\"The Super Cup, like many other tournaments, is a fantastic place to go away as a young person; you're away with your team-mates in a hotel together, and it's great for team building.\"",

A brace from Bruno Fernandes cancelled out Jarrod Bowen's strike for the London club, while new arrival Matheus Cunha also got valuable minutes under his belt.",

Philip Billing and Romain Faivre got themselves on the scoresheet for Bournemouth, while Kieron Bowie pulled one back for the Scottish side.",

In game two of the United States mini-tournament, Manchester United are set to face Bournemouth, while Everton take on West Ham.",

      "But the 30-year-old revealed last season’s prolonged spells out, due to persistent injuries, pushed him to the brink mentally like never before, as he missed 48 of United’s 60 games.",
      "“It's something I've not experienced to be honest,” said Shaw, speaking during United’s US tour. \"I know I've had a lot of injuries, but it was more mentally how tough it was. It was really tough. I won't go too much into that. I think last season it was one to forget.",
      "“It was horrible. It started with a calf and I've never had a calf injury in my life, so I was never used to that. Things just kept happening and it was really stressful, but I'm grateful that I'm here now and I feel fit.",
      "“I feel real happiness right now. I don't want to keep banging on about last season, but I couldn't have got any lower last season.",
      "“So right now I feel really good, really happy with great people around me in the team and a really good manager. I can't feel any better, to be honest. I'm really happy and I'm really looking forward to this season. I've got big ambitions this season and I'm looking to fulfil them.”",
      "After featuring for England at Euro 2024, where he started defeat in the final against Spain, Shaw missed pre-season with United and was ruled out until November.",
      "He came on as a sub in Amorim’s first three games in charge, then suffered another injury setback which saw him sidelined from December to mid-April.",
      "Shaw made his comeback towards the end of last season, but blamed himself for not being available, particularly in the final weeks of former boss Erik ten Hag’s time in charge.",
      "“I kind of felt like I let Erik down with the injuries and stuff,” said Shaw. “I wasn't there for him towards the end, and that wasn't nice. Then, when the new manager comes in and we speak about different things, different aims for the rest of the season that we had, then I get injured again.",
      "“For a lot of last season I just felt like I let a lot of people down in the club and the team, obviously because I was always injured. It was just something in my head where I found it really hard. I just put a lot of blame on myself.",
      "“I just felt that I was letting the team down not being available for a long time. But the team and the manager were really good with me. Especially the manager, he stuck by me.”",
      "Despite United’s embarrassing showing last season, Shaw is adamant they should set their sights high, rather than accepting mediocrity on the back of one miserable campaign. After last season, it might sound a bit ridiculous, but we want to be winning the Premier League,” said Shaw.",
      "“We should have those ambitions. Not just me individually, but the whole team. We all have to have the same ambitions and all push for that. Like I said, it can sound ridiculous because last season was so bad.",

      "United struggled for goals last season, with only Everton and the three relegated sides managing less Premier League goals than their 44. But the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo should provide a major boost having notched 35 between them.",

      "\"Why do I like them? They've got Premier League experience, they look more like Manchester United styles of players with a bit more pace and power and the physicality to get from box to box quickly.",
      "\"I think when you look at Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are more jinkers, more people who work in tight spaces. I've always felt that United need players that can open their legs up and really stretch teams and I think Cunha and Mbeumo do that.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two signings is they've not proved themselves at the highest level yet in respect of Premier League club level or European club level so they should be really desperate and hungry to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last ten years with players that have come to the club. They've maybe been the more finished article and we've got excited by them, but maybe they haven't had that desperation.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has moved to the top of Manchester United's wish-list as they look to add the striker to their ranks. The Red Devils have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, but Ruben Amorim is open to adding more firepower to his side following the club’s dire 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The highly rated Sesko looks set to move on after Leipzig missed out on Champions League football. United will be absent from European football completely this season, but that is not thought to have put the Slovenian off.",
      "Sesko is reportedly favouring a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle, who are also in the market for a top forward, with Liverpool-linked Alexander Isak angling for a move away from Tyneside. According to The Athletic, Sesko is Man United’s priority if they go for another striker this summer and they are said to have made ‘informal’ contact with Leipzig.",
      "The Red Devils are also admirers of Ollie Watkins, but are unwilling to meet Aston Villa's £60m valuation of the 29-year-old England star. A move for Sesko now appeared to be the preferred and more likely option, with United also favouring his youth and potential over a proven quantity like Watkins.",
      "United have been linked with Sesko in the past, but they balked at paying around £2m for the then-16-year-old in 2019. There were subsequent approaches in 2022 and last year before the club signed Joshua Zirkzee. Sesko will now cost many times more after emerging as one of the most promising strikers in Europe, scoring 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig since his arrival in 2023.",
      "His current contract runs until 2029, having only signed a new deal last year. It reportedly came with an understanding that he would be allowed to depart if another club offered in the region of £69m to £78m.",
      "United’s arrivals will need to be offset by some outgoings, with several players declaring their desire to leave the club.

      "Rio Ferdinand has confidently shut down any suggestion Manchester United will make a move for Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Red Devils have made no secret about their desire to bolster their forward line.",
      "They have already brought in Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and recently unveiled £71m signing Bryan Mbeumo. However, the Red Devils are still looking for a new centre-forward, two seasons after forking out £72m on Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko has been one target of interest, while Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins has emerged as the latest priority. In and amongst the latest reports, Mateta has also been linked to Old Trafford in the past.",
      "But when the possibility of the Frenchman moving to United was touted to Ferdinand, the Premier League legend immediately shut down the possibility. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents show, the ex-United and England captain replied: \"We ain’t signing Mateta. Trust me.\"",
      "In March, United were told that Mateta would set them back £40m. Reports from L'Equipe at the time also claimed the Red Devils had opened talks with the Eagles about a move for the 28-year-old.",
      "However, the rumours have since petered out, with United seemingly looking at other targets. They have already seen moves for the likes of Liam Delap, Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres fail, joining rivals Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal respectively.",
      "Mateta struggled when he first started at Palace but has been one of the Premier League's most dangerous forwards since Oliver Glasner took over. Under the Austrian manager, he has contributed 30 goals and five assists in 59 appearances in all competitions.",
      "However, for whatever reason, United are seemingly looking elsewhere. Ferdinand has been following United's pre-season tour of the USA, where they recently beat West Ham 2-1 in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "While the memories of last season's disastrous campaign are still fresh, Ferdinand has seen some positive signs this summer. Commenting on United’s transfer window so far, he added: \"For me personally, I’m hopeful more than anything.",
      "\"There is nothing to give me belief yet. I need to see it. The belief is that we have got two good signings who know the Premier League. That’s nice, that’s good, that’s needed.",
      "\"Again, I think we probably need one or two more to go into the season and go, 'Listen, I’m confident we can now go and finish in the top eight.' At the moment, I am sitting there thinking, 'There’s a lot of hangover from last season.’",
      "\"If you start actually digging into last season, it starts depressing me. But the new signings give you a bit of hope. Being out on tour helps you get a different perspective.",
      "\"It guides you and you’re now going, 'Oh, I can see them working, I can see some positive things, the team are together, the manager is getting time with the team.’ I am looking for positives.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has vowed to fight for his place and prove his worth for Manchester United – despite their search for a new striker.",
      "Zirkzee endured a difficult debut season at United, following his £36.5million move from Bologna, scoring just seven goals from 49 appearances. United are pushing to sign a new striker, with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins their top target, and have already signed two forwards this summer in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But Holland forward Zirkzee said he welcomes the competition from new arrivals and said it can help bring out the best in him and his fellow attackers.",
      "“I’m very confident, everyone’s very confident,” said Zirkzee. “We’ve got competition, so whichever position the coach needs me is the position I’ll play – if that’s as a No.10 or a striker, it’s no different.",
      "“The coach knows me well and knows exactly what to do and I’ve got 100 percent trust in the coach so I’m not worried about that.",
      "“It’s part of being at this club [competition]. If another striker were to come, I guess it’s only good competition, so I’m not really worried.",
      "“They [Cunha and Mbeumo ] are two great players. We’ve seen that in training and we’ve seen that last season as well. We’re for the team and that’s what we’re all about. We just want the team to be good.",
      "“Everything is for the team, there’s no selfishness here, that’s not my mantra. If it were to help the team, then great. I’m not here to decide what’s fair and unfair, I just know that me and Rasmus [Hojlund] can do better and have to do better.",
      "“The manager wants goals, so that’s what I have to work on. That’s what it all comes down to. In the end, if you’re up top, you’re supposed to score goals. I’m not going to take that fact away.”",
      "Zirkzee’s lowest point last season came when he was booed by his own fans at Old Trafford in January when he was subbed after 33 minutes with United trailing 2-0 to Newcastle.",
      "He headed straight down the tunnel, visibly upset, but returned to the bench, and revealed how the support of his team-mates helped him through the ordeal.",
      "“The guys are always there for me,” said Zirkzee. “Bruno [Fernandes], of course, is the captain. We’ve got a great group and we’re all there for each other, so every individual wants the best for all of us. In that case, I can lean on a lot of guys in the team.”",
      "Zirkzee missed United’s US tour-opening 2-1 win over West Ham because of injury and said: “It’s a small injury, not a serious problem.",
      "“It’s pre-season. It’s not like last season, when I pushed myself to be there for the Europa League final. Now I just want to be there for the start of the season.”",

      "Roy Keane believes Ollie Watkins is capable of leading the line for Manchester United as the Red Devils focus in on the Aston Villa striker as their top target. Ruben Amorim has already added Mattheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to his attacking threat for the new season, but he is still on the hunt for a new No. 9 to front up his rebuild.",
      "It seems that United are shopping locally for their new signings, with Premier League experience clearly valued by the club's hierarchy this summer. Villa have remained adamant that Watkins is not for sale, but previously valued the 29-year-old at £60million, giving Old Trafford chiefs a benchmark to reach.",
      "However, United are confident that a compromise price of between £40m and £45m can be agreed between both parties to secure Watkins' services. Club icon Keane has weighed in on the Watkins debate before, stating that he believes the striker has what it takes to handle the pressure of a big club, as he put it.",
      "\"That’s a compliment to him, not that he has to leave Villa. But he’s capable of doing it.\" Discussing the striker's form at the time, Keane added: \"The kid is so sharp, he has a great shape to him. His movement is as good as any striker in the Premier League. He’s having an amazing season.\"",
      "Across 54 appearances last season, Watkins scored 17 goals and assisted 14 times. This type of return is exactly what United are after as they aim to improve what has been a disaster start to Amorim's reign.",
      "United already have two strikers on their books in Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, but it is safe to say the duo haven't exactly impressed during their time at the club. In total, Hojlund and Zirzkee have scored 17 goals between them, matching Watkins' solo endeavours at Villa last time out.",
      "Zirkzee only managed seven goals and three assists across all competitions for United following his £36.5m arrival last summer, while £72m man Hojlund hit 10 goals and four assists in 52 appearances. Amorim is aware that in order for his side to reach some level of success, he will require a more proven goalscoring record - and Watkins could be another cog in this puzzle.",
      "As well as Watkins, the Red Devils are also keeping tabs on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old was consistent for a struggling Bundesliga side last campaign, scoring 13 goals and assisting five times in 33 league appearances.",
      "Sesko also scored four times across eight Champions League games for Leipzig, proving he can hold his weight in European competitions too. However, a £70m price tag could be off-putting to United, given that they have already dropped over £120m on Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "The Red Devils also have other areas to prioritise and are in the market for a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper. Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have not convinced Amorim that either of them are capable enough to hold the No. 1 jersey, with both being used sporadically throughout the 2024/25 campaign, not to much success.",
      "The United boss also hopes to strengthen his midfield with a solid deep-laying playmaker, as Casemiro's veteran status rules him out of the starting position. Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are also both options, but Amorim seems to like playing Mainoo further forward - and it doesn't seem like he is happy with the £50m paid to bring Ugarte from PSG last summer.",
      "But number one on the manager's agenda is a new frontman, and with Newcastle United also in the race for Sesko's signature, Amorim may opt for Premier League pedigree and a cheaper fee in Watkins. Keane's seal of approval holds weight too, given his success in United's colours in years gone by.",

      "It's believed that Watkins would be open to a move to United, while Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has kept communication lines open with the Red Devils since discussing a potential move last year.",
      "The Slovenian international has been a hot topic in the transfer market since the end of the 2024/25 season. Arsenal seemed keen on Sesko but decided to pursue Viktor Gyokeres instead, sealing a £63.7million deal for the Swede last week.",
      "Now, it appears United and Newcastle are vying for Sesko's signature, with both Amorim and Eddie Howe eager to bolster their attacking options. However, various reports suggest that the striker is more inclined towards a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Former Chelsea goalkeeper Petrovic had high praise for Sesko ahead of Euro 2024 last year, stating he \"has everything\" needed to succeed in the Premier League.",
      "Before the tournament, Petrovic had watched Sesko play several times and assured the Blues that he'd be a surefire success in the English top flight.",
      "\"I know [about the rumours linking him with Chelsea] and have been following him,\" Petrovic, who now plays for Bournemouth, told Nogomania. \"He's having a good half season, he's in great scoring form. I read that he's scored in his last seven matches in a row. He seems to have gained strong momentum for the Euros.",
      "\"He's a forward who has everything a modern player needs. He's tall, strong, fast and intelligent. I've watched some of his matches. Of course he can play in the Premier League. Absolutely! He has great potential, and he's been successfully proving it.\"",
      "According to Sky in Germany, United's board has been in touch with Sesko, and talks about a potential transfer to Old Trafford are possible. Should Sesko touch down in Manchester, manager Amorim has made it crystal clear exactly what he expects from any new recruits, saying: \"They have to want to come here.",
      "\"I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player.",
      "\"We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project. And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point.",
      "\"If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.\"",

Amorim has made it his mission to restore high standards on and off the pitch at United and axed a group of players from the US tour to underline his uncompromising approach.",

He’s made that very clear.",
      "“There are no stragglers in this group anymore. Us players, especially the more experienced ones, need to be demanding more from a day-in, day-out basis.",
      "“The levels in training, keeping the times of when we’re doing this and doing that, making sure no one’s coming late or anything. We all need to up the level of demands. What Ruben definitely brings in is the demands, especially the mentality.",
      "“The mentality is a big thing. He talks a lot about it. Ruben demands 100 per cent and he doesn’t want anything less. If someone’s doing 85 to 90 per cent, it’s not enough for him. Especially this year, if you’re not doing the right things, I feel like you won’t play.",
      "“You’ve seen what he’s done in the past eight months with different players. He doesn’t care who the player is. If he’s not following what he wants, then that’s how it should be, and rightly so.”",
      "Shaw, currently United’s longest-serving player, has worked with five permanent managers in 11 years and admitted the atmosphere within the squad has been toxic at times.",
      "“It’s not hard to see from the outside what it’s been like,” said Shaw. “A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative. It can be quite toxic, the environment, it’s not healthy at all.",

Things come together and, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel the bond is growing.",

      "Liverpool will once again fail to lift back-to-back Premier League titles, according to a supercomputer which has predicted the full 2025-26 table. The Reds were crowned champions last season after a stunning start to life under new manager Arne Slot.",
      "Very few had backed Liverpool to win the title following the departure of Jurgen Klopp but a slump from Manchester City and Arsenal's failure to capitalise allowed Slot's side cruise to victory without a formidable challenge. That's set to change this term, though, with City having made 10 signings since the turn of year and Arsenal finally addressing their issues up front.",
      "Liverpool have, of course, spent more than anyone and won't stop at £269million. The reigning champions want to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak for a British-record transfer fee of at least £125m.",

      "Arsenal would finish second for the fourth year running, a new record, with City reclaiming the title under Pep Guardiola. There's also good news for Manchester United, who'd shoot up 10 places but narrowly miss out on Champions League football to Chelsea.",
      "Aston Villa would pip Tottenham to sixth place while Newcastle, West Ham and Everton round out the top half. Unfortunately for the three teams promoted from the Championship - Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds - they'd all go straight back down, a worrying trend which we've seen in the past two seasons.",
      "These are all predictions made by an AI supercomputer, via Sportscasting, which has simulated the upcoming Premier League season. Explaining City's title win, it said: \"Even without any seismic squad changes, their machine-like system - powered by Omar Marmoush, Phil Foden, the returning Rodri, and a 36-goal season from Erling Haaland - keeps them dominant.",

      "Tuttomercatoweb reports that the Bianconeri have agreed personal terms with the England international and have also agreed a fee of £15m with the Premier League side - who are set to accept a loss of more than £50m on Sancho, four years after signing him.",
      "The move is on hold though with Juventus now needing to sell up to three players to help finance the move. Timothy Weah, who has been on Nottingham Forest's radar, is among the players they are looking to move on.",
      "Nico Gonzalez could all be sold whilst Dusan Vlahovic is deemed surplus to requirements. Juventus recently hired a new manager in Igor Tudor and it means the Serbian, who was previously prolific at Fiorentina and on Arsenal's radar, is going to have to find pastures new.",
      "No timeframe has been put in place regarding how long Juventus have to get rid off their players, but Sancho is growing impatient as he prepares to embrace a new environment after several tough years in Manchester. Other teams remain in the wings with Dortmund credited with an interest.",
      "Sancho is one of several players in Manchester who are waiting to see if they can secure moves away. Marcus Rashford has already done so, heading to Barcelona on loan. Antony has returned from an impressive loan spell at Real Betis which may revive interest in him.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim and the club are open to his departure. His antics have frustrated his head coach and the hierarchy but no offers have been forthcoming for the Argentine, who has previously impressed at the club.",

      "Manchester United face a harsh reality as the club work on shipping out the players who wish to leave the club this summer. Manager Ruben Amorim left five first-team stars out of his pre-season plans ahead of Marcus Rashford’s loan move to Barcelona, having been informed that Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia also wanted to exit.",
      "Recouping money from the so-called 'bomb squad' could bolster United’s transfer plans. Yet, the Red Devils have reportedly lowered several of their valuations since the transfer window first opened, which will not be welcome news to United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Rashford has sealed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, who have a £26million option to make his stay at the Camp Nou permanent. That is a significant drop from United’s reported £100m valuation last April and is even less than the £40m price given to Aston Villa. However, United slashing Rashford’s past valuation by £74m is only a fraction of the total £213m United could lose as the club attempt to part with their wantaway players.",
      "Garnacho is another player whose price has dropped significantly since the start of the summer. The Argentine winger, who was linked with Chelsea and Napoli, was initially said to be worth £70m.",
      "However, United have since almost halved their asking price to £40m. This would represent a £30m difference in what United were expecting to receive from selling the talented 21-year-old, who scored 11 goals across all competitions.",
      "The writing appeared to be on the wall following Garnacho’s reaction to being named on the bench for the Europa League final last season. In the aftermath, Garnacho said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Antony’s productive loan spell at Real Betis last term would have boosted United’s hopes of recouping a significant portion of the £82m that they paid Ajax three years ago. The Red Devils quoted around £40m for Betis to sign the winger permanently, having scored nine goals and provided five assists in 26 appearances for the club.",
      "The price was deemed too high for Betis, though Antony’s valuation has remained around that mark. That would see United take a huge £42m hit on the Brazil international.",
      "Sancho is another high-profile signing who has never lived up to expectations at Old Trafford. There was plenty of fanfare when the England winger arrived for £73m in 2021 on the back of his sensational spell at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "However, Sancho failed to replicate that form for United before a fallout with ex-manager Erik ten Hag led to him being exiled from the squad in 2023. A brief return to Dortmund and a subsequent loan spell at Chelsea failed to prompt a permanent move.",
      "Football Italia has since reported that Juventus have made a £15m offer for Sancho, who is in the final year of his contract. This would be £58m less than his original transfer fee.",
      "Despite the financial hits that the club could take in the transfer market, United boss Amorim has insisted that he would welcome the players back into the fold if no deal can be finalised. “There are different reasons for the players [left behind],” he said.",
      "“Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams. We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide. If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players.",
      "“I know for a fact, these people, Jason [Wilcox, technical director], Omar [Berrada, chief executive] and the club have a number for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.",
      "“I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition if you want to play in the World Cup next year, so you need to play. I'm really happy with that because I have more options. If they have to fight each other to play one game a week, for me it’s perfect.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is convinced that Bruno Fernandes will help him deliver the goals Manchester United crave this season. Mbeumo is getting to know his new team-mates on United’s pre-season tour of the United States after making a £71million move from Brentford and is excited by the prospect of playing with his new captain.",
      "United beat competition from Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle and Chelsea to land Mbeumo in the summer transfer window. The Cameroon international scored 20 goals for Brentford in the Premier League last season and is now tasked with revitalising an ailing attack which managed just 44 goals in 38 league games in 2024/25.",
      "Mbeumo will aim to link up with fellow new arrival Matheus Cunha, while United are hoping to sign a centre-forward to complete their new-look frontline before the window closes. But whoever may be in the pipeline, Mbeumo is delighted to have Fernandes assisting him.",
      "Appearing on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast in the US, he was asked which team-mates he’s most looking forward to playing with. “Of course, Bruno. Of course, yeah,” he replied.",
      "“Yeah, everyone sees it in the past years – he has a really good foot. He can shoot, he can cross, he can do crazy balls. Yeah, for a striker, you just enjoy that.”",
      "Asked how he would develop an understanding with him, Mbeumo added: “I think it's a little bit of everything. As I said, you earn experience from everyone. So it's always good to speak to someone like this.",
      "“But at the end, I think on the pitch, when you're smart like he is, I think you don't even need to think a lot. You just need to make the run and he's going to play you in the right space every time.",
      "“But of course, you can have a little discussion to make him know how I prefer the balls and how I'm feeling the best to have the ball. But at a certain point, there is only one way, even if it's not the one you like, you have to do the run and he's going to put the ball in a good position.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is certain that Fernandes is going to be key to United’s chances in the 2025/26 season. Speaking after their 2-1 win over West Ham on their pre-season tour, he hailed his skipper.",
      "“You can see it in the assists, the goals, but not just that,” he said. “I think now he has more players [around him]. I've felt that on the tour. I feel that now there are more players to help him to lead the group. That is a good thing.",
      "“But he's our leader, so he's really important. Not just on the field, but also off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and sometimes he plays with pain.”",

United have found it hard going in the market, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City all completing more deals so far.",
      "The Aston Villa striker is keen on a move to Old Trafford, but United won’t pay £60m for his services, hoping to shake hands at £40-45m. They have also held talks with Benjamin Sesko’s representatives and he is an alternative.",
      "While a centre-forward is the top priority after a miserable 2024/25 season, Ruben Amorim still wants to strengthen elsewhere too. The Independent reports that they also want a new goalkeeper and a deep-lying midfielder.",
      "United are looking for a new keeper after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Onana was dropped by Amorim during the 2024/25 campaign, only for Bayindir to fail to take his chance when it came, too.",
      "They have been linked with ambitious interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma, as well as Newcastle’s Nick Pope and Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Meanwhile, an athletic holding midfielder is wanted by Amorim following a succession of issues last season in the position. Casemiro does not have the legs to cover the ground required, Kobbie Mainoo is better further forward and Manuel Ugarte is yet to convince following his £50m move from PSG last summer.",
      "Amorim has recently explained what he’s looking for in new signings. “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already,\" he said.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",

      "Said Benrahma was also part the attack but it was only Mbeumo who stayed with Brentford for the long haul. Watkins' goals saw Villa come calling whilst Benrahma headed to West Ham and is now in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The season they spent together in the Championship the trio scored 59 times between them as Brentford made it to the play-off final. This year just passed Mbeumo had a career-best year at Brentford and Watkins, who endured a frustrating season at Villa Park, came up with 17 goals.",

      "Luke Shaw admits the Manchester United environment has been \"toxic\" in recent years and head coach Ruben Amorim will not pick players who fall short of his demands.",
      "United endured their worst season in 51 years in 2024-25 and the season ended with Amorim telling winger Alejandro Garnacho he could leave after he questioned the Portuguese's decision to bench him in the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho remains part of the 'bomb squad' that have been exiled from the first-team squad and ordered to train when their teammates are not on the premises at Carrington.",
      "Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia remain on United's books as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho and Rashford for the Manchester derby on December 15 and the latter is unlikely to play for United again. Rashford was disciplined twice by former manager Erik ten Hag, while Sancho was banished from the squad after accusing the Dutchman of lying. Shaw acknowledged there were \"no stragglers in this group any more\".",
      "\"A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative,\" Shaw said. \"It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all.",
      "\"We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. I think when you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and I think, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel like the bond is growing and growing.",
      "\"I feel like in my time here, it's probably the closest I've felt with the squad since I've been here. I think the atmosphere is really good and extremely positive. Hopefully, that can continue.",
      "\"The manager has to [take action] because at the end of the day, he's going to be the one that has his job always on the line. He wants to come in and do exactly what he wants because he's always the one who's on the end of the stick. He wants to come in and do things his own way and stamp his own authority on the club. I think that's the only way you can do it, especially at Man United.",
      "\"I think we need to just all up the level of demands. That's what I think Ruben definitely brings in, is the demands. Especially the mentality. The mentality is a big thing on his lips, really. I think he talks a lot about it. Especially in day-to-day things, with the training. Ruben demands 100% and that's it and he doesn't want anything less.",
      "\"If someone's doing 85-90%, it's not enough for him. I think, especially this year, if you're not doing the right things, I feel like you won't play.",
      "\"And he's not bothered. I think you've seen what he's done in the past eight months with different players and things like that. He doesn't care who the player is. I think if he's not following what he wants, then that's how it should be, and I think rightly so. I think whatever the manager wants, us as players we have to be delivering that. So, yes, we're fully behind that.\"",
      "Shaw, 30, gave a raw interview moments after the Europa League final defeat consigned United to only a second season without European football in 35 years where he said United players had to \"question whether they're good enough\".",
      "The left back has played 27 games in the two full seasons since he signed a four-year contract worth around £200,000-a-week and this is his 12th pre-season with United. Bruno Fernandes, who joined United five-and-a-half years after Shaw, overtook him for club appearances last term.",
      "Shaw, who has started a meagre 20 United games in two years, has no regrets about his post-match candour and admitted he had \"an awful year\".",
      "\"I wouldn't say regret, but I think straight after the game your head's hot and you just say things and you don't think about it,\" he explained. \"I think a lot of people after that final, after that year, had the feeling of you don't know how next season's going to look.",
      "\"I think we have to be open and honest about that. I think none of us were good enough. I think there always has to be that question about what we think and what our plans for the next season. I just don't really know what more to say about that.",
      "\"It's never easy losing a final, especially after the season that we went through. It was even harder to take. Like I said, I think that's why my head was a bit hotter than usual as well.",
      "\"I think I had such an awful year as well. I was just fully angry about everything. I just think that's why I did the interview and said what I said.\"",
      "Shaw joined United 11 years ago and his first few at the club were beset by injury issues and he was publicly criticised by his managers. Louis van Gaal bluntly said Shaw was \"not fit enough\" during his first pre-season in 2014 and Jose Mourinho despaired at how immature Shaw conducted himself.",
      "After Shaw was late for training once, he innocently told staff that his mother had overslept and not woken him up in time. Now Shaw is preaching the importance of punctual timekeeping.",
      "\"I think us as players, especially the more experienced ones, we need to be demanding more from a day-in, day-out basis,\" he added. \"The levels in training, keeping the times of when we're doing this and doing that, making sure no one's coming late or anything.\"",

      "Manchester United take on Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series tonight.",
      "United drew with Leeds in Stockholm in their opening friendly of pre-season and followed that result with a 2-1 victory over West Ham, which was the first friendly in the United States.",
      "Ruben Amorim's attention will now turn to facing Bournemouth in Chicago. The Cherries have won 3-0 in their last two visits to Old Trafford in the Premier League and that should be motivation for United.",
      "Regarding the team news, Bryan Mbeumo is not fit enough to be involved, and it remains to be seen whether Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui return after minor injuries.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should start...",
      "I really liked what I saw against West Ham last weekend, so I would just make one minor change to the starting team, replacing Altay Bayindir with Tom Heaton in between the sticks.",
      "Bayindir has been unconvincing and Heaton should be the second-choice goalkeeper. The remainder of the team should be unchanged because United looked well-organised, pressed intelligently and looked fluid in attack against West Ham at the MetLife Stadium.",
      "Amorim has played Kobbie Mainoo in the deeper midfield role throughout pre-season so far and his performances have been promising. Mainoo clearly has a decent understanding with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "It's a shame that Mbeumo isn't set to feature in this game, but Matheus Cunha should provide entertainment again.",
      "It was only a pre-season friendly but Manchester United put in a really positive performance against West Ham United at the weekend.",
      "With that in mind, I wouldn't make too many changes to the team that started that game but I would like to see Tom Heaton given a go from the start.",
      "If there is to be a change in the goalkeeping department this summer, it is likely that Altay Bayindir is the player who leaves the club and given Heaton will be at the club regardless, he deserves some minutes from the start.",
      "I would also hand Harry Maguire a start in place of Ayden Heaven, given the back three of Yoro, De Ligt and Maguire is probably the back three that will line up against Arsenal on the opening weekend of the Premier League season.",
      "Mason Mount needs some time from the start but perhaps that could come against Everton, where Bruno Fernandes could perhaps drop into a deeper role again. For this game, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte deserve another chance to build on their positive partnership in the midfield.",

      "The best interviews with Manchester United's players often take place in pre-season.",
      "The players are more relaxed in a luxury setting abroad, journalists are granted more time during the sit-down and chats take place ahead of a new campaign, so there is a clean slate.",
      "There are 'positive vibes' on pre-season tour, particularly this summer because United have reached rock bottom and the only way is up. The arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have boosted morale, probably just as much as Ruben Amorim's decision to axe the 'bomb squad' from his plans.",
      "And Luke Shaw spoke to journalists in Chicago this week, producing some fascinating quotes.",
      "\"A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative. It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all,\" said Shaw about the dressing room.",
      "\"We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. I think when you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and I think, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel like the bond is growing and growing.",
      "\"I feel like in my time here, it's probably the closest I've felt with the squad since I've been here. I think the atmosphere is really good and extremely positive. Hopefully, that can continue.",
      "\"The manager has to [take action] because at the end of the day, he's going to be the one that has his job always on the line. He wants to come in and do exactly what he wants because he's always the one who's on the end of the stick. He wants to come in and do things his own way and stamp his own authority on the club. I think that's the only way you can do it, especially at Man United.",
      "\"I think we need to just all up the level of demands. That's what I think Ruben definitely brings in, is the demands. Especially the mentality. The mentality is a big thing on his lips, really.",
      "\"I think he talks a lot about it. Especially in day-to-day things, with the training. Ruben demands 100% and that's it and he doesn't want anything less.\"",
      "Amorim did not improve results following his arrival from Sporting Lisbon, but he tackled an unhealthy culture at Carrington by laying down the law in the dressing room.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho were dropped from the squad to face Manchester City in December. Rashford was permanently exiled, but Garnacho was reintegrated before working his ticket again.",
      "Both players were not included in Amorim's plans for the new campaign and the 40-year-old deserves credit for taking on two talented members of the dressing room. It would have been more convenient to give them further chances rather than outright axing them from the squad.",
      "Amorim wants talented players who possess the right personality and character. Erik ten Hag addressed the culture during his reign, but there was more work to do when Amorim arrived in November.",
      "Some will not want to hear from Shaw given his injury record, but he is an experienced professional and is well-positioned to provide insight, so his selection of the word 'toxic' gave a glimpse behind the curtain.",
      "It feels like United are closer to achieving a healthy dressing room than they've ever been since 2013. Each United manager has tried to foster a perfect culture, but egos have been allowed to fester.",
      "Amorim's work behind the scenes to create an improved culture is just as important as getting tactics right on a matchday because a sporting institution cannot succeed without strong culture.",
      "The feeling of the squad, how players interact with each other and carry themselves away from the pitch is so important. Rashford and Garnacho had let themselves down at times and Amorim deemed that unacceptable.",
      "The raising of standards is a huge positive ahead of the new campaign.",

      "Manchester United are advancing with a potential move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. Ruben Amorim's side are in the market for a new No.9 and Sesko, 22, has emerged as their preferred option.",
      "Ollie Watkins had been considered, but Aston Villa remain insistent that the England international is not for sale. Indeed, United have shifted their focus to Sesko, who scored 21 goals in 45 matches last season.",
      "Sesko signed a five-year contract at Leipzig last summer and his new deal came with the understanding that if an elite club - by his definition - offered in the region of £69million to £78m, the German side would allow him to leave.",
      "If United sign Sesko, he would complete a 'dream' front three and attacking line-up for Ruben Amorim next season. The former Red Bull Salzburg forward would come in and lead the line with Rasmus Hojlund acting as the back-up.",
      "Behind Sesko would be the two attacking midfielders in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. First, Matheus Cunha would slot into the left No.10 position following his £62.5m move from Wolves last month.",
      "Cunha, 26, netted 17 times and provided six assists in 36 appearances for Vitor Pereira's side in 2024/25 and is going to bring some more attacking flair and creative spark to United's front line.",
      "Alongside Cunha in the right No.10 position would be another new signing, this time Bryan Mbeumo after he completed a £65m plus add-ons move to Old Trafford earlier this month.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, found the net on 20 occasions and added nine assists in 42 matches for Brentford last season and would add some proven Premier League class, like Cunha, to United's attack.",
      "Bruno Fernandes therefore would drop back into central midfield alongside one of Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo. Patrick Dorgu and Amad Diallo would be used as the two wing-backs.",
      "With Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo as United's new-look dream front three, Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount would provide support from the bench and come in when required.",
      "That would leave Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho to be sold before the end of the summer transfer window. It was reported on Tuesday that United were willing to sell Garnacho for around £30m, while Antony and Sancho are expected to depart the Reds in the coming weeks.",
      "United dream attack for Amorim: Mbeumo, Cunha, Sesko",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",

      "It remains to be seen where Sesko will end up this summer, having previously been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool. If the striker was to join United, though, his dream shirt number would not be available.",
      "As is often the case when a new signing is confirmed, they are soon given a squad number that they will wear during their time at the club. For United, if they were to sign Sesko, they would ideally want to confirm a squad number fairly soon after his arrival.",

      "However, that number is currently unavailable at United, having been taken by summer signing Diego Leon earlier this summer. Sesko also wore the No.30 during his time at Red Bull Salzburg before he joined Leipzig.",
      "The Slovenia international has previously worn numbers 21 and 29 at the start of his career, but has worn No.30 since the 2020/21 season. No.21 is currently held by Antony at United, although the Brazilian does look set to leave the club this summer, while 29 is vacant.",

      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn’t really exist here. We’re still in the last century on data analysis here. There’s immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we’re in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here. These things don’t happen overnight.",

With RB Leipzig having missed out on the Champions League, it seemed only a matter of time before Sesko was set to leave and a gentleman's agreement between the player, his agent and the club could allow him to depart for as little as £69m.",

United currently have four players training away from the first team, with Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, and Tyrell Malacia all available for sale.",

After narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day of last season with a 2-0 loss to United, the England international is said to be open to exploring new opportunities.",
      "However, Villa's current stance is that Watkins is not for sale. The 29-year-old also reportedly has doubts over a potential move to Old Trafford due to the Reds' inability to offer European football following their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in May.",

      "Manchester United academy graduate Brandon Williams featured for Hull City in their pre-season friendly against Sunderland on Tuesday night.",
      "Williams, 24, left United last summer when his contract expired, but has yet to sign for a new club. The player received a suspended prison sentence in May after admitting to dangerous driving and driving without insurance during an incident in August 2023.",
      "Hull, however, have now taken the player on trial, training with the team before coming on as a second-half substitute for the final 20 minutes of their latest friendly. Their head coach, Sergej Jakirovic, explained the decision afterwards.",
      "\"I like to help people because everyone deserves a second chance in life,\" he told Hull Live. \"I spoke with him very honestly, and I explained to him what I expect from him.",
      "\"We will be very careful, very, very slow. We have time, so we will try to help him. I think the quality is there because he was on a high level at Man United, so his quality is there. We need him to bring good fitness, and then we will make a decision.",
      "\"For me, his mentality is good. From our conversations, he's a very normal guy. He just asked me yesterday (Monday), 'can I play?' and then I asked him, 'do you feel comfortable to play some minutes?' His desire is there, and so is the hard work.",
      "\"On Saturday [when they played Stockport County at Edgeley Park], we left him here in Hull to carry on training, and so far, everything has gone according to the plan.\"",
      "Williams has not played a competitive match for approaching two years since the last of his 17 appearances during a loan spell at Ipswich Town in late December 2023. The full-back played in 51 games for United, all but one while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge",

      "This week, Ruben Amorim's side are set to face Premier League opposition in Bournemouth and Everton in friendly matches. Before the campaign kicks-off, they'll also host Serie A side Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "Elsewhere, the transfer rumour mill continues to turn, with United having already strengthened the squad through the additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Marcus Rashford recently departed for Barcelona on loan and further outgoings are expected; with the futures of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho uncertain.",
      "Player sales could help free up both squad space and funds for attacking reinforcements. A new striker is widely reported to be a main priority for the manager this summer - with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko on their short-list.",
      "Here's the latest news and rumours surrounding United and the Slovenia international;",
      "United have already beaten Newcastle United to one signing this summer in Mbeumo and they now appear to be going head-to-head with them again, this time for Sesko. With Liverpool showing strong interest in Alexander Isak, Sesko has reportedly emerged as a key target for Newcastle.",
      "According to Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg, the Magpies are prepared to submit an offer to Leipzig as soon as they receive the go-ahead from the player in question. The Bundesliga club are said to be demanding near to €80million for Sesko.",
      "However, the report also states that United \"have not given up\" on their pursuit of the 22-year-old Slovenian international. The club have already presented their project to Sesko, who is reportedly impressed by United's approach and interest.",
      "In the race for Sesko, United may have one notable advantage over their Premier League rivals with their long-standing interest in the player. United were strongly linked with Sesko in the summer of 2022, when he was still playing for RB Salzburg.",
      "At the time, journalist Fabrizio Romano revealed on his YouTube channel that United had held talks with Sesko's representatives, while exploring options to strengthen their attack. However, Salzburg were determined to keep him for another season, ultimately selling him to Leipzig the following summer.",
      "The article adds that challenges remain in securing either player, and that any progress may depend on the club successfully offloading Sancho and Tyrell Malacia before the transfer window closes.",

      "Two strikers remain on Manchester United's radar in the summer transfer window.",
      "Sources have indicated the search has been whittled down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, with the former United's preferred option.",
      "Watkins is a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. He has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024.",
      "Watkins and Sesko have very different profiles, so it will be fascinating to see which player is signed.",
      "Sesko has not played in the Premier League and there is no guarantee he could make the transition from RB Leipzig to United, which is another reason to lean towards Watkins.",
      "However, Sesko has established himself as one of the finest goalscoring prospects in Europe and his ceiling is high, while Watkins has already maximised his potential as he approaches his 30th birthday.",
      "Sesko could prove to be better value for money in the long term and RB Leipzig would allow him to leave for a bid in the region of £69million to £78m, which is a reasonable valuation.",
      "The 22-year-old could develop into a world-class forward and he's been on United's radar for a few years. His agent, Elvis Basanovic, even visited Carrington and Old Trafford during talks over a possible move in 2022.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago as he opted for a move to RB Leipzig, where has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances, but the player has earmarked this summer as a chance for a big move.",
      "There is a degree of risk involved with Sesko that does not come with Watkins. Would he adapt to the demands of the Premier League? Would he settle quickly in England? How many seasons would it take him to score consistently? These are the types of questions United decision-makers will be asking.",
      "Sesko's goalscoring record in the Bundesliga is similar to Watkins' in the Premier League, but the German top flight is not as competitive and he is still raw, which must be considered.",
      "United scored a measly 44 goals in the league last season and it's logical to sign a striker who is proven in the division. Watkins would be a relatively short-term fix, but he would be effective and Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from playing second fiddle to a forward with such nous.",
      "So, would Aston Villa be happy to sanction a move for Watkins? United sources concede a sizeable bid would be required, but reports in the Midlands have claimed Watkins is not for sale. Who would lead their attack if Watkins was sold? Villa opted against signing Marcus Rashford permanently and Jhon Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the winter transfer window.",
      "It would be a bold move to sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows.",
      "Villa are now one of United's rivals due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Emery's side would probably be better off sticking with what they have this summer, which raises the possibility of United leaning towards Sesko.",

      "Whisper it quietly, but this might finally be the season Manchester United finally see the best of Mason Mount in a red shirt.",
      "When United signed the England international midfielder from Chelsea in a deal worth up to £60million two years ago it was seen as a major coup to get one of their rivals' biggest talents.",
      "One of Mount's greatest abilities was his availability and managers ranging from Thomas Tuchel to Gareth Southgate to Frank Lampard all hailed him as a coach's dream.",
      "Erik ten Hag thought he was going to get the same feeling but, ironically, since joining United, his lack of availability has been a major problem. A number of unfortunate injuries have restricted Mount to just 30 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in Manchester.",
      "However, he ended last season strongly and scored twice in United's 4-1 Europa League semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao and played a prominent role in the side.",
      "Speaking back in March, United boss Ruben Amorim described why he 'really loved' Mount and why his version of United needed a player like him in the team.",
      "\"I really love Mason Mount,\" he said. \"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "\"You saw players who had a lot of problems in time but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Mount was signed as a deeper midfield option by Ten Hag but always thrived in a more advanced role at Chelsea. That is where Amorim sees him playing for United, too, but he will have fierce competition this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can play in that role while new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, have been brought in to play in that position.",
      "Mount has a fight on his hands but it is one he seems up for and insists he has ensured he's returned to pre-season feeling as strong as possible.",
      "\"I look at the end of last season and that was positive for me, to get back in the shape that I was in and be able to play and finish the end of the season off, to get a few goals, and to be back in and amongst the lads. That's the most important thing,\" he said.",
      "\"We're all in this together, and I think this period now is so important for us to spend together to train. But yeah, personally, I'm feeling really good. I feel like I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm so excited for the start of the season.\"",
      "So far, Mount's body has held up in pre-season, having come off the bench in the draw with Leeds and the win over West Ham.",
      "With games against Bournemouth and Everton to come in the USA this week, the 26-year-old will be keen to make his mark ahead of what is a make-or-break season for him in the eyes of United fans.",
      "Amorim's system and support should get the best out of Mount. It is now time for him to deliver what United fans have waited two years to see.",

      "Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo are the only senior players to have been added to the Reds squad this close season. There were question marks as to whether Leon would be integrated in the senior squad after his first move to European football but the full-back has excelled in training and youngster Harry Amass will instead be loaned out.",
      "Despite the deals done already, United will be keen to add further strength to their squad this summer. As such, MEN Sport has continued its daily look at some of the top rumours surrounding the club.",
      "Writing in his GiveMeSport column, journalist Fabrizio Romano has shed light on the rumours linking United with a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma. According to him, the Reds have not made any contact with the Italian at this stage.",
      "However, Romano understands that United do want a new goalkeeper but the 'numbers' need to be right.",
      "What MEN Sport says: We understand that there is currently no set budget available for a new first choice goalkeeper at Old Trafford which perhaps explains the lack of concrete interest from United for Donnarumma. Reports that United are not willing to pay £40m for Emi Martinez perhaps show evidence of a more sensible approach to transfer business. All this does make you wonder why United are not looking at bringing Aaron Ramsdale in on loan to provide good competition for Andre Onana.",
      "While this would not be a transfer for 2025, The Telegraph claims that Harry Kane is eyeing a return to the Premier League in 2026. United were interested in him back in 2023 when he moved to Bayern Munich but could not negotiate a deal with Tottenham.",
      "Kane is most likely eyeing Alan Shearer's record of 260 Premier League goals and a move closer to family as he turns 33 next year. It remains to be seen if United return to their interest in the striker.",
      "What MEN Sport says: On the surface, this is a signing that Ineos would not want any part of. An ageing player with no re-sale value.",
      "But, a player who Kane is often compared to is Robert Lewandowski and the Pole is still going strong at the age of 36 in La Liga. On a three-year deal, could Kane continue his lethal goalscoring prowess?",
      "That remains to be seen. But there is no doubting that he remains one of the best lone strikers in the world and would suit Ruben Amorim's system perfectly.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is set to outshine the outgoing talent at Manchester United, having emphasised the significance of his defensive contributions.",
      "Last week, United confirmed the signing of Mbeumo from Brentford in a transfer that could total £71million. The 25-year-old represents an electrifying boost to Ruben Amorim's squad, which was goal-shy last term.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals for the Bees in the previous season, demonstrating his knack for scoring. His remarkable speed promises to inject a fresh element into the Red Devils' forward line.",
      "However, it was during his appearance on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast that the Cameroonian international drew attention to another aspect of his game that likely influenced Amorim's eagerness to secure his services this summer: his commendable defensive efforts.",
      "When quizzed by United icon Ferdinand about his contributions to defence, Mbeumo responded: \"It's really important to attack and defend as a team.",
      "\"I think if just one of us doesn't defend, it makes space for the opponents and they can get through. It's really important to defend well as a team. Of course, it's easier to regain the ball [that way] as well.\"",
      "His focus on defence is a marked departure from the forwards who have struggled under Amorim since his appointment in November. Antony, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are three members of United's so-called 'bomb squad' this summer, reports the Mirror.",
      "They were all instructed to seek new clubs at the start of the summer and made to train separately from the first team, with Rashford leaving for Barcelona last week on a season-long loan deal.",
      "While discipline issues and poor form also played a part in the decision by United's management to let these players go, all three, along with returning loanee Jadon Sancho, have been criticised for their lacklustre defensive efforts in the past.",
      "Much of Amorim's success at Sporting CP, where he clinched two league titles, was built on solid defensive work and aggressive ball recovery high up the pitch, with press traps leading to swift transitions to attack.",
      "This is partly why the Portuguese coach relied so heavily on Amad last season compared to some of United's more flamboyant forward options. The Ivorian recorded more tackles, duels and recoveries than Rashford and Garnacho, while rewarding Amorim's faith by netting 11 goals and providing 10 assists in all competitions.",
      "Under the defensively-minded Thomas Frank at Brentford, Mbeumo was certainly no slouch either. He covered more ground than any other forward in the league last season, as well as delivering the most crosses (202) and the most expected assists (9.3).",
      "His commitment to exerting effort in both attack and defence will be a welcome sound not only to Amorim but also to United's supporters, who have previously voiced their dissatisfaction with players such as Rashford for his perceived lack of defensive contribution.",

      "20) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon, but the Bees have shown they are no pushovers.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Juventus\nThe Old Lady are the latest to throw their hat in the ring for Nunez, who was previously a target for Napoli. Liverpool have been keen to sell the Uruguayan striker for a while, but they are even more eager now that Alexander Isak is available. It doesn’t alter the fact that neither Juve nor Milan can afford what Liverpool are hoping to get.",

Guehi to Liverpool could accelerate following Luis Diaz’s transfer to Bayern, apparently. The Crystal Palace captain’s “heart is set” on a move to Anfield, says the ex-Manchester United chief scout, who remains very well-connected within the game. FI’s words, not ours.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Borussia Dortmund\nThe Gunners man is on Dortmund’s list of winger targets, with Jadon Sancho also under consideration. Arsenal could reinvest some of the money into Rodrygo, which means their supporters are bang up for this.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "14) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "11) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nThis rumour is a re-entry into the top 20 amid reports Sesko is one of two names on United’s striker shortlist. The Red Devils could be helped by talk of a gentleman’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko that he could go for £60million to one of a select few clubs, which United are among. But Newcastle are not. And one suspects Leipzig might change their tune when Newcastle are trying to throw at them whatever Isak money there might be. For United’s sake, we hope Sesko got something in writing.",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one has picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. We could see this happening, but not quickly. Some reports suggest Watkins is the first choice, but others say director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who worked at RB Leipzig, is pushing for Sesko.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",
      "",
      "6) Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle and Liverpool are currently at a stand-off, with Isak in the middle. Newcastle have received no bid yet, and the Reds are holding fire, knowing that time only increases the pressure on the Magpies. They are still intent on digging in, even if it means convincing Isak to stay for one more season, but if the Swede is certain he wants to go now, he needs to hope Liverpool’s desire matches his own. Given Isak left it so late to declare his wishes and Liverpool have already signed a striker in his place, it is easy to imagine this being kicked down the road until next summer. For now we wait until Liverpool show their hand.",
      "",
      "2)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Some reports suggest a deal has already been done. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "1) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, Ramsdale is having a medical on Thursday before the Toon pay £4million to borrow him for the season with the option of a more permanent arrangement.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has revealed the next signing that the Premier League giants need to make after landing Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "So far this summer, the Red Devils have only made three signings as they have spent around £130m to land Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are good signings for Man Utd, but they have loads of business still to do during this summer’s transfer window.",
      "The lack of exits are impacting Ruben Amorim‘s side and limiting their business as Marcus Rashford is their only high-profile departure, while Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho remain contracted to the Premier League giants.",
      "This is deterring pursuits for their remaining key targets, with reports indicating that their remaining priorities are a striker, a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "Neville has commented on United’s business and picked out the signing they “need” next. He has also revealed his feelings on his former side’s prospects next season.",
      "“Yeah, [United’s transfer business] could be a bigger challenge than the economy… I think the two signings are good signings yet, there’s a couple more needed,” Neville said on Sky News’ Business Live.",
      "READ: Romano reveals ‘private agreement’ for Sesko as Man Utd ‘deal is on’ for Newcastle target",
      "“I think they need a goalkeeper. And I think if they fill those two positions with decent signings, then United can have a lot, I mean, they have to have a better season than last year. It can’t get any worse, really.”",
      "Ex-Premier League striker Emile Heskey recently claimed one Man Utd goalkeeper target is “closest” to a former Red Devils shot-stopper.",
      "“He’s got the presence to play for Manchester United. And he’s very confident. Whoever goes into Man United, you have to have some serious presence. You have to have some serious belief in yourself,” Heskey claimed.",
      "“And I think he’s got that because the pressure is going to be on from day dot, because when you look at Onana, his confidence is on the floor.",
      "“Whoever comes in next, they have to hit the ground running. Emi is an interesting character, and you’d need to be that to take on a challenge like United right now.",
      "“He’s probably the closest goalkeeper in attitude to Fabien Barthez, and you need that. It’s a huge club, absolutely massive. He’s won the World Cup, he’s played with Lionel Messi, so he’s well suited as far as we can tell.",
      "“We won’t know for sure until and unless he moves, because we’ve seen goalkeepers crumble in minutes, like Massimo Taibi, with the pressure of United. They make a few mistakes and then you never see them again.",
      "“The only reason that’s not happened to Onana yet is because their other keepers are no better than him. If you can’t look to your number two at all to take the pressure off, then there’s a huge issue there.”",
      "Man Utd have been handed a golden opportunity to sign the Champions League star Gary Neville said was ‘unbelievable’ this season for a cut-price fee.",
      "Gary Neville has “doubled down” on his previous Premier League title predictions and once again forecast Arsenal as next year’s winners.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has told Arsenal that they “have to be on a podium” next season as he told the club which trophy they “need” to win.",

      "Mbeumo told Rio Ferdinand on the Man Utd legend’s YouTube channel: “Ollie is a complete striker, he can do a lot of things. He can drop to be available or go in behind.",
      "“That is really good for me as a winger because you can use his pace to fit in there. Plus he can combine as well. It’s really good.”",
      "Speaking about his move to Man Utd, Mbeumo added: “You want to play on the greatest stages in the world. And Old Trafford is one of them,’ he said of his move to United, who finished just 15th in the Premier League last season.",
      "“So being able to play here every two weeks is just big.  When I spoke properly with the gaffer, he said “we are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team”, and of course that’s what we will try to do.",
      "“We had a very friendly and constructive conversation. He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, and they have form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "We know these days that players are on the wrong side of the hill once they leave school, but some oldies have shown there’s still life (and goals) in the old dogs once they sign for Manchester United later in their careers.",
      "Watkins is 29, he is said to be the preferred choice of the two names on their shortlist, and he would certainly be an upgrade on what the Red Devils currently have up front. Even though he is pushing 30, that didn’t stop these permanent striker signings from making a big impact at Old Trafford…",
      "",
      "Edinson Cavani\nFew United fans cared that Cavani was 33 when he joined United amid the madness of Covid times. For free, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signed PSG’s then record goalscorer with a tally of 200 in 301 games. It was a much-needed boost a few days after being humped 6-1 at Old Trafford by Tottenham.",
      "Cavani took on the No.7 shirt and made a better fist of living up to its iconic billing than anyone else since the first coming of Ronaldo. Helping United to a runners-up finish in the Premier League – an achievement only recognised in hindsight – the Uruguayan scored 10 league goals and 17 in all competitions, despite having to come off the bench almost as often as he started.",
      "Signing a new one-year contract, Cavani could be forgiven for thinking he had done enough to be trusted to lead United’s line. But then, the second coming. Not only did Ronaldo take the starting spot Cavani wanted; he took the shirt of his back too.",
      "Now 34, Cavani seemed to take it all rather personally. For Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, his appearances were sporadic and his goals even more so. He was hardly alone in going through the motions for Rangnick, but the desire to get out of Old Trafford was more thinly disguised than most.",
      "",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo\nYes, it all came to a rather unsavoury end, but Ronaldo’s return didn’t seem such a bad idea when he finished the 2021/22 season as the club’s top scorer with 24 goals in 38 appearances, including some big moments in a generally wretched campaign.",
      "Granted, it wasn’t hard to shine in a team that got Solskjaer sacked and barely bothered to tune in to Rangnick, the interim replacement. He didn’t do much in the way of pressing, but what did anyone expect? Especially while he was surrounded by younger pretend pressers, who made Rangnick rip up his philosophy after approximately 45 minutes of his first match in charge.",
      "Top scorer and Player of the Season in his first year back at Old Trafford, Erik ten Hag’s appointment got Ronaldo’s back up. He was picked to start just once in the new manager’s first eight Premier League games, a role never compatible with Ronaldo’s ego.",
      "Rather than keep things in-house to preserve his legacy, Ronaldo took a scorched earth approach to manufacturing an exit. He sat down with Piers Morgan to criticise, well, everything. He wasn’t wrong about many things, but the inevitable mutual consent was reached to allow Ronaldo to move into semi-retirement in Saudi.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nIbra may have been 34 when he strutted into Old Trafford for a reunion with Jose Mourinho, but there were few signs of the veteran slowing down. He joined United on the back of his most prolific season ever in which he bagged 50 goals in 51 appearances for PSG.",
      "Zlatan was… Zlatan. He was United’s top scorer with 27 goals, netting at crucial times during Jose’s Aldi Treble. He would have scored more had his season not been brought to a premature end by a serious knee injury with a month still to go.",
      "The injury delayed the signing of another one-year contract, but by the time Ibrahimovic was fit, United had signed Romelu Lukaku, who took his starting place and his No.9 shirt. Hardly suited to a stand-in role, Zlatan was allowed to leave Old Trafford in March to join LA Galaxy. But his first season in red is one of pitifully few fond memories for United fans in recent years.",
      "",
      "Robin van Persie\nThere’s a theme among these veteran strikers: brilliant in their first season; far less so after that.",
      "None of the above, though, were as inspiring as Van Persie in his maiden campaign at Old Trafford. He did have the advantage of playing for Sir Alex Ferguson, but even accounting for that, the Netherlands striker’s impact was almost Cantona-esque.",
      "In the wake of losing the title to Manchester City, signing Van Persie from Arsenal was a statement in itself, with City also interested in the Gunners skipper once he identified Arsene Wenger’s side were going nowhere fast. ‘The little boy inside was screaming for United’, as Van Persie put it, so Fergie made sure he got there ahead of his noisy neighbours.",
      "It was decisive in United wrestling back control of Manchester and the Premier League, albeit briefly. Van Persie, evidently born to play at Old Trafford, scored 26 league goals to claim the Golden Boot as well as his first title.",
      "Then, to Van Persie’s horror as much as anyone else’s, Ferguson retired. He still hit double figures for David Moyes and Louis van Gaal in the following two seasons, but the onset of the post-Fergie funk was as a swift as it is stubborn to shift. “Moyes was not to blame – anyone who came in after Ferguson, good luck to you,” said Van Persie after he retired. “It was not only him to blame, it was us as well. The standards were so high but they dropped.”",
      "",
      "Teddy Sheringham\nBucking the trend somewhat, Sheringham struggled badly in his first season at Old Trafford. But it all worked out rather well in the end…",
      "Sheringham signed up for the impossible job: replacing Eric Cantona. At 31, the England striker was a year older than the retiring United skipper who left impossibly big boots to fill.",
      "It probably didn’t help that he barely spoke to his new strike partner Andy Cole. He failed to hit double figures in the league, which was relinquished to Arsenal. So when Ferguson signed Cole’s best mate at the start of the following season, the writing looked to be on the wall.",
      "Sheringham played in fewer than half of the Premier League games as United regained their title, scoring only twice, but the veteran scored career-defining goals off the bench in the FA Cup final and Champions League final to make himself a hero of the Treble.",
      "Even his third season at Old Trafford was a personal struggle – he scored six goals in all competitions. It was only at the fourth attempt, aged 35, that he bagged double figures in the league (15) while breaking the 20-goal barrier in all competitions for the first time, winning the PFA Player of the Year along the way.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is “not really worried” about the Red Devils being linked to Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘exploring’ an ‘innovative solution’ to offload Alejandro Garnacho as they eye three key signings.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has revealed who he would prefer his former club to sign out of Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko.",

Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",

      "7) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "6) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",

      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

The second thing to note is that he is a Football News Correspondent for a reason; he should never have been allowed (physically restrain him if necessary) to write another opinion piece ever again after this monstrosity.",
      "It’s worth taking a minute to look again at that column – in the Sunday Mirror – from 2012. In no particular order of our three favourite passages in Law’s raging against the scourge of reverse xenophobia we bring you…",
      "The way he juggles selling star players with bringing through youth and picking up bargains makes Moyes the perfect eventual successor to Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "United too should look at Moyes when Sir Alex Ferguson calls it a day, but no doubt the likes of Mourinho, Guardiola and Klopp will be at the top of the hit lists.",
      "That’s nothing less than beautiful, even without the knowledge of what happened a literal year later. Next…",

      "That should sound alarm bells ringing in the head of Watkins if it has been turned in the direction of Old Trafford at all. Just as in the case of City and Kane, there is no conviction to United’s supposed interest. It must be assumed that the club are either trying to please Amorim or simply view Watkins as being better than nothing.",

      "Man Utd are “going to have to get moving” if they want to beat Newcastle in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer, according to transfer journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "The Red Devils have already brought in new attacking talents in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has also joined from Cerro Porteno.",
      "Man Utd have been trying to move some of their ‘bomb squad’ on this summer with Marcus Rashford the main player to have departed after he completed a move to Barcelona last week.",
      "The Red Devils are still trying to move on Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia in order to raise some much-needed funds for more incomings.",
      "A new striker is top of their agenda, while they also want to bring in a goalkeeper and defensive midfielder, and RB Leipzig striker Sesko is one of two players Man Utd are chasing.",
      "Sesko and Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins have risen to the top of their list with a meeting being held this week to determine whether the Red Devils can afford an expensive move for the Slovenia international.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour ranking: Man Utd’s striker preference amid Donnarumma talk",
      "But transfer journalist Jacobs has warned Man Utd that they need to get on with it as Newcastle are “advanced” in discussions to land Sesko with “club-to-club talks” taking place.",
      "Jacobs told talkSPORT: “If Manchester United want Sesko, they’re going to have to be quicker than for Ollie Watkins because Newcastle are advanced on the player’s side, they’re in club-to-club talks, they’re ready to bid.",
      "“Manchester United are still have internal conversations and as a consequence, their outreach for both Watkins and Sesko is still formative.",
      "“But I get the impression that this is a big week in the pursuit of a number nine because if it’s Sesko, Man United are going to have to get moving. If we hear a bit of a lull, it probably means they’re looking for proven Premier League experience.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand isn’t convinced that Sesko is the answer to the Red Devils’ goalscoring problems and would prefer Watkins from Premier League rivals Aston Villa.",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel on Tuesday: “If you get Watkins, you’ve got guaranteed 15-20 goals really and then you’ve got that with Cunha and you’ve got that with Mbeumo.",
      "“Not completely guaranteed, but you’ve got double figures all the way up front.",
      "“Bear in mind, we were 16th in terms of goals scored last season and these lot are getting you minimum 40 goals between them.”",
      "Speaking about his “worry” about Sesko, Ferdinand continued: “The only difference is that Rasmus [Hojlund] came in and had inexperience around him in terms of [Alejandro] Garnacho one side and Amad [Diallo] the other, for instance, most of the time.",
      "“If Sesko comes in, he’s got two players that have played Premier League, scored goals in the Premier League and backed up by Bruno [Fernandes] so I think it’s a different dynamic that he comes into.",
      "“But the uncertainty worries me a little bit. Can he adapt to this league?”",
      "Ferdinand added “I wanted a striker with experience so he wouldn’t be my first-choice, obviously, even now.",
      "“But if Manchester United buy him and Newcastle go and get a number nine, does that mean [Alexander] Isak stays at Newcastle and Liverpool don’t get Isak?",

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) James Trafford – £27m/€31.2m (Burnley to Manchester City, July 2025)\nBurnley are claiming that they have sold Trafford for a British record fee for a goalkeeper but City sources place the deal at £27m plus add-ons. Newcastle were willing to pay that sum but, not for the first time, their lure was far less than City’s.",
      "",
      "12) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "13) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "14) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "15) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "16) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "17) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "18) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "19) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "20) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",

      "Manchester United have received a blow in their desire to offload Antony, though there is fresh interest in another expensive flop, according to reports.",
      "Antony has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in recent days after a fruitful six-month loan at Real Betis.",
      "The Brazilian winger joined United from Ajax for around £85million in August 2022 and has failed to live up to the hefty price tag. However, his form during the second half of last season has raised the player’s value ahead of a summer sale.",
      "Betis want to keep Antony but are struggling to match the 25-year-old’s wage demands. He currently earns £105,000 a week at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils have so far failed in their attempts to shift all of their unwanted high earners, with the exception of new Barcelona loan signing Marcus Rashford.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all surplus to requirements, with Ruben Amorim eager to move them on and reinvest in new signings.",
      "The club have signed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £127.5m but Amorim wants a new centre-forward, and potentially a midfielder and goalkeeper — though the latter is contingent on Andre Onana leaving.",
      "It was reported by Foot Mercato on Monday that Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr — captained by United legend Cristiano Ronaldo — have made an opening offer for Antony.",
      "Meanwhile, a fresh report from Antenados states that Antony has ‘rejected’ offers from Brazilian clubs Sao Paulo and Botafogo.",
      "Indeed, the former Ajax forward has ‘ruled out’ a return to his homeland in the summer transfer window.",
      "It’s confirmed that Antony ‘is not in United’s plans next season’ but Sao Paulo ‘demonstrating interest’ will not sway him, with the Serie A side receiving a ‘negative result’.",
      "It’s added that clubs in the Middle East are interested but there’s no mention of the aforementioned Al Nassr ‘offer’.",
      "Another player who could leave United this summer is Rasmus Hojlund, who is not a part of Amorim’s bomb squad alongside Antony, Sancho, Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Hojlund joined the Premier League giants from Atalanta in the 2023 summer window and has been strongly linked with a return to the Italian Serie A in recent months.",
      "According to Italian outlet Calciomercato, Hojlund’s former Atalanta head coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, is keen on reuniting at AS Roma, who the veteran boss took charge of at the end of 2024/25.",
      "The report claims that Artem Dovbyk’s uncertain future could open the door for the arrival of the 22-year-old Danish international.",
      "Calciomercato states:",
      "In the event of a Dovbyk transfer, Roma would attempt to bring Rasmus Hojlund back to Italy. The 2003-born Danish striker has a contract with Manchester United until June 2028 (plus an option for another season) worth €3 million net per year.",
      "His name had also been linked on the market with other Italian clubs such as Inter (before the explosion of Pio Esposito, the arrival of Bonny from Parma and the negotiations for Lookman from Atalanta), Napoli (before the arrival of Lucca from Udinese), Juventus (as an alternative to Kolo Muani and Darwin Nunez) and Milan (as an alternative to Vlahovic).",
      "Hojlund has only scored 26 goals in 95 matches for United, while Antony has only recorded 17 goal involvements in 96 appearances.",
      "Antony has turned down two offers to move away from Man Utd as he has his heart set on a transfer to Real Betis this summer, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim’s ‘decision’ on Rasmus Hojlund has reportedly sparked his desire to ‘return to his former club’.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr have reportedly made an ‘offer’ to Man Utd for Antony as Cristiano Ronaldo’s team ‘continue to explore Europe’.",
      "Man Utd could use Rasmus Hojlund to ‘compensate’ Juventus if they beat them to Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani, according to reports.",
      "We’ve analysed the Man Utd first-team squad and decided who should be kept, sold, or loaned out before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a final decision on whether to offload Rasmus Hojlund this summer amid two key factors."

      "Manchester United have whittled down their striker shortlist to two: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko. Tell us who they should they sign…",
      "United have spent around £133million on adding some creativity to their attack but still they lack a top-class centre-forward.",
      "They have been linked with a variety of names through the summer, including Viktor Gyokeres and Dusan Vlahovic, but reports suggest there are only two names on their wishlist.",
      "One is Ollie Watkins. The Aston Villa forward is seen as proven Premier League quality and he is likely to be the cheaper of the two options.",
      "Arsenal were quoted £60million when they enquired over Watkins in January, but United reportedly believe there is a deal to be done at around £45million.",
      "The cheapest price for which they might get Benjamin Sesko out of RB Leipzig is around £60million. That is said to be the agreement between the Bundesliga club and the giant striker if a select few clubs of Sesko’s choosing make a move. United are said to be among them.",
      "Did Sesko get that agreement in writing? Because with Newcastle seemingly eyeing the Slovenian as a possible replacement for Alexander Isak, Leipzig are almost certain to do what they can to get closer to what they feel is their striker’s real value – around £75million.",

      "Of course it might all be irrelevant if United cannot raise the funds for either.",
      "It seems they must sell to buy and though Marcus Rashford is out from under Ruben Amorim’s feet – for this season at least – there are still four members of the ‘bomb squad’ to park elsewhere.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s price continues to fall, with United looking for £15million to £17million. Juventus and, once again, Dortmund are interested, but both would be wise to sit tight and wait for United to get even more desperate.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was seen as the most sellable asset but, again, there is no bidding war. Perhaps there is a way to use Villa’s interest in the winger to grease the wheels of a deal for Watkins but reports suggest Garnacho is content to sit tight until the end of the window when his options could be increased by United’s eagerness to be rid.",
      "The Saudi interest in Antony could do United a huge favour, especially since Real Betis have strung the Red Devils along all summer with seemingly no intention of paying a fee for the Brazilian.",

      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has emerged as Man Utd's top target with club holding initial talks over conditions of a deal; Newcastle also interested but Sesko thought to prefer Man Utd move",
      "Wednesday 30 July 2025 18:12, UK",
      "Manchester United have held initial talks with RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old has emerged as a top target for Manchester United in this window if they sign a striker.",
      "Exploratory talks have also been held with Sesko's representatives and it is understood that while Manchester United are keen to sign him, it will not be a simple deal to do financially.",
      "Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought - as it stands - Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.",
      "The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.",
      "United's interest in Sesko is long-standing - they have been keeping an eye on his development for a number of years.",
      "While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.",
      "Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "However, the prices and structure for those players have been deemed too high at this stage.",
      "While Sesko would cost more than Watkins overall, it's thought a more favourable structure could be struck with Leipzig.",
      "Sesko has a gentleman's agreement in place with Leipzig and they will not stand in his way should an appropriate offer arrive.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford? And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",

      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford?",

      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "Like Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, Sesko could help add counter-attacking threat to a Manchester United side that only scored four fast-break goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness might be part of his appeal to Manchester United.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "It is likely another part of his appeal to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to Old Trafford would bring considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United."

      "Wednesday 30 July 2025 17:09, UK",
      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any \"stragglers\" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.",
      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",
      "Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.",
      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",
      "While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I can't be any worse than it was last season,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",
      "\"I'm enjoying that. Aims-wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I know people will be questioning me for saying that after last season, but it has to be that. It's not just me who thinks that. I'm sure the whole team, if you ask them, they all have the same aims.",
      "\"Even the manager, I'm sure he probably wouldn't say it in the press, but we all have to have the same beliefs and ambitions. Like I said, that real family feeling together, and we all strive for the same thing.\"",
      "Since Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, he has overseen a period of change to the squad with some understood to be allowed to leave this summer.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof left the club upon the expiry of their contracts at the end of June, while Jonny Evans announced his retirement, taking up a role in United's academy.",
      "Marcus Rashford, who was also training away from the main squad after returning from a six-month loan spell at Aston Villa this summer, has secured a loan move to Barcelona, which includes an option to buy for the LaLiga side.",
      "After Rashford's departure, United continue to work on exits for Sancho, Antony and Malacia - as well as Garnacho.",
      "Manchester United are focusing on sales, but work continues behind the scenes around the potential recruitment of a striker.",
      "United have been in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future amid interest in him from Italy.",
      "Work has been done to explore potential deals for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is another player the club have looked at, but Chelsea's valuation of the striker is understood to be considered far too high.",
      "United have approached Villa about Watkins, who they have a long-standing interest in.",
      "However, Villa do not want to sell and he is thought to carry a value of around £60m.",
      "The interest in Sesko is understood to be driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who signed the striker as a 16-year-old for Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "Gary Neville has backed Ruben Amorim's overhaul of the Man Utd squad, including the summer signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is identifying players he does not want in the squad and moving them out. That's a positive,\" Neville told Sky News.",
      "\"The second thing is I do like are the signing of [Mathues] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got Premier League experience.",
      "\"They look more like Manchester United's style of players, with a bit more pace and power, and that physicality to get from box to box.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two is they've not proved themselves at the highest level in the game so they should be really desperate to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.",
      "\"The two signings are good signings yet there's a couple more needed. I think they need a goalkeeper. They need to sign a forward.",
      "\"They have to have a better season than last year. It can't get any worse really.\"",

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",

      "Villa have been keen on Alejandro Garnacho - a player United want to sell - but they are understood to be unable to meet their current asking price to buy him outright.",
      "Garnacho's preference is to remain in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, but no such move has yet materialised despite some interest from Chelsea.",

      "Two Saudi Pro League clubs interested in Man Utd's Antony; a return to Real Betis, where he spent last season, unlikely at this stage; Bayer Leverkusen reunion with former boss Erik ten Hag also appears to be off the table",
      "Friday 25 July 2025 08:45, UK",
      "Two of the Saudi Pro League's top clubs are understood to be interested in signing Antony from Manchester United.",
      "A move to Real Betis - where he spent last season on loan - is looking unrealistic at this stage of the window and the winger wants to take his time to choose his next move.",
      "A number of other clubs from across Europe, including Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich, have been monitoring his situation.",
      "However, Bayern's priority is a left-winger rather than a right-winger, and Leverkusen boss Erik ten Hag - who signed him an £86m deal for United in 2022 - has been quoted in Germany saying \"we are not interested at the moment\".",
      "Ten Hag also stated: \"we'll see what happens in the future,\" which may be an indication of the financial parameters set by United to buy him.",
      "Antony thrived at Betis but they cannot afford a permanent deal as things stand and are hoping for the chance to discuss another loan.",
      "The winger scored nine goals and made five more for team-mates in 26 appearances.",
      "United prefer a permanent sale but bids are yet to materialise and only Leverkusen and Betis are thought to have contacted them so far.",
