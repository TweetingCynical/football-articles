      "Bayer Leverkusen are reportedly considering an offer to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho in the summer transfer window. Sancho is facing yet another uncertain summer after spending the season on loan with Chelsea, but could be offered a new escape route back to Germany.",
      "United are desperate to sell Sancho and fellow outcasts Marcus Rashford, Antony and Tyrell Malacia once the window opens. The club need to raise funds for a major squad rebuild and their loanees represent the most obvious route, although they are willing to listen to offers for any of their players.",
      "Sancho has not set the world alight during his time at Chelsea, returning just three goals and five assists in 30 Premier League appearances this season. The Blues have the option to sign the 25-year-old on a permanent deal this summer for £25million, and while likely, that is not set in stone.",
      "United would be due £5m if Chelsea backed out of the deal, yet The Independent reports that they are yet to decide either way. The club will assess their options once the season is over, with their full focus currently on the final game of the season, against Nottingham Forest on Sunday, when they can rubber-stamp a place in the Champions League.",
      "That uncertainty has prompted Leverkusen to come forward, with the German club keeping an eye on how the situation develops. Leverkusen are braced for a summer of upheaval, with manager Xabi Alonso heading to Real Madrid and Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz both potentially joining Liverpool.",
      "With Wirtz valued at £120m, the German side could be flush with cash to rebuild once the window opens. They reportedly believe that they can provide Sancho with the perfect environment to rediscover his best, having seen just how good he can be during his time at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho has 40 goals and 47 assists in 118 appearances for Dortmund and retains a strong reputation in Germany. Were he to move to Leverkusen, he would be reunited with Erik ten Hag, who is in pole position to replace Alonso.",
      "After interest in Como’s Cesc Fabregas, Leverkusen are ready to appoint Ten Hag on a two-year contract. The Dutchman is looking to revive his career after being sacked by United in October – and he might not be keen on the signing of Sancho.",
      "Ten Hag famously fell out with Sancho after publicly calling out his level in training – an accusation which led to a spat with the winger. It was Ten Hag who forced Sancho to re-join Dortmund on loan in January 2024 and there was a frosty reintroduction in United’s pre-season last summer."

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez has shed some light on his post-playing career injury woes, admitting he is \"broken\". The French shot-stopper caught the eye of Sir Alex Ferguson with his Euro 2000 performance, and was brought in from Monaco for a hefty £7.8million in an attempt to fill the gloves of the departed Peter Schmeichel.",
      "A stellar start earned Barthez plaudits at Old Trafford. He secured a Premier League title in his debut season and swiftly caught the affection of fans for his eccentric and risky style. However, despite his brilliance, things didn't go smoothly for too long.",
      "Though he won another top-flight crown in 2003, Barthez was dropped towards the end of that campaign in favour of Roy Carroll after a string of poor performances, and Tim Howard was brought in to take his place in the long term, with Ferguson's faith in him lost.",
      "After being told United would release him, he left for Marseille on an initial loan deal halfway through the following season and played out the rest of his days on the pitch in France for Les Olympiens and Nantes.",
      "Barthez would retire in 2006 at the age of 36, having won a World Cup and Champions League to go with his Euros title and Red Devils silverware, although such a successful and lengthy career didn't come without its share of bumps and bruises.",
      "Now, the Frenchman has decided to illuminate the gruelling injury-related ordeals he and many of his fellow pros endured during their playing days, even stating that there were many occasions he wrongly played through injury.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe, the former Red Devils goalkeeper came clean about his injury troubles, admitting: \"When I get up, I feel like an old man.",
      "\"When you've been diving all day in every direction from age 15 to 36, you shouldn't be surprised. But hey, I'm not the only one. We are all broken.\"",
      "Barthez, now aged 53, went on to single out some of the occasions when injuries got the better of him and he perhaps should not have carried on playing while stricken. In doing so, he is now suffering the side effects each and every day.",
      "\"In my time, we weren't protected,\" he added. \"There were times I played when I really shouldn't have. In Monaco, I fractured my cheekbone.",
      "\"I was supposed to play again three weeks later, but they put me back on the field immediately with a protective shell. Now I suffer the consequences, but without regrets.",
      "\"On one occasion, during a match, I suffered a very strong blow. At half-time, my thigh had doubled its size. The doctor told me to stop, but I said I felt fine.",
      "\"As a result, I spent the night in the emergency room; they split my thigh in two, and I was off for two months,\" he concluded. \"I am the one to blame.\"",

      "Garnacho has been linked with both Napoli and Chelsea over recent months. Meanwhile, Marcus Rashford is also expected to leave permanently after his loan spell at Aston Villa. United have put a £40m price tag on the forward.",
      "And while the pair would represent pure profit from a PSR standpoint, the same cannot be said of Rasmus Hojlund and Antony. The pair have failed to hit expectations at Old Trafford following big-money switches and it now appears they could be sold for far less than signed for.",

      "Despite being signed for a huge £88m, it appears that he could be sold for as low as £25m. Antony has actually impressed during a loan spell with Real Betis but it appears unlikely that the Spanish side will be able to afford a permanent deal.",
      "Who should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments",
      "Club president Angel Haro said recently: “His name was put on the table by the sporting director. It was a low-priced approach because Manchester United assumed almost all the salary. The player wanted to come to Betis. It was a pure loan, it was very cheap for Betis and there was no option to negotiate anything.",
      "“Keeping Antony is very, very complicated. We will have a meeting with Manchester United to extend the loan for another year, to be able to share a percentage of the player… It’s about seeing the predisposition of the player and Manchester United.",
      "“The first filter is put by Manchester United, and then the negotiation of the player would come, but that is a long way off. In addition, now the player is plugged in wanting to lift a title with Betis. When the time comes and the season is over, he will be able to do his part if this option opens up.”"

However, a new ownership group has bought them out after Lim's departure last summer, though the collective of other ex-Red Devils will still be involved with the club \"across technical, football, commercial, recruitment and the SCFC foundation.\"",

      "\"Me and Becks [David Beckham] decided that we would put money in for the next four or five years, which is a commitment we've all made. There's been quite a lot of money been promised over the next four years,\" admitted Neville, speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"[But] we won't change the budget, and to reverse out of the model we already have, you need two or three years. You can't just go from investing to becoming sustainable – you've got players' contracts for three years, and you've generally got a model that you've built which you can't get away from.",

      "“What I saw was a manager whose will to win filtered down no matter what it takes,” he says. “The late goals were unbelievable. People called it Fergie Time but it was a pure belief that we were going to win.",
      "“If you wanted to play football, he’d out-football you. If you wanted to fight and scrap against him, he’d have a fighter. The mentality they had. Football ’s a bit different now, back then they could kick you, but they left an imprint on me.”",
      "Still, he is more than aware how much has changed since those infamous days when young players at the training ground would be locked into tumble dryers and skips. “It was brutal but back then it was the norm. Would I have changed it? Not at all, not a little bit.”",
      "That his own sons - Charlie, recently released by Reading, and Alfie, at Orient - are charting their own paths informs his thinking further. “Would I like to seem treated how I was when I was 16 or 17? No,” Wellens admits.",
      "“But it put me in a position where I could play for 20-odd years and now I can be a manager and no matter what anybody throws at me it doesn’t affect me because I’m quite strong-minded and resilient. Maybe I built that up over a period of time.”",
      "When he took his first job in management - at Oldham in 2017 - Wellens was afraid to call Ferguson up for advice. But when he guided Salford City to the EFL Trophy in 2021, a congratulatory text arrived.",
      "Is he hoping for another one on Sunday afternoon? \"It'd be nice,\" he says. \"He's the best Britain has ever produced.\""

      "It comes after it was announced last year that Gary Lineker would be stepping down from his iconic role after 26 years in the chair at the end of this season. The BBC’s plan was that Lineker, 64, would still host the broadcaster’s coverage of the FA Cup next season and the 2026 World Cup.",
      "But those plans were scrapped as the former England striker bowed out by mutual agreement on Sunday, leaving his role and the BBC at the conclusion of this season this weekend. The announcement came in light of the huge backlash against Lineker after he reposted a video on social media which criticised Zionism and included an illustration of a rat.",
      "Chapman, Logan and Cates were initially meant to have supporting roles alongside him at his swansong in next summer’s World Cup, which will take place in the US, Canada and Mexico. But his departure means the BBC now need to find a lead replacement for the tournament, with the aforementioned trio believed to be the key names in the running.",
      "It is also possible that they could rotate in the role of lead presenter, though only one of them can present the highly coveted World Cup and FA Cup finals. Chapman, 51, will slot in seamlessly if selected, having anchored BBC Two's sister football highlights show Match of the Day 2 since August 2013.",
      "His professionalism cannot be questioned either, with the majority of football fans still in the dark over which football team Chapman supports after all these years. However, Chapman, who grew up in Sale, Greater Manchester, has been open in the past about being a fan of Premier League giants Manchester United.",
      "The way he avoids showing favouritism is testament to his impartiality, though he recently joked that he hides his true feelings by venting all frustrations about the Red Devils’ dire form and poor results before going on air.",
      "During his appearance on Catchphrase earlier this month, Chapman revealed: “By the time we go on air, I’ve had enough time to stop being a sore loser. So by then I’m fairly impartial.”",
      "Chapman began his career at the BBC as a continuity announcer doing voice-overs between programmes before spells as a local cricket reporter and doing “jokey stuff” on Radio 1 for nearly a decade. He has since become one of the most recognisable faces – and voices – in British sports broadcasting after joining 5 Live and taking over as presenter of the weekly MOTD2.",
      "Chapman was born in Rochdale but moved to Sale at a young age. United were and are still his local team.",
      "“It’s not my fault that I support a big team!” he told the iPaper in 2018. Chapman went on to add authenticity to his claim that he’s not a ‘glory hunter’ by saying: “I had to put up with a lot of poor, if at least entertaining, stuff in the 1980s. I am a genuine Manchester United fan.”",
      "It is understood that BBC executives, headed by new director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski, are eager to move the show in a fresh direction with the appointment of Logan, Chapman and Cates.",
      "When asked what to expect from MOTD in the 2025/26 season, Chapman, whose appointment was announced in January, insisted: “Nothing different. I know people keep saying, ‘Oh this will change or that will change.’ I genuinely don't think anything will change.",
      "“It will still be showing all the highlights and having a bit of a chat. So, if you're wanting a lot of change, I suppose you're going to be a bit disappointed by it.",
      "“I think we are still just going to do the same thing and talk about football and have a laugh and that will be that.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "“Of course there is a lot of interest – and rightly so. I think part of his week has been having some of those conversations.",
      "“It looks more likely than not that he will move on this summer and he has interest from pretty much every club in the league, and I don’t think there are many clubs in the world who wouldn’t want to have him.",
      "“(However) nothing is sorted, nothing is done or completed or even very, very, very close, so that process will take its course.”",
      "McKenna added: “We will be proud of the part that we have had in terms of Liam’s development and his contribution this season.",
      "“If he stays with us, we will be delighted, and if he moves on this summer, it will be a positive sign for the club to have developed and sold a player at that sort of level and hopefully it will be a good move for him as well.”",
      "Delap has scored 12 Premier League goals in 36 appearances this season, but that was not enough to see Ipswich avoid a swift return to the second tier.",
      "McKenna, though, believes Delap never showed anything other than full commitment to Town’s survival battle.",
      "“He has given everything to the cause and he is entitled to make a decision on what he thinks is best for the future,” the Ipswich boss said.",
      "“I think the supporters will look back in time ahead with great fondness to some of his performances and some of the victories he was involved in.",
      "“I really believe everyone will be following his career, if it isn’t at Ipswich, with the best of wishes.”",
      "McKenna confirmed midfielder Massimo Luongo will be leaving the club this summer at the end of his contract.",
      "Talks continue with defenders Cameron Burgess and Axel Tuanzebe over possibly extending their stay at Portman Road next season."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly told Bruno Fernandes they had to win the Premier League title after signing for Manchester United in 2021. Four years on, United are on track for their worst-ever finish in the Premier League - just two places above the relegation zone - without any European football next season and a squad desperately in need of revamping.",
      "Ronaldo made his sensational return to Old Trafford on transfer deadline day in August 2021, signing from Juventus for a fee of £12.86million. The return of the Portuguese legend, who had previously won a Ballon d'Or and three Premier League titles with the club, was greeted with great enthusiasm and hope.",
      "The Red Devils had just ended the previous season as runners-up under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and had already made exciting additions like Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane to the squad earlier that summer.",
      "The plan was that by adding one of the greatest goal-scorers of all time to their ranks, United would return to their glory days and secure their first league triumph since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013.",
      "As per The Sun, Ronaldo showed his winning mentality even before setting foot at United. He is said to have spoken to his Portugal team-mate Fernandes, instructing the midfielder to tell the rest of the United squad that they needed to have faith in themselves and win the title that year.",
      "For a multitude of reasons, the Red Devils under Ralf Rangnick finished the season in sixth place, 35 points behind champions Manchester City. Ronaldo's contract would be ripped up by the end of 2022 after being frozen out by Rangnick's successor, Erik ten Hag.",
      "The now 40-year-old then completed a stunning transfer to Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr, setting a trend for other ageing Premier League stars. Ten Hag's decision to part ways with the veteran forward was seemingly justified as he steered United back to a respectable third-place finish in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "However, since then, United have repeatedly hit new lows. A combination of poor recruitment and a mishmash of managers with differing philosophies has inflicted long-term damage on the club. And despite lifting the FA Cup in 2024, Ten Hag couldn't keep the sinking ship afloat and was sacked last October.",
      "Ruben Amorim, a fresh-faced and tactically innovative manager, fresh off winning the league with Portuguese side Sporting CP, was brought in soon after. But under the once jovial Portuguese head coach, the Red Devils have again set new unwanted records.",
      "Amorim has the distinction of having fewer points per game than any other United manager in the Premier League era, while also overseeing the most defeats, fewest victories and the lowest league tally in recent memory. The only silver lining was if he could have ended a disastrous season with some silverware and secured a Champions League spot by defeating Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "As it transpired, United's two biggest weaknesses - their blunt attack and error-prone goalkeeper - would result in them losing 1-0 to Spurs, who had not won a trophy in 17 years prior to Wednesday night. Any sliver of optimism vanished in Bilbao, and it was unclear how things could get any worse.",
      "That was, until, club captain Fernandes astonishingly offered to quit the club in his post-match interview. The 30-year-old, with at least two years still left on his contract, announced he is willing to leave if United bosses wish to cash in on him.",
      "\"I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" Fernandes began by saying. \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. On the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this. It's very sad. We wanted to win more than anything in this final. It's a very sad day because we've done some very good things in this competition until today.",
      "\"But today was the day that mattered, the most important day of the competition. It was the day we could have been in the history of the Europa League, but it's not like that. And football is cruel, and it's been our turn to lose.\"",
      "The Saudi outfit are participating in the tournament, which begins in the United States next month, and will be able to sign players from June 1.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Gareth Bale watched on with a smile as his old club Tottenham Hotspur lifted their first trophy in 17 years after defeating Manchester United. But the Welshman's story could have been very different had he not turned down the chance to join the Red Devils over the north London side.",
      "Almost two decades ago, a young Bale was catching eyes from full-back, scoring five goals and assisting 12 times across 45 appearances for then-Championship side Southampton. New Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was interested, but he faced stiff competition from Premier League giant Sir Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United boardroom.",
      "Bale decided to turn down Ferguson, though, and head to north London in 2007 instead, telling his Airwayz channel in 2023 that this decision actually led to his success rather than any potential downfall.",
      "The 35-year-old said: \"I rejected Manchester United and went to Tottenham. At that time, United were the biggest team in the league, they were winning trophies, they had the biggest players, the best manager.",
      "\"The easiest decision would be to go to Man United and the biggest club. You always want to be at the biggest clubs but I took the approach that I wanted to be playing first-team football.\"",
      "But Bale bucked the trend; he chose Spurs and spent six seasons carving out a move from left-back to creative forward, scoring 42 goals in 142 appearances and impressing throughout his time in the Premier League.",
      "From there, the Welshman carved out a sensational transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2013 for a then-world record fee of £85million. He joined superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel Di Maria, Karim Benzema, Sergio Ramos, Casemiro and Luka Modric in the famous white kit, and spent nine seasons with the club.",
      "In this time, Bale scored 106 goals in 258 appearances, winning five Champions Leagues, three La Liga titles and a host of other honours. The attacker spent one season back on loan to Spurs, before joining Los Angeles FC and retiring in 2023 as one of the greatest players in both Welsh and footballing history.",
      "So while many would assume Bale would regret the decision to snub Ferguson and his Red Devils – who won the Premier League title under Sir Alex in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013 – for Spurs, the retired winger insisted that a need for consistent game time at a young age was more important to him than money and glory.",
      "He added: \"At that age, a lot of players would go for the money and would want to go to a bigger club.",
      "\"But I was playing, developing and learning. It was an important part of my development to keep playing first-team football because you can't replicate that.\"",
      "Now, it seems that Bale will have the last laugh over the team that could've been but wasn't, as he made a sly joke at United's expense following their damaging European defeat this week.",
      "During TNT Sport's broadcast of Spurs' 1-0 Europa League final win, Bale was questioned on whether this win will get rid of the 'Spursy' tagline that the club are serial losers.",
      "He was quick to respond at United's woes, as he said: \"It could be a United-y thing now, I am telling you. But it gets rid of that stigma now for sure, and hopefully we can build on it.\"",

      "That defeat means United won't be playing European football next season and the scrutiny over Amorim's position has risen.",

      "They have to frame next season positively. Free midweeks for Ruben Amorim to coach the players to within an inch of their lives, ample rest between matches and the motivation to ensure United do not end up anywhere near to where they are now.",

      "Luke Chadwick can still remember the first time. He was a Manchester United youngster on loan at Antwerp in Belgium and finally starting to feel like a professional footballer. He was playing regularly, playing well, and loving his time there.",
      "He was such a part of the club that he was asked to do an interview with a national newspaper. Then just 19, he hadn't done any media training at United and hated speaking to the press, but he did it and stumbled his way through it. He went out and bought a copy of the newspaper to see what kind of rave review he was going to get.",
      "\"I don’t even know why I bought it because I can’t speak Flemish, I can’t read it, but there was a couple of words in there I could get,\" said Chadwick.",
      "In fairness, it didn't take a lot of translating. 'Dentures a la Bugs Bunny,' was one. There were several references to 'acne'. Chadwick's heart sank.",
      "\"I wanted to go and get all the copies so no one else could read it. It was just a really unpleasant, uncomfortable feeling. It was like I was embarrassed for myself, I'm embarrassed that loads of people are going to see what this person has wrote about me and I just felt, I don't know, I struggled to let it go out of my mind, it was always just there, it was something I just kept thinking about.\"",
      "Chadwick first touched on the issues he had felt when his looks became such a part of the public consciousness in a social media post during lockdown in 2020. He talks about it candidly again in his new book, Not Just A Pretty Face, and more than two decades on from when he became an unwitting celebrity for something other than his football, he is unflinchingly honest about how it made him feel.",
      "After his post five years ago, he received apologies from Nick Hancock and Gary Lineker for their part in the mickey-taking on the TV game show 'They Think It’s All Over', but he said it was unnecessary then and is still unnecessary now. He holds no bitterness towards the people involved, and if anything seems more self-critical, that he was unable to understand why it was making him feel the way he did.",
      "\"I felt quite helpless about it because I'd never open up, I'd never talk about it because I didn't have the self-awareness to do it, I didn't have the emotional intelligence to say 'this is bothering me',\" said Chadwick, who never had an issue with how he looked.",
      "“When you don't do that, it just gets worse and worse and it's just a vicious circle. When I got back to England and it got worse, I just thought that that's all I am, I'm just a picture of fun, someone that looks funny to people, that doesn't look how a footballer or anyone should look.",
      "\"The biggest challenge was how I was with myself because I treated myself so unkindly about it, I wouldn't give myself a break, it was like ‘Why are you letting this affect you?\"",
      "Chadwick refused to speak to friends and family about the issue and insisted all was fine, but inside things got so bad that as his career as a United player came to an end in 2004, he could see an upside in disappearing out of the public eye a little.",
      "\"I'd just try and sweep it to the back of my mind, I wouldn't speak to my family about it, I wouldn't speak to my girlfriend about it, I wouldn't speak to my friends if anyone said anything about it,\" he said.",
      "\"I'd just sort of say, 'don't bother me, it's funny', laugh along with it and that sort of thing, where inside it was eating away at me and I think it got to a point when I did leave that it was quite a relief to be out and where not many people are as bothered about you when you're playing in the Championship.\"",
      "Chadwick reflects on that time in the early 2000s as a big part of his journey and something that has helped him understand his own mental health and how important it is to open up.",
      "\"It's a massive part of my life and my self-development, in terms of going through that has allowed me to understand my thoughts and feelings, my mental health a lot better, and to be able to deal with that,\" he said.",
      "\"I just thought I was weak, stop being weak, which was the completely wrong way to think about it, but unfortunately, that's how I was at the time, and I thought I can't be vulnerable, the only people that are are weak people, which is completely wrong.",
      "\"It's still going on that journey of learning about yourself that being vulnerable is the only way we can deal with challenging situations and to talk out and to speak about them.\"",
      "Chadwick met with the MEN at Hotel Football. He was recognised by one young fan who asked for a selfie, but the 44-year-old revealed that when he returns to Manchester and the stadium he graced for a few years, he struggles to piece together that young footballer and the man he is now.",
      "\"When I look back now and walk past Old Trafford, I cannot believe that I used to play in that stadium and the enormity of it now is much bigger than when you're actually in it,\" he said.",
      "\"I definitely didn't appreciate it. I think it's hard as a 19 or 20-year-old kid to really appreciate what you're doing and know that you're in a very privileged situation.",
      "\"I recognise that you've got to be very special to stay at Man United for a long period of time, but it's more football in general, you're doing something you love doing, but it's something where you're never satisfied, you're never really happy.",
      "\"There's always something good that happens, but then it's on to the next one and you never really get that satisfaction. I've done something that I've loved doing. I've played at Old Trafford a few times. It's crazy.\"",
      "Chadwick's book is searingly honest and full of humour and the title reveals he is not afraid of poking a little fun at himself as well. It also reveals a footballer who never lost his love of the game.",
      "He was with Arsenal when United approached him about a trial at the age of 14. Although a Cambridge United fan, he followed Manchester United thanks to the emergence of young players like Ryan Giggs, and when offered the chance of a week-long trial, he jumped at it.",
      "He met Alex Ferguson on the final day and scored in front of the Scot. He felt he had done well and chewed over the week on the train back to his Cambridgeshire village where he was picked up by his mum.",
      "\"When she picked me up, I got in the car and she said that Alex Ferguson had phoned her up and asked if I would sign,\" remembers Chadwick.",
      "\"I thought she was mucking about to start with, but to get that there was only one club I was going to. I was so scared though because I had to tell Arsenal.\"",
      "They didn't want to take no for an answer, so youth team boss Terry Murphy told manager Bruce Rioch, and they turned up at the Chadwick residence to make their case.",
      "\"We sat with Bruce and Terry knowing that I was going to sign for United,\" said Chadwick. \"As soon as United offered me something, I was never going to go [back to Arsenal]. I didn't tell Bruce that, I just said I needed a bit of time to think about it. I think I got my mum to phone up Terry in the end.",
      "\"Arsenal was obviously a brilliant football club, but I didn't really enjoy it that much, going there training on a Wednesday night, going into London, going to Highbury. Some brilliant players, the coaches were great, but I was so shy and introverted back then, I was really uncomfortable, I really disliked playing with people that I wasn’t comfortable with.",
      "\"At United it was just the way that you were made to feel, you just immediately felt even as a 14 year old kid part of something really special and I absolutely loved it and felt so different, I didn't feel as shy or as introverted, I felt really comfortable because of the way that the coaches were and they were so enthusiastic, they were so happy to see us kids that were there as well and I just fell in love with it straight away.\"",
      "Chadwick was scouted and signed as a striker, but he lacked the physical strength to play up front and was turned into a hard-working winger by Eric Harrison.",
      "As he progressed through the ranks, there was a little excitement and expectation in the air around Chadwick, and he admits he got \"big-headed\" at one point. He was then dropped for an FA Youth Cup tie against Blackburn and brought back down to earth.",
      "He did crack the first team. He made 39 appearances and scored two goals, both in the Premier League, one of which was the clear highlight of his time at the club.",
      "\"I think the one that I still dine out on today was scoring at Elland Road. I think that goal was the best three-yard tap-in of all time,\" he said. \"I came on at half-time because I think Nicky Butt got injured in a re-jig in midfield, and Nigel Martyn was one of the best goalies in the Premier League at the time but he had an absolute stinker that day.",
      "\"I remember just tapping it in and running off like a lunatic. I was just euphoric. I remember warming up in the first half constantly, because I think Butty had a problem early on and the dogs abuse I was getting when I was running up and down that touch line.",
      "“It just felt like when I scored, I was just absolutely buzzing that I'd scored at their end as well.\"",
      "Chadwick can also remember the game when he realised he was done at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I think when I realised that my time was coming to an end, I came on off the bench. It was against Olympiakos [in October 2002] and we were winning 2-0. I came on as a double sub with Quinton Fortune with about 20 minutes to go.",
      "\"I'd just come back from being off for a couple of months with problems with my groin and pelvis and I felt like I just couldn't get out of third gear.",
      "\"They came back, made it 2-2, and I was thinking 'that's because I've come on, we were winning 2-0'. I remember Scholesy scored a worldie to make it 3-2 at the end so we ended up winning but I just sort of sat in the dressing room after that game thinking, ‘I'm just not at the level here, I need to get my injury sorted’ and I think I just need to start a different challenge, something where I can feel like I'm offering a lot more than I was at the time.\"",
      "While Chadwick contributed to the United cause on the pitch, in a way, it's the daily training sessions he remembers and the standards set then that made the days in between games even more challenging.",
      "\"Every day was so intense,\" he said. \"I remember the season when I was in and around it and sort of played a few games, didn't start many, which meant if you weren't playing you'd train more or less every day for the Champions League and everything, and at the end of the season I was just absolutely exhausted, like physically and mentally, because it was just so, so intense every day.",
      "\"You've got 25 of the best players in the country, and they're all desperate to win the training games and everything. The amount that helps you as a young player, and the lessons I learned from the club are what allowed me to go and have a career in professional football.",
      "\"It was such a steep learning curve, it's given everything every day, and that's what created the success of the club.\"",
      "Chadwick's career eventually ended at his boyhood club, and he admits he struggled with the end of his playing career.",
      "\"I didn't really know what I was going to do, and mentally I just lost all of my identity,\" he said. \"I'd always been a footballer and I thought ‘that’s the best part of life over now’. It's all going to be rubbish now. I'm just going to get old. What do old footballers do? Become coaches.\"",
      "But he didn't enjoy it. The kid who loved football and maintained that passion throughout his career now found himself moaning at referees and the children he coached. He admits he \"hated the person\" he had become at football.",
      "A business opportunity with former colleagues attracted him to the Football Fun Factory, a project offering fun football to children that he is now passionate about.",
      "\"I was seven or eight and I signed for my first grassroots club called Melbourn Tigers. I remember the coaches were called Colin and Martin and I still remember them to this day, they made it so much fun and they were probably the most important coaches, because if I didn't get them positive early experiences I probably wouldn't have become a professional footballer. I wouldn't still love football.",
      "\"It's so important so the opportunity to do that on a mass scale, so tens and thousands of children are joining the Football Fun Factory programs and falling in love with football really captured my imagination.\"",
      "It is back where the journey began for Chadwick."

      "Defeat to Tottenham in the final in Bilbao not only saw United miss out on winning a European trophy but also a place in next season's Champions League.",
      "That has meant United have missed out on millions in potential prize money and revenue next season as they gear up for a season without European football next term.",
      "That being said, they must make some changes this summer in the transfer market and United are understood to be ready to back Defeat to Tottenham in the window.",

      "With that in mind, we have taken a look at United's three biggest transfer jobs facing them this summer",
      "Cunha is available to leave Wolves this summer and United are preparing to pay the £62.5million release clause to sign him.",
      "United are expecting to seal the signing of the 17-goal forward imminently and Amorim is keen to deploy the 25-year-old in one of this two attacking midfield slots in his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Delap has scored 12 goals for a relegated side this season and is available to sign for £30million. United are one of a number of clubs interested, and he has started to hold talks with interested parties, but they are hopeful they can convince the England under-21 international to lead their line next term.",
      "If United push through those moves that will see them part with £92.5million which represents a significant chunk of their budget.",
      "United will need a midfielder and possible upgrades at right-back and in goal. Former United midfielder Paul Scholes also suggested they need a more experienced forward too, even if they sign Delap.",
      "That is going to be expensive and United may struggle to make their budget stretch to solve all of their transfer priorities.",
      "That is where sales in the summer will be key for United to fund their rebuild.",
      "A number of players could leave Old Trafford but we understand the sales of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho have been prioritised to kickstart their summer clearout.",
      "All three players have tasted success on loan this season with Aston Villa, Real Betis and Chelsea respectively and will be in demand this summer.",
      "United have priced Rashford at £40million, Antony will be available for around £32.5m while Chelsea have an obligation to buy Sancho for a fee as high as £25m.",
      "That would see United bring in £97.5million in transfer sales before they even countenance any more sales. Casemiro could be sold amid interest from the Saudi Pro League, while Rasmus Hojlund could also be sold.",
      "Altay Bayindir is expected to leave, while there is also interest in Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. While their sales would not be popular, they would represent pure profit for United in the eyes of PSR.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to his 3-4-2-1 system since being appointed as manager but it is now clear that a number of United players just aren't suited to it.",
      "He will welcome pre-season for extended time on the training pitch to continue to bed in his ideas and no European football will help Amorim with that, too.",
      "But for him to succeed there clearly needs to be wholesale changes but any club would struggle to withstand too much change in one summer. That is a dilemma Amorim must manage to balance next season as the scrutiny over his role inevitably increases."

      "The sight of Leny Yoro's name among the starters at the San Mames Stadium on Wednesday evening immediately increased the confidence levels of Manchester United's supporters with 75 minutes to go until kick-off.",
      "After the Frenchman had recovered from a foot injury in time to be included in the 26-man squad Ruben Amorim named for the trip to Bilbao, United's supporters crossed their fingers in the hope of seeing him make the starting XI.",
      "Much to their delight, he was deemed fit enough to start the Europa League final and he lined up on the right of the back-three, joining forces with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw in defence.",
      "The Frenchman had suffered a foot injury ten days prior to the final, being forced off in United's 2-0 home defeat to West Ham United, and missed the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge five days later, with Amorim admitting he was in a battle against the clock to be fit in time.",
      "Ultimately, despite winning his fitness battle and becoming United's youngest starter in a European final since Brian Kidd back in 1968, it did not make a difference to the outcome.",
      "Brennan Johnson's first half winner sealed Spurs their first trophy in 17 years and condemned United to a second Europa League final defeat in five seasons. It also ended their aspirations of competing in the Champions League next season.",
      "United's powder-puff performance at the San Mames was symbolic of their season, meaning it has put immense strain on their plans for this summer's transfer window.",
      "Champions League qualification would have banked United a minimum of around £85million, meaning they will be guided through this summer's transfer window by Plan B instead.",
      "Understandably, the mood among United's supporters is at an all-time low. Many are sick to the back teeth of this current squad and would happily see Amorim take a sledgehammer to it this summer.",
      "As welcomed as that would be, it is simply unrealistic. United will not be able to oversee the volume of changes that are necessary in just one window.",
      "Instead, it means any hopes of the squad being completely gutted will be on hold. There will, of course, be departures, but not on the scale that is necessary.",
      "United plan for the number of departures to reach double figures. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are expected to be released and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Others, too, will follow them out the door. In truth, there are very few within the squad that should be safe from axe being wielded.",
      "However, there are three members of Amorim's squad that should be safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit this summer, with Yoro being one of them. The 19-year-old was United's most eye-catching signing last summer, with the Reds beating Real Madrid to his signature.",
      "He had a delayed start to his Old Trafford career after fracturing his metatarsal in pre-season, but he has since shown plenty of flashes of the defender United believe he can become. He is equally comfortable on both the right and the left of the back-three and his ball-playing credentials are impressive for a player still so young.",
      "Amad, who has also not been without injury problems this season, is another United should refuse to entertain any offers for. He has excelled under Amorim and was the only player who looked like making anything happen in Bilbao.",
      "Equally capable as a right wing-back or as a right-sided No.10, the Ivorian has excelled under Amorim's coaching methods. His hunger and desire to beat his man and make something happen inside the final third gets United's supporters out of their seats in anticipation that something will happen.",
      "United have always been blessed with players who are natural entertainers and Amad fits that criteria. The club tied him down to a new contract earlier this year and he will be key to Amorim's long-term plans to try and take United forward.",
      "Despite being 11 years Yoro's senior and eight years older than Amad, Bruno Fernandes is another player United should be ensuring is central to Amorim's thinking. No amount of words will sum up the Portuguese's importance, and this season would have been even worse without him.",
      "Outside of those three, you fear no-one else is safe from potentially being offloaded, and that even includes Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho."

      "The dust is beginning to settle on the disappointing Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and with the final match of the Premier League campaign tomorrow, attention is beginning to turn to the summer. United will be eyeing a major rebuild in the transfer window and which players stay, go or arrive will be interesting to see.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho looks more likely to leave than stay at the present moment following his outspoken comments after the Europa League final. Napoli had a bid rejected for his services in the January transfer window.",
      "Elsewhere, Matheus Cunha is seen as a top target for United and the first deal which is likely to be completed this summer. The Wolverhampton Wanderers man has a £62.5m release clause.",

      "Should Chelsea pass on the deal, Leverkusen are prepared to step in and pursue the England international to strengthen their attacking options.",

      "In the wake of Manchester United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, plenty has been said on the players, manager, board and hierarchy at Old Trafford.",
      "Wednesday night's disappointing evening in Bilbao means United will play the 2025/26 season with no European football, only the second time in the last 35 years. A possible 17th-placed finish in the Premier League means it's been a disaster from start to finish at Old Trafford.",

      "The former Chelsea man explained:",
      "We like Luis [Diaz], we like Rashford, and we like other players. Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.",

      "I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go. I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.",
      "United have been reassured that the deal to sign Cunha will not be cancelled despite missing out on Champions League football next season.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano told GiveMeSport that the deal to sign the Wolves man is still set to go through soon.",
      "United already told Matheus Cunha that they are prepared to trigger the clause, so there will be no issues. And so I think it's going to be the first signing of the summer for United. And it's important to say that the player wanted this move, regardless of Champions League football or not, regardless of what happens in the Europa League final. Cunha wants to play for Manchester United, and my understanding is that he will play for Manchester United.",
      "I fear with him that we will end up selling him for £50m-£60m for PSR reasons, possibly this summer - it has been rumoured hasn't it. I fear he might go somewhere else, he might play in a 4-3-3 and he will end up scoring 25 or 30 goals for somebody. That is how good I think this lad could be. Shoehorn him into this system and I think it might be an issue because I am not sure he can play wing-back. I am not sure he is clever enough to be in that No.10 role, I am struggling to find a position for him in this system."

      "\"I always feel like, for a lot of the dual nationals that I’m talking to, the best way for them to really feel how great it is to be around this team is to be around the team, because the guys are great, the environment is really strong and open.",
      "\"And I know that once they come in and work with the guys and see the mentality of the overall group, they’re always going to enjoy it. We're excited to have him. He's still young and he still plans to be with the Under-21s of Wales as well, but I think it will be really good to spend some time with us in Toronto.\"",
      "March continued: \"He’s a dynamic player, he’s very good around the goal. He’s a striker that can play up on the backline but also is good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.",
      "“I talked to him about how he thinks he would fit into us and how I think he would benefit from the experience of being with us. I spoke with his father and his mother at length, and we talked about the overall opportunity of what it would mean to play for the Canadian national team.",
      "\"I think it’s really important that the family feels the connection to Canada. I’ve always wanted to make sure that what it means to be Canadian and what it means to represent the Canadian national team is in their heart, that it’s something that is true to who they are.",
      "“So I think this will be good for Gabe, to see what the experience is like, and then to see how he fits in. The striker position is competitive with us, but he’s still young, and I think he could have the opportunity to establish himself as a flexible player in the way we play, a little bit like how [Lille and Canada forward] Jonathan David plays.”",
      "Biancheri has taken part in several first-team training sessions at Carrington, but he hasn't been named in a matchday squad, despite building an impressive goalscoring record at United.",
      "Biancheri has been the most prolific scorer in the academy this season - he has more goals than Chido Obi - and he possesses the quality to play in different attacking roles.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have both struggled to score this season. They have just 17 goals between them in all competitions and United will sign a new striker in the summer."

      "Staff in football-facing roles including scouting and medical departments were told on Friday that they would be losing their jobs, with the outcome in jobs connected to first-team affairs deferred until the end of the season.",
      "United sources say the majority of the 200 staff members expected to lose their jobs in the latest round of cuts had already been informed of their at-risk status.",

      "With that game now out of the way and just the final Premier League game of the season to come, staff affected in football-facing areas are being informed of their fate, with some told their job roles are being phased out and that they won't be remaining at the club.",
      "The development is another blow to morale at Carrington, with the news delivered so soon after the 1-0 defeat at Spurs which means United miss out on Champions League football next term, leaving a £100million hole in the budget. United have lost more than £370million over the past five years.",
      "The latest redundancies aren't related to the defeat and had been planned as part of the cutback of 150 to 200 jobs. Those redundancies follow on from 250 staff being made redundant a year ago.",
      "United employed around 1,100 people when Ineos took control of the club's football operations in February 2024, but that workforce is now expected to be slashed to around 650 employees. It is part of a series of cost-cutting measures driven by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who attended the final in Bilbao with fellow co-owner Avram Glazer.",

      "Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna believes striker Liam Delap is \"as good as what there is out there anywhere in the world\" amid Manchester United's interest in his signature.",
      "McKenna revealed on Friday that the 22-year-old has held talks with interested clubs ahead of this summer's transfer window and that it is looking likely that he will leave Portman Road this summer.",
      "Delap, who joined Ipswich from Manchester City last summer, has a £30million release clause in his contract that will be activated this summer following the Tractor Boys' relegation from the Premier League.",
      "In his first full season as a Premier League player, the striker has exceeded expectations by scoring a respectable 12 goals in a team that has won just four league games all season.",
      "United, who are desperate to add some firepower to their attacking options this summer, have been joined in the race to sign Delap by Chelsea and Newcastle United, highlighting the level of interest in his services.",
      "And in the opinion of McKenna, the former City striker has the potential to reach the very top.",
      "\"He's got great potential,\" said McKenna, as quoted by the East Anglian Daily Times. \"It's clear for everyone to see, I think, what he's done this season for a newly promoted team that's found it really difficult.",
      "\"Not just in his goals, but in some of his performances where he's been almost impossible for the opposition to handle. I've said many times, he's still young. He still has room to grow, to be more consistent, to round off his game.",
      "\"But in terms of attributes, I think he's as good as what there is out there anywhere in the world.\"",
      "McKenna's comments will undoubtedly excite United's supporters, who are desperate to see the club draft in a new marksman this summer. Delap, however, remains a raw talent and is yet to establish himself as a consistent goalscorer, which is one of the improvements McKenna hopes he will be able to make.",
      "However, his return this season, his running power and his willingness to shoot from both inside and outside the penalty area make him an attractive proposition for £30m.",
      "Last year, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe discussed the direction in which he wanted to take United's recruitment in after years of reckless spending and paying inflated prices for players, and he admitted he relished the challenge of trying to unearth young talent and develop players who were not yet the finished article.",
      "\"What I would rather do is find the next [Kylian] Mbappe, rather than spend a fortune just trying to buy success,\" Ratcliffe told the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast in March last year. \"It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way?",
      "\"Anybody could figure that one out. But what's much more challenging is to to find the next Mbappe, the next [Jude] Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.\"",
      "Of course, Delap is not exactly an unknown quantity after plundering 12 Premier League goals in his first full season in the top flight, but neither is he the finished article.",
      "He fits the criteria for the type of signing Ratcliffe has suggested United should be going in search of. At a juncture where established strikers cost big-money, £30m on Delap could be a calculated gamble worth taking."

      "If only Victor Thorp had cut his toenails that April Sunday morning. If Thorp was onside in the 120th minute at Wembley, he would have consigned Manchester United to one of their most ignominious defeats to second-tier Coventry City. It would have been sacked in the evening, rather than the morning for Erik ten Hag.",
      "United's season would have ended trophyless. Instead, it ended gloriously, and the game is about glory. No United fan at Wembley in May last year will forget their day in the sun.",
      "But the club's 13th FA Cup triumph was detrimental in the long run. Sir Jim Ratcliffe lost his nerve, kept Ten Hag and United have lost 18 Premier League games already this season. They are assured of a schedule devoid of jaunts across the continent next season.",
      "United's wallets will be hit. There will be a derisory merit payment for what could be a 17th-place finish in the Premier League, no European revenue, no matchday revenue in the Champions League and a penalty clause invoked in the Adidas deal. Roughly, that is an £80million black hole.",
      "They have squandered nearly £15m keeping Erik ten Hag and then hiring and firing Dan Ashworth. There is also the £200m they largely misspent on players in Ten Hag's last transfer window.",
      "2019 was the year of the 'cultural reset' at United. Reset, revamp or reboot, none of those words do United's current position justice. Without relegation (never a tangible threat), they are at rock bottom.",
      "They have to frame next season positively. Free midweeks for Ruben Amorim to coach the players to within an inch of their lives, ample rest between matches and the motivation to ensure United do not end up anywhere near to where they are now.",
      "Here is a five-point plan to make United a force again:",
      "More proactivism, less pragmatism",
      "Amorim has agonised over whether to play pragmatically or proactively. In Bilbao, he did neither. Alejandro Garnacho was benched as Mason Mount retained the faith of a coach who \"loves\" him yet overlooked the fact that the playmaker is not as much of a goal threat as Garnacho. And United did not score for the 16th time.",
      "One of the accusations levelled at Mount is he does little with the ball. Amorim bristled at the suggestion he had got it wrong by starting Mount, reminding this correspondent that Garnacho missed a one-on-one in the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao, a match Mount emerged in to end the Spanish side's chances of a comeback.",
      "Mount's fleeting purple patch consisted of three goals in two games and he did not play 90 minutes in either. Garnacho had started 14 successive games until his 'rest' for the defeat against West Ham. That he remained on the bench at Chelsea five days later was significant.",
      "Had Leny Yoro not recovered from a foot injury, Amorim would have started the same side that lost at Chelsea. United were competitive for around an hour at Stamford Bridge when matches last for 90 minutes. They managed one attempt on target. Garnacho forced Guglielmo Vicario to dive down to his left within minutes of his belated arrival on Wednesday night.",
      "United also had glaring issues in midfield against Spurs: full backs as wingers. Noussair Mazraoui admitted last week he is more settled as a right centre back as it is the closest position to playing at right back. Mazraoui is not an attack-minded winger and United offered no threat down Tottenham's left-hand side when they ought to have doubled up on the shaky Destiny Udogie.",
      "Bruno Fernandes seemed to have been reinvented as a central midfielder before the March internationals. Then he moved forward again when United's season resumed at Nottingham Forest. Suddenly, he was back in midfield for the dress rehearsal at Chelsea. Amorim maybe wanted some finesse in midfield against the conservative trio of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr but Fernandes, United's top scorer, had to be in the front three for the final.",
      "Mazraoui should be considered a centre half from next season and United need an upgrade on the right wing. Amorim played wingers in the 3-4-2-1 system at Sporting yet has settled on full backs at United. The ends have not justified the means yet United have already invested £25million in the Danish left back Patrick Dorgu, who started by default in Bilbao.",
      "Compromise with youngsters",
      "Garnacho is becoming a problem for United. Like Marcus Rashford before him, he has developed an inflated air of entitlement and it should startle United that a 20-year-old brazenly sounded off about a \"s**t\" season, criticised the manager's decision to drop him and cast doubt on his future. His gobby brother had also joined in online.",
      "The authority of the United manager's role should always be protected but Garnacho is a nuanced case. There has been a willingness from the player and coach to make it work since he was dropped from the Manchester derby squad on December 15 and Amorim has enthused about the adjustments Garnacho has made to his game.",
      "Garnacho remains one of a handful of fan favourites. He was serenaded when he warmed up at San Mames and there was a bullish roar when he was ordered back to come on. He was seen as such an ally of Amorim's he flanked him for the pre-match press conference for the semi-final second leg against Athletic.",
      "United are renowned for wingers and Garnacho is one of the academy's biggest success stories this century. Only Garnacho jars with Amorim's system and a new number 10, Matheus Cunha, is expected to occupy one of those two roles behind the striker.",
      "There has been interest in Garnacho and there is an obvious temptation for United to cash in. He would represent pure profit, you can't tolerate any player publicly questioning the manager and he does not naturally fit into the system.",
      "Napoli, on the verge of a fourth Scudetto, wanted Garnacho in January and deemed him worthy of replacing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Antonio Conte, the Napoli coach, oversaw one of Eden Hazard's greatest seasons at Chelsea. Those are ringing endorsements United should be wary of.",
      "All parties need to sit around a table, thrash out their differences and seek a compromise. That also applies to Kobbie Mainoo, the poster boy of United's future as recently as the start of this season but no longer a regular. Amorim has misgivings about Mainoo as a midfielder and has trialled him as a playmaker and a striker with mixed results.",
      "It would be beyond bold for United to cash in on Mainoo and/or Garnacho when it is not a stretch to imagine them requiring a new manager in the autumn. United can improve with Amorim, Garnacho and Mainoo all on the bus, despite Garnacho's brother claiming he was thrown under it.",
      "Recruit for the club, not the manager",
      "If United fans were given the choice between Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres the majority would opt for the latter. Gyokeres is older and more proven, albeit in a much weaker league, and United know all-too-well the pitfalls of stockpiling players schooled outside one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Gyokeres would be a legitimate exception, yet United have settled on Delap. The dynamic suddenly shifts as the scrutiny would be on Jason Wilcox, rather than Amorim. Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed Wilcox possesses \"the best eyes in football\" and he has not looked far for United's next starting striker, having watched Delap develop at City when he was the head of their academy.",
      "United's recruitment will be severely impacted by the absence of European football from their schedule next season. Cunha and Delap are attainable through release clauses. That feels like a cop-out with Delap, only four days younger than the dismal Rasmus Hojlund. They have a -12 goal difference. They cannot cut corners with the striker's role.",
      "Last year, United operated by a one for the manager, one for the board policy. Ten Hag reunited with Ajax alumni but also integrated two signings from the French league with no links to Dutch football. Leny Yoro should have ushered in a very different recruitment era at United, only their next arrival was the Dutchman Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The mid-season signings of Dorgu and Ayden Heaven have offered a glimpse of what could come this summer and beyond. But the worst United side in 51 years needs proven commodities, particularly if Bruno Fernandes heads for the Riyadh retirement home.",
      "Expendable culture",
      "United are bound to be saddled with some immovable players. Luke Shaw was raw in the San Mames mixed zone, questioning if he is good enough. We all know the answer and he should, too. He is not going to put his own contract through the shredder two years before its expiry date.",
      "Nobody should be off-limits if United receive an acceptable offer. How could they be after a season like this one? That applies to Garnacho and Mainoo. If they want a change of scenery then that is the clincher.",
      "Jose Mourinho was standing in the doorway when he spoke to some of us in San Jose in 2018 and said he would not stand in the way of Anthony Martial, who wanted to leave. But Ed Woodward did. Ratcliffe was still cursing Woodward's methods as recently as March. United have let innumerable players outstay their welcome and Martial was one of them. Shaw is another. Victor Lindelof, too.",
      "The profitability and sustainability rules have influenced the length of contracts but United have got to stop doling out five-year deals like a volunteer with leaflets on Deansgate. Shorter contracts would keep players on their toes. Amorim's deal only has two years left to run and he will be judged much sooner than 2027.",
      "A new fall-guy at hierarchical level",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford sunk his claws into Ratcliffe a while ago and Ratcliffe is quite taken by him. Two years after the Ineos delegation visited Old Trafford, nobody has given a satisfactory explanation for Brailsford's presence on the United football board.",
      "Brailsford has admitted he is \"no expert in football\". You can see that from United's results since he started to have input on their performance. Brailsford was an ally of Ashworth's. United spent longer courting Ashworth than the five months he lasted at United.",
      "Ratcliffe should send Brailsford on his bike. That would show Ineos are serious about arresting United's staggering decline."

      "Barthez's initial impact at Old Trafford was impressive, clinching a Premier League title in his first season and quickly endearing himself to supporters with his flamboyant and daring approach. Yet, despite his early success, his time at the top was marred by inconsistency.",

However, such a decorated career has come at a cost, leaving him with lasting injuries and ailments, reports the Mirror.",
      "Now, the Frenchman has shed light on the profound physical toll professional players endure, revealing that often he played through injuries against his better judgement.",

Attention will then swiftly turn to next season and how the club intends to recover from a disappointing campaign, having amassed just 39 points from their 37 league matches so far."

      "Maguire missed out on a place in Tuchel's first squad selection in March because of an injury, but his latest omission is as a result of first-time inclusion Trevoh Chalobah being ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "The Chelsea defender has played a key role in the Londoners' fight for Champions League qualification this season and Tuchel has cited his performance levels as currently being ahead of those produced by Maguire.",
      "However, the German has insisted that Maguire is \"always in my thoughts\", admitting that he has his uses as both an emergency striker and as a centre-back.",

      "\"At the moment, Ezri [Konsa] keeps his place. Dan Burn, a left-footer, keeps his place. Marc (Guehi) is happier to play on the left side, but had injuries, so we decided on a left-footer in Levi Colwill to get this.",

      "Following Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Wednesday night's Europa League final, Bruno Fernandes revealed he will leave Old Trafford if the club decides to sell him this summer.",
      "Brennan Johnson's first half winner at the San Mames Stadium was enough to clinch Spurs their first trophy since 2008, meaning United, as a result, will go without European football for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign next season.",
      "After a wretched Premier League campaign, both Spurs and United were desperate to seal a backdoor route into next season's Champions League to compete with Europe's elite and boost their respective finances.",
      "United desperately needed Champions League qualification to increase head coach Ruben Amorim's transfer budget to make the rebuild he plans to oversee this summer that little bit easier.",
      "Instead, United are likely to find the transfer market harder to navigate, with their revenue streams impacted as a result of failing to qualify for Europe's premier club competition. It means they will have to be shrew with their recruitment, both in terms of incomings and outgoings.",
      "United are planning for the number of departures to reach double figures this summer, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, each of whom are currently out on loan, being identified as priority sales. The likes of Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are poised to be released when their contracts expire.",
      "However, United, to boost their transfer kitty, could be forced into making some ruthless decisions. Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, who both started the Europa League final on the bench, could be sold.",
      "But despite Fernandes' declaration that he will go if United need to sell him, chief executive Omar Berrada's comments about United's recruitment plans earlier this year suggest that will not be the case, unless, of course, an offer comes along that is too good to turn down.",
      "\"So just because we'll have more revenues to invest if we're in the Champions League, it doesn't mean we're going to go and over-invest,\" he said, speaking at the unveiling of United's new stadium plans in March. \"We need to be cautious and, and we need to try to make as many good decisions as we can in recruitment.",
      "\"And also when it comes to sales, we will do it purely on the basis of whether it helps improve the team or not, not for financial reasons.\"",
      "Berrada's point on sales ought to see United put a hands-off notice on Fernandes. He has been their best player yet again this season, scoring 19 goals, and deciding to sell him would instantly weaken Amorim's starting XI and squad.",
      "The United captain, who is reportedly of interest to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, has been a beacon of light in a dark and miserable season for the Reds. His goals in the Premier League have directly earned United five points and he finished the Europa League campaign as the competition's joint-top leading goalscorer with seven.",
      "Of course, if a mega-money offer is submitted that United simply cannot afford to turn down, then they must consider it for a player who will turn 31 later this year. But unless that happens, his importance to the team is more valuable than a financial offer that is unlikely to be enough to replace Fernandes with a player of equal quality.",
      "Both Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Amorim have already waxed lyrical about Fernandes, outlining his importance and brilliance, meaning an exit is highly unlikely.",
      "And with Berrada already stating that decisions on outgoing players will rest on their importance to the team and not financial reasons, United should not be planning to let their captain go."

      "Now, it is only the Champions League winner who is guaranteed a place in Pot A next season. The rest are assigned a position based on their UEFA coefficient ranking.",
      "As each team must play two clubs from each pot, the advantage of being in Pot A is greatly reduced. However, that will not avoid the embarrassment for Spurs when they are likely placed in a lower pot due to their poor performance in the Premier League this season.",
      "The exact pots for each team will be decided once the qualifying rounds have been completed. Ultimately, this is a meagre boost for United who would much rather be in the Champions League than out of it.",
      "But, the hope from the United camp will be that without the distraction of European football, they can return to at least the Europa League for the 2026/27 season."

      "In the medium to long term, in losing out to Spurs in the showpiece final at Athletic Bilbao’s Estadio de San Mames, United now have no European football whatsoever to look forward to next season, with the high-stakes nature of the game this week seeing the winners book UEFA Champions League qualification for next season, and with it a revenue boost, even at a conservative estimate and without factoring in progression to the knockout stages, of some £70m.",
      "Add in a further £17m or so for the additional matchday revenue that they will miss out on and it becomes even more of a bitter pill to swallow for the club.",
      "As a publicly listed business on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), it’s far easier to take a temperature check as to how the markets feel about the club's performance on the pitch, which is closely linked to how well they do off it.",
      "When the bell sounded the day after the club’s defeat, and with it a lack of Champions League football, shares on the NYSE slumped by 7.8%.",
      "Shares in the club were trading at $13.40 on Thursday when the markets opened, a sum that was even below the $14 per share that existed at the time of the company’s initial public offering back in 2012. As of Friday morning they were trading at $13.29 per share.",
      "To look at the share slump against the value per share that Manchester United co-owner and the club’s second largest shareholder, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, paid when he took a 27.7% stake in the team back in December of 2023, he paid $33 per share for the stake held by his company, INEOS, a deal that had seen the club valued at $5.4bn (£4bn).",
      "That valuation of the club has been continuously challenged through heavy losses creating financial constraints, the redundancies affecting some 250 staff over the past 12 months, and a dismal performance on the pitch that has now seen them without a lucrative European football revenue stream for next season, something that can impact the club’s commercial performance and ability to attract better players to improve their situation.",
      "A recent report from US sports business website Sportico pegged Manchester United’s 2025 valuation at $6.1bn (£4.52bn). While that represented a rise in valuation compared to what Ratcliffe paid, it was down 2% compared to the 2024 list.",
      "The $13.4 per share that was being traded on Thursday implied a market capitalisation of $2.3bn of the football club, although only the A shares, which carry inferior voting rights privileges, trade on the NYSE.",
      "There was optimism from investors ahead of the Ratcliffe deal in late 2023, with shares trading at around $20.38 late in December. But since then there has been a major slump and the share price has shown little sign of rising by any significant percentage in the last 18 months."

      "Joan Garcia (£12.5m)\nAndre Onana’s displays, a la Hojlund, have fallen off a cliff following a promising debut campaign at Old Trafford as David De Gea’s long-term replacement has become a real liability between the sticks.",
      "The signing of a new goalkeeper has shot up Man Utd’s list of priorities as the season has developed, to the point where it is a must this summer.",
      "Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez seems the most likely to join, but spending £40m on a 32-year-old who has massively declined this season would not be wise. Instead, Man Utd would be better off signing an up-and-coming goalkeeper, with Espanyol standout Joan Garcia an obvious candidate.",
      "If reports are to be believed, Garcia is expected to join Arsenal to compete with David Raya next season, but he would be fighting a losing battle at the Emirates and would get much more game time at Man Utd.",
      "Garcia has sparkled in a poor Espanyol team, with his £25m release clause to fall to only £12.5m if they are relegated on the final day of the La Liga season. With his side two points clear of safety amid a five-game losing streak, that is entirely plausible.",
      "",
      "Daniel Munoz (£21m)\nFinishing with the least feasible but perhaps best potential signing, Munoz has been a joy to watch in an extremely likeable Crystal Palace side, with his supreme FA Cup final performance key to his side’s triumph over Manchester City.",
      "Munoz only cost around £6.7m as Crystal Palace pulled off another transfer masterstroke to pluck him from relative obscurity in the Belgian Pro League for the bright lights of the Premier League.",
      "The wing-back’s value (according to transfermarkt) has increased to £21m, but a bid in this region would surely come up short this summer, with Palace wise to demand at least double for the 28-year-old if/when there is interest.",
      "Barring January signing Patrick Dorgu, Man Utd’s current wing-back options are certainly in the full-back category, and they need a new right-sider to make Amorim’s team more balanced and effective. Were Munoz to become a gettable target, they would be daft not to roll out the red carpet for the Palace standout.",
      "Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna has confirmed that Manchester United and Chelsea-linked striker Liam Delap is “looking at his options for next year”.",

      "Man Utd and Chelsea could face fresh competition for the signature of Liam Delap from a fellow Premier League club, according to reports.",

      "Ruben Amorim looks set to be Manchester United manager for the start of next season despite offering to fall on his sword and he’s a lucky/unlucky boy. His would have been a sure-fire sacking 99 times out of 100 based on the evidence of what he’s done in six months at Old Trafford.",
      "Here are ten reasons he should obviously be given the boot.",
      "",
      "Statistically the worst\nWe have to go back to 1927 and Herbert Hamlett to find a Manchester United manager with a worse win percentage than Amorim’s 36.59%. It’s the fourth worst in the club’s history. His Premier League win record of 24% is comfortably the worst of any United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign, with David Moyes’ 50% the second-worst.",
      "The 0.92 points-per-game Amorim has won this season after Erik ten Hag and Ruud van Nistelrooy got them to 15 from the first 11 games between them would have seen United claim just shy of 35 points across a 38-game season, which would have seen them relegated in 11 Premier League campaigns this century and is the worst record after 26 games of any manager of the traditional ‘big six’ clubs.",
      "",
      "Subjectively ‘the worst’\n“We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United.” Straight from the horse’s mouth. And while Amorim’s mastery of self-deprecation over the last few months is something to be admired – at least he knows they’re sh*t – that shouldn’t obscure our view or cause us to lose sight of the fact that they are really, really sh*t.",
      "There were widespread complaints across the fanbase over the football played under pretty much every manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, but there was always something to hang your hat on: Fight under Jose Mourinho; rigidity under Louis van Gaal; chaos under Ole Gunner Solskjaer. It was never good enough, but it was sometimes good, sometimes fine and sometimes bad. This is almost all bad.",
      "",
      "What is his philosophy?\nCan you tell us what Amorim’s philosophy is without referring to what he did at Sporting? After six months – six months – we don’t even know what Manchester United’s style is supposed to be. It’s 3-4-3, we sure as sh*t know that. But are Manchester United a possession-based team? What kind of pressing does he want? How high is their defensive line meant to be? Should the wide centre-backs be stepping into midfield? What’s the job of the inverted wingers?",
      "We don’t know and the players appear to have even less of an idea. Also, any chance of a novel set-piece? Y’know, some evidence of coaching. Cheers.",
      "",
      "Refusal to change\nWe wonder if Amorim has had even the slightest wobble over his dedication to stay true to what worked at Sporting through half a year of that not working in any way, shape or form at Old Trafford.",
      "The blame for this obsession with footballing principles is often aimed at Pep Guardiola, but the Manchester City side that won the Treble is a far cry from his Barcelona side and even his early winning teams at the Etihad. Mikel Arteta has tweaked and adapted in five seasons at Arsenal. And Arne Slot has proven the value in making not insignificant changes to Liverpool’s style and system, not just across the season but during games to walk to the Premier League title.",
      "Surely a manager who can play in multiple different ways, albeit with a few non-negotiables, is just unequivocally better than a manager who can’t. Even the most principled manager perhaps in the history of the Premier League ripped up his own rule book to get the better of Amorim and beat United to the Europa League title.",
      "",
      "Failure to coach players to fit the system\nWe understand the excuse of these United players not being good enough. They’re a damn sight better than 16th in the Premier League, but for a team that’s historically won and challenged for major titles, it’s a fair point. We also understand that many of them, seemingly most of them, do not suit Amorim’s system. They’ve got full-backs who aren’t wing-backs, wingers instead of inverted wingers, etc etc.",
      "What we neither understand nor accept is that the majority of them can’t be coached to suit the system. They may not be their ideal positions, but surely they can be coached to improve in roles that exist in Amorim’s XI rather than being cast out before thriving away from Manchester United, as Antony and Marcus Rashford have done this season.",
      "We’re surprised Roy Keane hasn’t told Amorim ‘it’s his job’ yet.",
      "",
      "Money required to buy players to fit the system\nPut yourself in Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s shoes for a moment (horrible, right?) and imagine what it must be like to be told by your manager, whom you’ve hired through no little expense, that 90 per cent of the players you pay the wages of aren’t suited to his system and so aren’t in his plans moving forward.",
      "What in your mind would be the path of least resistance? Sign five or six players this summer and another five or six next summer for £400m or whatever that would cost, or sack the manager and get someone in who could put these players to better use?",
      "Amorim has admitted that he’s asking for “faith” he’s neither earned nor deserves and having spent £200m on Erik ten Hag’s players last summer after their worst-ever Premier League season before sacking him a couple of months later – which Ratcliffe himself acknowledges was a mistake – it would be the definition of insanity to do exactly the same thing again.",
      "",
      "He’s a loser\nOk, it’s not exactly the same thing because Ten Hag won a trophy at the end of his miserable campaign while Amorim lost the Europa League final at the end of his even more miserable campaign.",
      "We thoroughly enjoyed the Class of ’92 pundits insisting Manchester United would win on Wednesday having lost three times already to Tottenham this season through ‘logic’ amounting to nothing more than their typical This Is Manchester United b*llocks.",
      "Presumably they and the rest of us can now finally accept that This Is Not Manchester United after they lost an actual final to actual Spurs and make judgements on a team’s chances of winning something based on how good they are at football rather than through rubbing crystal skulls and tracking the position of the moon in the week leading up to it.",
      "And for that, Mr Amorim, we thank you.",
      "",
      "Available managers\nWe’re not about to suggest that anyone could replace Amorim and mount anything close to a title challenge, but there will definitely be a few we would back to make a decent fist of what currently looks like the club’s impossible target Ratcliffe has set of sixth in the Premier League next season.",
      "We would love to see Simone Inzaghi at Old Trafford and believe his and Inter’s policy of signing experienced players with something to prove would be an excellent method of righting the United ship. But that’s not going to happen, because a) why would he leave Inter for United? and b) United aren’t about to pay the compensation.",
      "There are several very capable available managers though: Xavi, Marco Rose, Max Allegri, Edin Terzic. The question will be whether they could attract any of them like a moth to the flames of their dumpster fire. They could always reignite their interest in Gary O’Neil.",
      "",
      "‘Untouchables’ to get-the-f***-out-of-our-club-ables\nYou might have seen the scarves – the ones with the faces of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo on them along with some sort of tagline hailing them as the future of Manchester United. They were The Untouchables ahead of the 2024 summer transfer window – the only players they would not listen to offers for.",
      "The fact that Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot have had the same moniker bestowed upon them at points in the meantime shows just how insecure that sacrosanct status can be, but we never would have guessed a year ago that by the start of the 2025-26 season not one of Hojlund, Garnacho or Mainoo would still be at the club and that’s a very real possibility.",
      "And it’s not because of PSR. Garnacho and Mainoo would both be ‘pure profit’ sales, but they would have been last summer too, and there’s absolutely no chance United would let them go if Amorim wanted to keep them given the extraordinary lack of players in his squad he has any faith in whatsoever.",
      "They’ve both got flaws, sure, but United used to be a place where flawed players became infallible, where immaturity would make way for professionalism and dominance. If United’s goal is to sign players whose value can increase through their time at the club then they’ve got to have a manager willing and able to nurture them through that process.",
      "",
      "No compensation\nHe’s f***ing asking for it, mate. No “conversation about compensation”? That’s a red or white flag depending how you look at it. Put him out of his misery and bring the next poor b*stard in.",
      "Neville has urged Amorim to “wipe out” one Man Utd and to “stop doing the honourable thing” after defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "It will be far cheaper to sack Ruben Amorim than keep him at Manchester United and Arne Slot has ‘chucked one of his own under the bus’.",
      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",

      "Performances and results under Amorim have been worse than they were under Ten Hag as Man Utd are at risk of finishing 17th in the Premier League. They have also come up short in the Europa League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup, so they won’t play in Europe next season.",
      "It would be harsh to sack Amorim before he’s had the opportunity to build a more-suited squad, but former Man Utd assistant Rene Meulensteen reckons he’ll be gone after ten games next season on one condition.",
      "“He has to win eight out of 10 or 90% of the games at the start of the season, that’s how long ten Hag was given (sacked after nine league and one EFL cup games on October 28th),” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",

      "Meulensteen has also argued that the “writing is on the wall” for Amorim, who has made one huge “mistake”.",
      "“The writing has been on the wall for quite some time. You could see there was a negative line in terms of performances and results under ten Hag. Eventually, when that line was persistently going down, they got rid of ten Hag to bring Amorim in,” Muelensteen added.",
      "“If you look through all the stats, all the numbers, and all the performances, that line continues to decline. Apart from in the Europa League, which was a different competition, and even then, it required luck in the miracle game against Lyon.

      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho is reportedly ‘increasingly likely’ to leave the Premier League giants as he’s ‘unhappy’ with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Garnacho is one of Man Utd‘s best young footballers, but he’s rightly been criticised for his poor form and attitude this season.",
      "The Argentina international has been erratic in front of the goal as he often makes the wrong decision with his final pass/shot and he’s also butted heads with Amorim.",
      "United’s head coach dropped Garnacho and Marcus Rashford for December’s Manchester derby. His response to this snub was better than the Englishman’s, but he has also struggled to fully reintegrate himself.",
      "It was widely reported in January that the Red Devils could offload Garnacho and/or Kobbie Mainoo as they look to raise funds for a huge squad overhaul and the two academy graduates may leave this summer.",
      "READ: Manchester United need to stick with Amorim, ‘shut up, take our medicine and be patient’",
      "Garnacho is arguably more replaceable than Mainoo because he is not suited to the No.10 or wing-back role in Amorim’s 3-4-3 system.",
      "The 20-year-old’s best performances this season have come in the Europa League, but he started Wednesday’s final on the bench and only came on for the last 20 minutes against Spurs.",
      "This did not sit well with Garnacho, with his brother accusing Amorim of “throwing him under the bus”.",
      "Garnacho said: “It’s tough for everyone. This season has been sh*t. Losing the final now and not beating anyone in the league.",
      "“There were a lot of things missing – when you don’t score goals, you always need more at the end. I played every round until we reached the final, I helped the team, and to play twenty minutes today… I don’t know.”",
      "Now, a report from ESPN claims Garnacho is ‘increasingly likely’ to leave Man Utd this summer and there is expected to be a ‘meeting’ between the club and his representatives ‘in the coming days’.",
      "Garnacho said to be ‘upset and unhappy’ at how the head coach has handled ‘the situation around his selection for the game’ and ‘at being limited to just 20 minutes’.",
      "Regarding Man Utd’s stance on offloading the winger, the report adds:",
      "‘United are open to facilitating a move for Garnacho in the summer transfer window. He was the subject of a bid from Napoli in January and there is also interest from Chelsea.",
      "‘Sources have told ESPN that Garnacho’s representatives are also expecting interest from other Premier League clubs and from Saudi Arabia.’",
      "Neville has urged Amorim to “wipe out” one Man Utd and to “stop doing the honourable thing” after defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "It will be far cheaper to sack Ruben Amorim than keep him at Manchester United and Arne Slot has ‘chucked one of his own under the bus’.",
      "A Man Utd manager would be sacked 99 times out of 100 based on what Amorim’s done this season. Here’s ten reasons why Ratcliffe should give him the boot.",
      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been accused of committing a “sackable offence” in his side’s Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur."

      "Spurs and the Europa\nI am a 50 year old, Australian born, lifelong Spurs supporter. When I say lifelong, I mean it. I’m named for Martin Chivers, Steve Perryman and Pat Jennings. My dad was a season ticket holder before my parents moved here in the 70s. One of my most prized possessions is a congratulatory card to my parents after my birth, signed by the first team at the time.",
      "I remember being woken at midnight to watch the 81 and 82 FA Cup finals and talking to my dad after the 1991 final, his last.",
      "When I finally moved to England for a few years in 2001, the first thing I did was get a ticket to White Hart Lane (3-0 vs Coventry). I was at the Lane to see us beaten 3-0 by Chelsea, took my now wife to see the godawful loss to Sam Allardyce’s Bolton just after Bill Nick died. I was even there for the league cup collapse to 10 man Manchester City.",
      "This is all why Wednesday night/Thursday morning meant so much, even from so far away. It’s the first trophy of my 15 year old son’s life (by his age, we had 3, including the 84 UEFA cup) and watching it with him made me think about my own father and how much he’d have loved to see it.",
      "Luckily for my son, as I grew up on the Central Coast I made the Mariners my A-League team and he’s seen 3 grand final wins (including last year when we made it there) and another grand final win for the women’s team last Sunday (yes – some of us do watch women’s football).",
      "The Europa league final was awful. The league form, even before putting all of the eggs in the EL basket, inexcusable.",
      "I don’t care. I don’t much like Ange, but he’s right. This was for the true believers. I’m raising a glass and toasting this team and all of the Spurs supporters who share the joy with me.",

      "Wow.. what a few days.",
      "As a Spurs fan, even at the best of times, you know you’re gonna get punched in the mouth every now and again. This season, it felt like being a few rounds deep with Muhammad Ali most weeks.",
      "Despite it all, for Ange Postecoglou and that group of players to persist and persevere, and push through all the negativity, the crises of confidence, the injuries, the noise, and to come out the other side holding their first trophy in nearly 20 years is inspiring.",
      "I only got to catch up on F365 mailboxes today, so I got a nice little chuckle at all the panicked rationalizing from other fans: It’s only the Europa League, two terrible teams, worst final ever, Don’t deserve Champions League, tallest dwarf, etc. Seeing opposition fans horrified that they can no longer ‘banter’ Spurs over being trophyless, and scrambling to find new sticks to beat Spurs it is delightful. You keep doing whatever you need to do guys, we’ll just keep watching the clips of Sonny lifting the cup on repeat. (Although credit to David Tickner, who I’ve criticised for his anti-Spurs takes before, for his magnanimous article celebrating Spurs and Ange!)",
      "But really I wanted to write in about Ange – and to say to Ange I’m sorry I ever doubted.",
      "I was a huge Ange advocate since the beginning. He wasn’t a mercenary like Jose or Conte, temporarily gracing lowly Spurs with his presence. He was a man with passion and a vision. He was going to make Spurs winners again. He was going to rebuild the culture at the club. He was going to make fans and players believe. And he was going to do it playing exciting, attacking football.",
      "The attacking, exciting football part has been a bit of a problem. It’s glorious when it’s good, but when it’s been bad, it’s been awful. Dizzyingly high defensive lines, gaps in positions, and a dreadful injury crisis meant we were cannon fodder for teams who could sit back and wait to counterattack on us. 20+ league defeats later, and even I, a big Ange-truther, was beginning to say this project had run its course.",
      "He was ridiculed in the press. He’s been hounded out of his job in every interview. F365 among others have kept a regularly refreshed list of his potential successors live on the site since October. When we were dumped out of the league cup and FA cup, journalists were quick to smugly ask him if he was still going to win something in his second season.",
      "And he did.",
      "For him to take all that flack for himself, to bear all the brunt of the criticism, so that the players could focus on the job to be done is incredible. He’s led them to success for the first time in 20 years. Something Conte, Pochettino, Mourinho, Redknapp never did. He always wins things in his second season, mate.",
      "But what now? I’m conflicted.",
      "The league form was truly awful, and while it might be absolved, given the Europa success, it could never be acceptable again. My head says maybe the best thing is for Ange to leave now as a hero, who brought this team back to the winners circle, and calls it a promise kept. Spurs move on, and bring in a Thomas Frank or someone to hopefully build on this momentum, but take us in a slightly new, more pragmatic direction. Fresh start.",
      "But I think the heart says different. Ange says his work is not yet done. And the players seem to agree. Despite everything, the likes of Van de Ven, Maddison, Kulusevski, Bissouma, Vicario and others have come to bat for Ange – “We want to win this for him”. For him to keep the belief of a dressing room after a season like that is incredible. After an achievement like Wednesday, that bond will be even stronger. If I thought Ange could adapt his style, and adopt elements of the pragmatic style that won him his last few European fixtures, and if the chairman could support him in the transfer market, then I think the option that would make me happiest is to see us press ahead with Big Ange!",
      "Either way, huge congrats to Ange – Spurs fans will never forget the success he’s brought. I’ll always be wishing for his success, in our dugout, or another.\nAndy, Spurs, Eire",
      "",
      "Ange stays and Ruben goes\nThanks to a flight delay, I got to watch the first 30 minutes of the Europa League final, but had to shut down before the goal. I wasn’t terribly disappointed to turn it off, because it was awful. When I landed, I learned the result and saw the goal credited to Brennan Johnson, but my son had commented in the EPL Discord group we share with my friends and their friends that it was a Shaw OG. That’s just funnier, and I would prefer to believe it.",
      "With many apologies to Tottenham supporters — you’ve my sincere congratulations on your Europa League win, and I’m quite jelly, because it beats our pot sideways — I generally appreciate F365’s evident editorial pleasure in regarding Spurs as Spursy and openly endorsing in advance the funniest possible Europa League Final narrative vis-à-vis Spurs. I hope you’ll understand: it’s an objectively funny narrative precisely because it’s silly.",
      "So, Spurs haven’t won a trophy in 17 years? Cry me a river. That’s far more success than Newcastle United or Crystal Palace could boast in 2024, so it’s hard to feel very bad about having that particular laugh. Especially when it’s more or less true; Spurs’ league form has been shocking.",
      "But I agree with Tickner and several Mailbox contributors that the cup win changes things for Ange Postecoglou. Unless you want to consider the possibility that he’s the Kwisatz Haderach, you have to treat his prophecy as merely a demonstrable trend. This is the fifth consecutive job in which he’s won a trophy in his second season, and trophies aren’t available every year for an international coach. I’ve little doubt he left the Australia job precisely because he knew he couldn’t win them a World Cup, asked himself what succeeding would look like, and didn’t like the answer.",
      "Big Ange may just be what he appears to be at this moment: a remarkably adaptable coach for whom short-term success is very likely, but is only now beginning his first attempt at sustained success at the highest level. I’m not aware of how much input he has in transfers, but I’d call most of the bigger outlays attributed to him moderately successful; extremely successful, if the goal Levy set was a trophy in year two.",
      "Spurs supporters may have a different perspective, but I have a lifetime of experience with volatile team owners in the US, and it’s hard for me to imagine Daniel Levy firing Ange right now. It would alienate many (though I suspect not all) supporters, and trophies are what an owner looks for in a coach or manager. Prize money, and the guarantee of more prize money next year.",
      "And if Levy does push the eject button, Ange will likely have a wealth of opportunities and a very happy agent. He’s in the catbird seat right now, as we inexplicably say in the Southeastern US.",
      "Also: given our cup history over my lifetime, I can almost never find it in myself to be disappointed with a Manchester United loss. The stats seem to suggest they should have won, and Amorim is accused of mismanagement in 16 Conclusions. Indeed, one wonders if a Jim Ratcliffe-influenced board might just snatch at his offer to decline compensation if sacked.",
      "A financial path forward for ManU is tough to chart. Among the academy graduates, Mainoo seems to be the most saleable asset, and his value is debatable at the moment and is most likely greatest as a homegrown member of the squad. Abandoning the 343 (or however you want to characterize Amorim’s system) and hiring a manager to make better use of the talent already present — Mason Mount might qualify, for example — while the rebuild proceeds in a more natural direction might be a good idea.",
      "What Manchester United needs is flexibility, and Amorim may not be able to provide that on the available transfer budget. Or willing to provide it at all. On the other hand, they won’t have the bother of Europe next season.\nChris C, Toon Army DC (Ambivalent over the playoff final. LALAS or derbies? Both are wonderful.)",
      "",
      "Over the United fatalism\nWhat did we learn out of the Europa League final that we didn’t already know? Honest question…",
      "A United team which has been poor for six-odd months was poor again and lost. The overall depth and quality of a team which is shoddy in defence, lacks bite and control in midfield, and has next-to-no goals in it was, you guessed it, shoddy in defence, lacked bite and control in midfield and drew a blank.",
      "Spurs, to their credit, were able to be slightly less poor on the night and unconvincingly accounted for the worst United side in 50 years.",
      "Well done.",
      "But can we put a pin in the Manchester United fatalism? No United fan is happy with where the Club sits, how it’s being managed and how it’s performing – but maybe, just maybe, this is the opportunity to properly, actually reset the Club has needed for years.",
      "No papering over the cracks, no playing dress-ups at the big table of European football, no fixtures and competitions we’re nowhere near good enough to properly compete in for now…",
      "This is the chance to start a build we should’ve undertaken post-Jose. A proper, top-to-bottom rebuild. The open-heart surgery Rangnick diagnosed.",
      "Easier said than done, sure, and a far from linear process… but a chance to move beyond the quick fix, short term vanity signings which have plagued us for years and look for players who a/ fit a profile and method of play and b/ are not signing to pump up their pensions.",
      "And before anyone starts, if rival fans seriously think there’s no allure to signing for and becoming a Manchester United star, you’re kidding yourself. So let’s find the players for whom that means something.",
      "Come in, be a part of something from the ground up and be a reason this Club turns things around. It’s Manchester United – something which has always meant something and still does, no matter how loudly opposition fans protest it doesn’t.",
      "And on the fatalism… worst case for Manchester United is results get so dire the Glazers sell up and f**k off. Which would be a magnificent result – maybe the single worst result for the Club’s rivals, to be honest.",
      "It’s pretty easy to support your team when the going is good. For all the disappointments in recent times they’ve given me plenty to cheer about across the journey… I now hope they can begin the slow march back towards contention at home and abroad.\nSean Peter-Budge, Melbourne, Australia",
      "",
      "Suck it up\nGet a grip.",
      "This is my message to my fellow Man Utd fans.",
      "We are in the ‘find out’ phase of a decade and a half of chronic incompetence; mistakes compounded by mistakes; a relentless pursuit of a sunken cost fallacy brought on by our arrogance, impatience and an overbearing weight of expectation.",
      "We have chopped and changed managers and gameplans every 3yrs never allowing for any true synergy between manager and squad. We have signed players based on reputation and commercial viability with leveraged transfer fees that we still owe around £300m on. We have doled out massive, long term contracts to panic buys & ‘marquee’ signings which has had the knock on effect of massively inflating wages throughout the squad. Basically, think of any clichéd football mistake and we have made it repeatedly. Of course we’re shite!",
      "Our situation right now has been inevitable for a long time. What we need to do now is shut up, take our medicine and be patient. If you need somewhere to focus your frustration and anger about it all, the Glazers should be the target. INEOS haven’t been perfect (SJR’s petty cuts towards the ordinary folk at the club are pointless besides demonstrating that he is a monumental tw*t) but they have been sound so far with transfers; Yoro, Dorgu, Ugarte, Zirkzee and Heaven have all looked good so far.",
      "The last thing we need to do is sack Amorim. We need a period of continuity where we have a plan and we stick to it. There are too many mitigating factors to confidently say that he is the problem.",
      "343 looks like the incoming paradigm so remoulding our squad to fit it is a sound, forward thinking plan even if we do eventually move on from Amorim.",
      "Amorim being pragmatic and adapting to the players we have would just be repeating Erik Ten Hag’s mistake. Form would improve then inevitably tank as he tries to transition to his style. He’d get sacked anyway, the next manager would inherit another Frankenstein squad and we’ll be back to square one. Better to just push ahead with his ideas and get the most painful phase out the way first. We will improve when he has more suitable players.",
      "Being out of Europe gives us an opportunity to cull the squad this summer. If we set our target for next season to a top 10 finish, we can be more bold with game time for academy players and aim lower (with a much broader pool) for signings with an emphasis on suitability for the system.",
      "We are in a reset phase where our expectations need to be adjusted to give us time & space to lay new foundations.",
      "There is reason for optimism but stop expecting it all to happen immediately. The boat has sailed on any hope of a quick fix. We now need to be methodical and precise.",
      "And for those of us who grew up in the glory days, now is the time to prove for once and for all that we are not glory hunters.\nTom, Tooting",
      "",
      "Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes\nI read recently to my dismay and bitter disappointment that Amorim said he did not intend to change anything. If this is true, it would the most irresponsible and uncaring statement a Head Coach can make.",
      "Under Amorim’s reign, Man United have set and broken all sorts of unwanted, undesired and humiliating records.  Most United fans are hurting and, for the Head Coach to say he would not change anything, is more than an insult.",
      "Results and performances don’t lie. Clearly, his system, tactics, mass rotation, team selection and substitutions have, by and large, failed. In my profession, as it is in all other professions and areas of human endeavour, if the situation is retrogressing, changes are identified and made. I don’t belong to the school of thought which advocates the unnecessary sacking of coaches but, if Amorim’s publicly professed contention is not to make changes, then he must leave. No changes would lead to more pain next season and that is not acceptable.",
      "I urge all United fans and everyone who has interest in our beloved club to impress upon Amorim to make effective changes. Changes constitute a ‘sini qua non’ for success.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",
      "",
      "Compare and contrast\nGood morning",
      "Please compare Liverpool and ManU’s deroute and ways of tackling them during their respective transitions. What errors have the two clubs made? What good things have they done? Why was the transition in Liverpool ultimately a success, while it doesn’t look too good for ManU? Where have ManU repeated the errors made by LFC? And why haven’t they learned anything from history?",
      "And probably many more questions.",
      "Thanks",
      "Kind regards\nMichael from Denmark  – LFC-fan,  but curious about the similarities between the two mastodons and their situations (both Hicks/Gilette and the Glazers are nincompoops!)."

      "Initially, the British billionaire’s takeover was met with overwhelming positivity, but this has swiftly eroded as he’s made several brutal cuts.",
      "One of Ratcliffe’s priorities has been to cut costs at Old Trafford and while this is necessary, some cuts have been deemed overly severe as morale at the club has taken a severe hit.",

      "Around 250 staff were dismissed last summer and a further 200 individuals ‘will discover if they have lost their jobs today’.",

      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing Erik ten Hag at the end of 2024, losing 16 of his 41 matches in all competitions.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon initially wanted to join Man Utd at the end of this season, but INEOS pushed for him to arrive immediately and this has backfired.",
      "The 40-year-old has attempted to implement a new system in the middle of the season and has unsurprisingly found this incredibly difficult with Man Utd’s squad unsuited to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Without ready-made wing-backs or suitable No.10s, Man Utd’s system has been ineffective for months as they have been toothless in attack.",
      "READ: Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "Man Utd could still finish 17th in the Premier League this season and they were dealt a severe blow on Wednesday night, losing 1-0 to Spurs in the Europa League final to miss out on a trophy and Champions League football.",
      "Carragher thinks Man Utd chiefs need to start asking whether they ‘appointed the wrong manager at the wrong time’.",
      "‘At some point during their post-season review of a dire campaign, someone in the Manchester United boardroom will need the courage to ask the toughest question: “Did we appoint the wrong manager at the wrong time?”’ Carragher wrote for The Telegraph.",
      "‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe may still believe Ruben Amorim is one of the best young coaches of his generation. He may think that, had Amorim not joined United last November, he would have been hired by another top European club and excelled.",
      "‘He may also be sure that if United had the same funds to rebuild the team as Amorim’s predecessors had at their disposal, it would be a question of when, not if, United return to the top of the English and European game.",
      "‘But in the aftermath of a dismal Europa League final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, the dilemma around Amorim is more complicated than for any of those who have tried and failed at Old Trafford since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.’",
      "Carragher has also floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Amorim and Man Utd amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "‘Now that his six months in charge have gone so badly, Ratcliffe and his Ineos colleagues will need a decisive plan for how he will navigate the club through the most challenging period in United’s modern history,’ Carragher continued.",
      "‘Their grave concern must be that they have seen absolutely no evidence so far to suggest he is up to it. On that basis, backing Amorim this summer may be the honourable option, but it is not necessarily the bravest.",
      "‘Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.’",
      "He added: ‘The much-anticipated tactical innovations, and development of younger players, have been non-existent.",
      "‘The only successful game-changing strategy Amorim has offered is throwing Harry Maguire up front for the final few minutes of European games.’",
      "Neville has urged Amorim to “wipe out” one Man Utd and to “stop doing the honourable thing” after defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "It will be far cheaper to sack Ruben Amorim than keep him at Manchester United and Arne Slot has ‘chucked one of his own under the bus’.",

      "Not quite. He just said, “I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute he was on training ground. In my opinion there were certain moments he could do more, to put it mildly. I told him he’s a much better defender than people think, but you don’t show it all the time.”",
      "Which is a) hardly a particularly controversial thing for a new manager to say to a player, and most importantly b) not the full quote, despite that being all the MailOnline offers.",

      "“Maybe he said it himself, he’s going to leave either way so why not tell. Maybe it’s already a first gift I can give Xabi Alonso. But I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute how he was on the training ground. In my opinion in certain moments he could do a bit more, to say it mildly, and that’s what we talked about.",
      "“Combined with that I said to him: ‘You are a much better defender than everybody tells you, unfortunately you don’t show it all the time, that’s why people sometimes say you are not’.",
      "“If he is just at it and focused and concentrated, there are not many players that can go around him, because he’s fast, he’s agile, he has great mentality.",
      "“But it’s about showing that every single game, because in this world we are judged not only on the 34 games we do well, we are mainly judged on the four games we don’t do so well.",
      "“These things we spoke about in pre-season.”",
      "Again, it sounds a hell of a lot like an incoming coach having some pretty standard, constructive observations about one of his new players. And the best bit is that Slot’s answer was prefaced with this line, which changes everything completely:",
      "“I think Mo has said already a few things about why he was in my office in pre-season and there were similar reasons why Trent was in my office in the beginning of the season!”",
      "So this was in pre-season and Slot had similar conversations with Salah, who recently explained: “He showed me a few videos of myself in the warm-up. I was like quite slow, didn’t do much. Then he showed me, ‘look at the second [player] after he sees you take it easy, look at the third one’. Then you see the whole line walking like me and he said, ‘that’s your influence on the team’.”",

      "Former Man Utd defender Wes Brown insists that Andre Onana will still be at Old Trafford next season as he tells fans it’s “not like a video game”.",
      "The Red Devils have had a terrible season under Ruben Amorim – who replaced Erik ten Hag in November – with Man Utd currently 16th in the Premier League heading into the final weekend of action.",
      "Amorim’s side had the opportunity on Wednesday to put an awful campaign behind them by winning the Europa League but Tottenham beat them 1-0 to pile more misery and pressure on the Man Utd boss.",
      "Red Devils goalkeeper Onana has been one of a number of underperforming players this term and there have been rumours he could be sold this summer.",
      "However, the chances of Man Utd recouping the £47m that they paid Inter Milan for Onana are very slim and ex-Red Devils defender Brown insists fans have to realise that selling a player is not as easy as “pressing one button”.",
      "Brown told bestbettingsites.co.uk: “Yeah, I think you have to. Listen, he’s made some mistakes this season and you don’t want that from a goalkeeper. But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors.",
      "“And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "The INEOS brains trust can only be trusted with one more decision\nAs a United fan who didn’t even bother watching the Europa League final, I’m not the least bit surprised by the outcome. Manchester United are in complete shambles right now. The arrival of Ratcliffe has been so disastrous that even Ed Woodward starts to look like a footballing genius in comparison.",
      "United’s problems are numerous, but the most glaring issue is this: we can’t even decide what’s worse — the players or the managers. When it comes to both Erik ten Hag and Amorim, it’s safe to say that, as poor as the current squad is, the managers have been even worse. And therein lies the root of our troubles.",
      "We have no Director of Football. Our scouting network is non-existent or laughable at best. This leaves the manager (the one who can’t do their own jobs) to also do the scouting, resulting in hundreds of millions wasted on signings who have consistently failed to meet expectations. Under Ten Hag, huge sums were spent chasing his priority targets, yet almost every one of them has proven to be a disappointment. In contrast, Amorin is still demadning players for a system that has shown no evidence of working in the Premier League.",
      "The reality? United are expected to finish this season with 39 points — just above the relegation zone. In many other seasons, that would have meant relegation. Remember the outrage when United finished 7th under David Moyes, and that was without the financial backing ETH was given for instance.",
      "So what’s the solution?",
      "Unfortunately, the current management structure is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon. There will be no Director of Football appointment, no meaningful improvement to the scouting network, and no overhaul of the training facilities. The people in charge simply don’t seem capable of making the right decisions.",
      "This leaves us with only one viable option — one that comes with the caveat that it has not worked out too well in the past but is the only realistic path forward now. We need to hire an experienced, truly elite manager. Someone with a proven track record of winning titles and the full backing of the club. This manager should be entrusted with all football decisions — from which players to buy and sell, to upgrading facilities, restructuring the medical team, and establishing a reliable scouting and data analysis network.",
      "Most importantly, this manager must be given complete autonomy, no matter how much resistance or dissent there may be from players, he must be backed to the hilt season after season. Because the only thing the current board and management can be trusted with is one decision only, hiring the manager. And that too out of sheer necessity. Beyond that, let the only adult at the club (read: new manager hopefully) make all the decisions from thereon. Because, this United board and management have proven repeatedly that to allow them to make even a single more decision would be folly of the highest order.\nAdeel",

      "So, for the third season in a row, United found themselves in a cup final looking to salvage their season, only this time, they went to the well and they found there was nothing left for them.",
      "You can’t keep putting off the inevitable. This is a large scale rebuild. It will involve gradually shipping out 10 players and trying to bring in 10 who are an improvement on those going out. That’s a 3, 4, 5 year project. There is no quick fix. There are no shortcuts. The last two years have been sticking plasters, but you can’t keep putting plasters on open fractures. Sooner or later you have to accept that you require more advanced help.",
      "As I have said previously, the problem with United is that are yet to confront their reality. They may have the most Instagram followers in Kenya or whatever, but that is worth absolutely nothing on a football pitch. They need to accept where they are and what they are. Until they do, they will continue to go backwards.\nAndy H, Swansea.",

It feels like a death knell and I expect a lot of black worn at Old Trafford on Sunday for the blessed relief of the season finale. We didn’t deserve to win the Europa and certainly do not deserve Champions League football in 2025-26.",

I wish I could express the same confident claim about my own club, but I for one just cannot see an escape out of this doom spiral.",

The last time we were relegated in 1974, it was only six years after becoming England’s first champions of Europe. With greater finances involved in modern football, it has insulated us for longer, but not for much longer, at this rate in any case. I will never stop loving my club and all its glorious (and inglorious) history, but I am really not looking forward to more of the same next season.",

I was thinking earlier this season, as a Liverpool fan, that if somehow they got relegated I would quit watching football or caring about the Premier League altogether (not the Champions League of course….) because it would be meaningless to entertain a rivalry when your biggest rival has been destroyed beyond repair. Of course, they didn’t get relegated -but gave it shot- yet United being United, they managed to produce an outcome just as humiliating and unbelievable; lose a European final to Tottenham. (To add insult to injury, without Maddison, Kulusevski, Bergvall…. basically, their best attacking options) 🤯",
      "Lost a European final to Tottenham… (try not to laugh reading that over and over again). They will have to live with that stain forever now. The last European trophy Spurs won was against Anderlecht, a club which fittingly has disappeared from the world stage. How do you live past that as a “proud football club” when Tottenham was the perennial butt of jokes for a reason?? Even hours before the match Paul Scholes was asked to revisit on TV the “lads, it’s Tottenham” pep talk Fergie gave them in the dressing room which became a meme, running joke, soundbite whatever to exemplify the complete helplessness and failure inherent to Tottenham. And yet, you’ve become their b****, Spurs beat them 4 times this season!!! 🤣",
      "In the end of the day, level at league titles and with twice as many European cups, the history books will tell the story that Liverpool beat Tottenham in a Champions League final but Manchester United lost to Spurs in a Europa League final. There are levels to this game. Liverpool has to find a new “biggest fixture” to look forward to because the English Derby no longer is. We may have to manufacture a rivalry with City going forward because United died this season. They’re just the gift that keeps on giving, having perfected the art of failure.

      "",
      "We do talk about Bruno\nI was really glad one of your 16 Conclusions on the final picked up on the double Bruno Fernandes turnover in the Spurs half prior to the goal. This gets glossed over so many times, especially when United play well or get a result. The amount of times he gives the ball away unnecessarily is astonishing.",
      "It got me to thinking after the game. If Fernandes were the talisman he is reputed to be. If he’s such a great goal scorer, creator, leader, why have none of the big clubs not come in for him? At the very least, why has there not been the odd rumour at the end of a non-disastrous season, linking him with Spain, Italy or Bayern?",
      "I think the answer to this is that they don’t want him. Is he a good player? Absolutely! But he’s not good enough to be constantly forgiven his wasteful passes, Hollywood balls, whining and moaning at the ref and team mates? I can’t understand how the 6 managers (interim included) he’s worked under since joining United have all deemed him undroppable. Not just that, he’s rarely subbed off",
      "United are in a very precarious position right now. There was talk earlier this season of a relegation battle. I shrugged that off, thinking there’s no way the quality of the teams at the bottom of the table would threaten a side of full internationals. But watching the game last night I could honestly say that I wouldn’t put a tenner on United to beat any of the 3 relegated sides if they were to meet in a week’s time with full strength sides. I don’t think the teams coming up this season from the Championship will be as bad as the 3 going down and I think Leeds and Burnley will have learned their lessons form previous bounces and prepare better for the upcoming top flight season.",
      "So if United want to keep doing the same thing, with the same players, then I genuinely feel next season could be worse than this. And if Bruno Fernandes is still the captain, playing 90 mins every week, no matter how bad his performances are, then they can have no complaints if next May they find themselves in must win matches to avoid dropping to the championship.",
      "I would like to clarify that I’m not laying all the blame for the current sh*t show at his feet. There are a number of players not fit to wear the shirt and the managers have to take a lot of blame too. But this is one area that seems to be constantly ignored and needs to be debated. Are United better off with Fernandes or without. Some fans might see Fernandes leaving as the last finger pulled from the dyke but I think his removal from the team would allow others to step up with an increased focus on in-game tactics. Just look what happened PSG when Mbappe left and the team became less of a one man show.\nMick, Newcastle",

      "It’s the final Premier League weekend of the season and that means it’s permutations time as the European places are settled, but to be honest we’re far more interested in joining the great big party that’ll be going off at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Liverpool v Crystal Palace\nLook, are there bigger and more important games on this weekend? Yes. Pretty much all of them in one way or another.",
      "But how often do any of us get the chance to watch a Premier League game that is less football match and more massive communal party? It will end with Liverpool receiving the Premier League trophy they won bloody ages ago now by beating a Tottenham team that – and this is impossible to imagine now – was in the grip of a banterously long trophy drought.",
      "But it isn’t just the home team having a big party here, with Crystal Palace also jubilant having sauntered past 50 Premier League points for the first time ever and also if less importantly won the FA Cup to nab their first ever piece of major silverware.",
      "Just a game where a lovely time can be had by all. Get Palace to bring the FA Cup with them. Delay the kick-off because everyone is just too busy giving each other guards of honour.",
      "The (very tenuously semi-) serious point here is that this should be one of the most happily cigars out and flip-flops on football matches ever staged and thus has rich potential to be one of those proper end-of-season games that ends 5-5 or some such silliness, where by the end the delirious fans of both teams are cheering every goal and wondering how on earth they’re going to make it to August with only transfer bumwash and the unwanted Club World Cup to sustain us.",
      "Other sadly untelevised but very live contenders for 5-5 style shenanigans on the final day include but are not limited to: Wolves v Brentford, Fulham v Man City and of course Tottenham v Brighton.",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Nottingham Forest\nBy far the most interesting of the Champions League chasers by simple virtue of novelty, while we also can’t deny we enjoy the fact that the Premier League could send interlopers off to the Big Cup for two years in a row, and those teams both in fact be former winners of said cup from before football was invented.",
      "Alas, a team that had everything safely in their own hands, spending much of the season in the top three, has wobbled sufficiently to leave their chances of a top-five finish now on the slender side.",
      "Even a month ago, Forest were sitting pretty in fourth, with a game in hand that could take them back above Man City and a three-point lead over Chelsea in sixth.",
      "Four games and five points later, they are on the outside looking in. The fact they face Chelsea on the final day is a half-full or half-empty situation depending on how you choose to view it.",
      "While they face undeniably the hardest task of the five teams scrapping for the remaining three places alongside Liverpool, Arsenal and – stop giggling – Tottenham in next season’s Champions League, they do at least know that a win for them automatically takes care of one of the two failures they need from a rival.",
      "If Forest take care of their own business they just need a stumble from Villa or Newcastle. And while Forest’s form has stalled – although it has by no means been a total collapse – they have had enough memorable days at the City Ground this season to believe they can deliver one last blow to the establishment, if only to save Nuno Espirito Santo from another confrontation with an angry iPhone 7-wielding owner.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Ruben Amorim\nOne of the great unique elements about the final day is the vast chasm in importance it can carry for two clubs in the same game.",
      "Sure, your Nottingham Forest v Chelseas are great, all-to-play-for head-to-heads that can determine the success or failure of entire seasons. And we’ve already dispensed with our usual miserabilism to look fondly at the great big party that’s about to go off at Anfield for Premier League winners Liverpool and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace.",
      "But perhaps the most fun final-day games are those between teams still fighting for a big prize and those who have just had their dreams crushed to dirt by the only club in the entire country that might be as ridiculous as they are.",
      "Step forward, Manchester United and their beleaguered life-choices-reconsidering manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The good news for Amorim and the lads is that they will almost certainly avoid the ignominy of finishing 17th even in the very likely event that they cannot rouse themselves from Wednesday night’s disappointment in Bilbao to stop an in-form, Champions League-chasing Aston Villa.",
      "But that’s only because Tottenham’s preparation for their own final game of the season against Brighton has been comprised entirely of memes, full-kit wankering, beer, cigars, parades and settling 17-year-old scores with Domino’s Pizza.",
      "While last-laugh-having Postecoglou faces the challenge of identifying his 11 least hungover players, Amorim and his team face an altogether different kind of headache.",
      "There is a grim fascination to be had in watching just what kind of performance Amorim and United are able to pluck from their arse against a very good side with no thoughts yet of the beach. We have a strong suspicion that the answer is ‘sh*tbone awful’ but, while nothing can be done now to save a season that saw all its remaining eggs trampled under Cristian Romero’s boots on Wednesday, a broken club in utter disarray could do with at least something to send them into the summer with some vague hope that things might be all right in the end.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Cole Palmer\nSympathy for Chelsea is not something generally in great supply, but there is some to be found for Enzo Maresca and his players as they attempt to manage their way through a frankly unprecedented set of circumstances.",
      "As almost everyone else’s season winds down, or in many cases has long since already wound down, the Blues face a decisive Champions League six-pointer at Forest on Sunday, then a European final three days later, and then after a moment to catch their breath head off to the States for the Club World Cup that absolutely everybody definitely wanted and needed and is in no way just a giant player-flogging FIFA cash cow.",
      "In circumstances like these, it is entirely unhelpful for your only real recognised number nine to bag himself a three-game suspension. Nicolas Jackson has done just that, though, and is still out for the vital trip to the City Ground.",
      "With Christopher Nkunku and Marc Guiu also out or at the very best extremely doubtful, the challenge of getting Chelsea over the line here before turning attention to the uncommonly large and important challenges that still await them in this never-ending season falls on the likes of Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho, back in contention here having been ineligible for the win over Manchester United.",
      "It really is a time when Chelsea could do with Palmer stepping up after a Difficult Second Season. Or Difficult Second Half Of Second Season, more fairly.",
      "Last month’s from-behind win at Fulham was, absurdly, Chelsea’s first and only Premier League away win since a 4-3 caper at Tottenham in early December. It’s a 10-game run in which Chelsea have scored only five goals and been shut out six times.",
      "Palmer himself hasn’t scored a Premier League goal away from home since opening the scoring in a 1-1 draw at Palace on the first weekend of January. That came near the end of a run of seven goals in nine Premier League games.",
      "His only goal since that run was a nerve-settling late penalty in the 3-1 win over a partying Liverpool.",
      "Sunday, at a team with the joint best home defensive record in the league, would be a fine time to step up. And unlike at almost every other club in the country, it’s even quite a useful time to get back into form for the further challenges that lie immediately ahead.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Sheffield United v Sunderland\nWe’ve already had a curious taste of a play-off final style game thanks to the unique circumstances that turned this year’s Europa League final into a Champions League play-off, with much attention given to the financial prize on offer and the chance for one of the two teams to spend next season being ritually humiliated at a higher level for which they are painfully ill-equipped and unprepared.",
      "So yeah, nothing at all like the Championship play-off final. Hopefully this will be at least a more watchable and entertaining game than we saw in Bilbao, and the Championship play-off final does traditionally deliver on that front.",
      "There’s no chance of a new club in the Premier League this time around with Sheffield United and Sunderland bidding to join other familiar faces from Leeds and Burnley.",
      "Sunderland would bring the greater novelty having not been seen in the top flight since 2017 and spending a good few years of the interim down in League One, but it’s Sheffield United – automatic promotion contenders for most of the season – who will start as favourites.",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Napoli v Cagliari\nWe generally try to avoid Friday night games but the Serie A title race is clearly the place to go this weekend and that means Friday night lights are our only option as Napoli and Inter scrap it out for the title.",
      "Both slipped up last weekend, leaving Napoli a point clear and with destiny still in their own hands as they seek a second title success in three years. Victory over Cagliari will do the job, delivering Antonio Conte a Serie A title with a third club after also tasting glory with Inter and Juventus.",
      "In a wildly out-of-character move, Conte has fallen out with the suits at Napoli which means this might be a brief yet glorious reign.",

      "This is the club he ‘loves’ and that gives Manchester United a transfer advantage they will maximise by meeting his £62.5m release clause.",
      "The Brazilian will not be the first to do so, nor the most expensive. But he will find himself among these, the biggest ever signings involving a player joining a club lower in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante – £32m in July 2016",
      "From: Leicester (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (10th)",
      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",

      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",

      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",

      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",

      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",

      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",

      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester City want to sign a Newcastle star to replace one of their stalwarts for the Club World Cup and beyond.",
      "Mason Mount’s big night in Europe could spark a renaissance, with the Man Utd star and seven more Big Six strugglers set for an upturn next season…",

      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",

      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let [Marcus] Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",

      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "It had to be him. On the crucial final day of the season, Scott McTominay got Napoli's Serie A title parade going with the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Cagliari. It has been the story of his and the club's campaign.",
      "Earlier this season, the Scot was asked about what his favourite nickname among the Napoli fanbase is. He was given a selection - and two stood out.",
      "One was 'McFratm'. It's the Neapolitan word for 'brother' - the Napoli faithful now revere the 28-year-old as one of the family.",
      "The other nickname: 'apribottiglie'. It means bottle opener - handed to him due to the sheer number of times he has given Napoli the lead. He gets the party started. He did exactly that when his team needed it most in the 2-0 win against Cagliari on Friday night, when his team required one win to claim the title.",
      "Nicknames are a big deal at the Naples club. Before his departure to Paris Saint-Germain in January, Kvicha Kvaratskhelia's talents were so unique he earned the term 'Kvaradona'. It's some honour given Diego Maradona's status literally hangs over the club.",
      "But now McTominay is the one with hero status.",
      "And for good reason. Despite Kvaratskhelia's departure, the arrivals of Antonio Conte and Romelu Lukaku to the club over the past year, the Scottish midfielder is the main reason why Napoli have their hands on another Scudetto title.",
      "His 18 goal contributions is the most from a midfielder in a Serie A debut season. It’s three more than Kaka during his first term at AC Milan.",
      "And in Napoli's run-in, McTominay was the bottle opener, starting the scoring in three consecutive league games in April against Empoli, Monza and Torino.",
      "He has been crucial in picking up points during decisive matches all season, scoring in the first game against title rivals Inter - yes, that was an opener too.",
      "And even though Napoli limped over the line for the title during the back end of the season, McTominay more than played his part. He basically carried them through. For example, in the 2-2 draw with Genoa a fortnight ago, he set up both goals - again, to put them ahead.",
      "McTominay has been vital in this title-winning team, which some Manchester United fans may struggle to believe. Reliable and consistent? Yes. But two goals behind top scorer Lukaku?",
      "Not everyone is stunned by this. \"How you can sell Scott is beyond me,\" former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said this season. McTominay also scored seven Premier League goals last season and was a penalty area threat under Erik ten Hag.",
      "But his 12 goals this season is one of many key metrics that have gone up since leaving Manchester United.",
      "One of them is minutes. McTominay has been trusted more by Napoli this term than in any season at Old Trafford - and even more so compared to Erik ten Hag's two full seasons at United.",
      "But there has been a position tweak too. At Napoli, McTominay has been handed a more attacking role, similar to his status as a No 10 for Scotland. In the 0-0 draw against Parma last week, he was even handed a role on the left wing - which of course used to be Kvaratskhelia's position.",
      "As a result, McTominay has been even more of an attacking presence. He has created twice as many chances in the league compared to last season at Manchester United.",
      "He takes players on five times as much as last term, while his pressing numbers have multiplied by more than four.",
      "Where was this at Old Trafford? Firstly, there is the feeling that McTominay was misunderstood as a player. The Scot was often used as a deeper midfield option at Old Trafford - sometimes even the deepest.",
      "A period playing as a centre-back for the Scotland national team didn't help United's cause - but how they failed to spot his potential higher up when Steve Clarke pushed him further up to being a regular goal threat.",
      "Of course, Bruno Fernandes was United's standout No 10 in McTominay's prominent years at United. But it only adds to the frustration of letting a talent like McTominay's go. He was not just misunderstood - but also overlooked.",
      "He is not the only United player currently revelling in success elsewhere while Ruben Amorim's side languish in crisis mode. McTominay has a Scudetto title to his name, Antony will take part in next week's Conference League final - which Jadon Sancho could be involved in as well.",
      "Dean Henderson has a FA Cup trophy to his name with Crystal Palace, while Anthony Elanga has justified his move to Nottingham Forest. Marcus Rashford looks better off and sharper at Aston Villa, with Tyrell Malacia a recently-crowned Dutch champion at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "None of the above will hurt more than McTominay though. This was a United academy product - and remember this club has had one of those in every matchday squad since 1937 - winning a major trophy elsewhere, after bidding an emotional goodbye to the club nearly a year ago.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho's futures also up in the air this summer, it will hit home as to whether United is an appropriate development ground for those that come through."

      "Fresh from a 10/1 winner in midweek, our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his Premier League insight across the final round of matches.",
      "Chelsea are the vulnerable ones in the final day race for the Champions League.",
      "Based on their soft underbelly away from home, winning just one of their last 10 Premier League games, this is a great spot for Nottingham Forest.",
      "A criticism of Enzo Maresca this season has been the predictability of Chelsea's play and that is more apparent when you remove Nicholas Jackson from the equation as he does bring a bit of surprise and directness to what Chelsea are trying to serve up. Forest's defensive duo of Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo will fancy their chances of another shutout.",
      "Forest to win to nil is 5/1 with Sky Bet and it's a bet that's landed in seven of their last 15 Premier League home games against the likes of Man City, Man Utd, Spurs, Crystal Palace and Brighton. It's worth a nibble.",
      "But the best bet lies in the shots market.",
      "If you exclude the relegated clubs, only Brentford and West Ham concede more home shots than Nottingham Forest. Marc Cucurella has been one of Chelsea's most consistent operators all season and he comes into this having a shot in 22 of his last 31 appearances, averaging 0.90 shots per-90 across the whole season.",
      "In a game Chelsea need to win, he'll be to the fore of their attacking process and is 10/11 with Sky Bet to have at least one shot.",
      "Over the past 10 seasons, the final day of the Premier League season has averaged 3.41 goals per game - 87 per cent of those matches have featured over 1.5 goals and 65 per cent have delivered over 2.5 goals. Over those 10 years, the average goal on the final matchday increases 0.6 per match from the overall average total goal count per match. That's a big spike.",
      "Teams are more likely to play with a bit more freedom in a no-pressure environment. It's attack-minded football to the fore. And this game just screams a mad scoreline.",
      "Final-day games have the tendency to go into overdrive in terms of a scoreline. Remember Crystal Palace 5-3 Bournemouth in 2019? Or Tottenham 5-4 Leicester in 2018? How about Hull City 1-7 Tottenham in 2017? And there was relegated Southampton drawing 4-4 Liverpool last season.",
      "On the final day it can pay to play the big lines, so over 5.5 goals at 7/2 with Sky Bet is certainly a runner.",
      "Villa are finishing the season like title contenders and this is a fixture sent from heaven for them. You couldn't hand-pick a more welcoming host.",
      "Unai Emery has got Villa so well-drilled. They've won seven of their last eight Premier League games with their only defeat being a last-minute goal at Manchester City. The underlying process has been the best in the entire division over that stretch, especially in defence where their 0.85 expected goals against per 90 is unmatched.",
      "Manchester United are guaranteed their lowest finish since promotion to the top-flight in 1975 and the home fans will be preparing the tomatoes for the lap of honour at the end of the final game.",
      "Villa to win to nil at 9/4 with Sky Bet has a great chance.",
      "Only once in Premier League history has a team entered the final day in a Champions League place and failed to qualify.",
      "Newcastle will be there with a win. A point will be enough if Forest vs Chelsea ends in a draw or Villa fail to win.",
      "Eddie Howe's team are a reliable bunch at home, winning their last six at St James' Park, scoring 20 goals.",
      "If they win this, it will be their most points (41) and most wins (13) at home in a Premier League campaign since 2003. It's hard to see anything but the 1/3 with Sky Bet landing - but how do we get a palatable price? The goalscorer market looks the place to be with Sandro Tonali the standout at 11/2 to score anytime. He has scored three in his last five home games as the Toon faithful do seem to inspire him.",
      "After the season Manchester City have had, is trusting them at 4/7 with Sky Bet to win away from home really a wise decision?",
      "City have won just one away game against teams currently in the top 12, which was a 2-0 win at Chelsea. And Fulham have an impressive home record this season against teams currently in the top nine, winning five of their eight games.",
      "This is officially their best Premier League season so the market is disrespecting them slightly with 4/1 with Sky Bet on offer for the home win.",
      "I'm going to meet in the middle and back the draw at 16/5 with Sky Bet as a point will be enough for City in their Champions League qualification pursuit due to their superior goal difference over Villa.",
      "Spurs at bigger than 3/1 with Sky Bet is a real tempter. The market has gone completely overboard with the hangover factor from midweek and is offering up very tantalising prices on the home win.",
      "Spurs of course have lost 21 of 37 Premier League games but this just might be a bigger game for Ange Postecoglou than what the market is predicting.",
      "You get the impression he really wants to keep this job to try and build this Spurs team. As a manager he isn't going to get an opportunity like this anywhere else with the infrastructure and spending power on offer at Spurs - everything is set there behind the scenes to be a regular challenger.",
      "So, it's in his interest to make sure his team finish the season with a bit of positive momentum to take into those talks with Daniel Levy.",
      "And Brighton don't need to win this match. A point would be enough to finish eighth which gives them an outside chance of Conference League qualification. Brighton's defensive record still worries me too, conceding 16 goals in their last eight games to an expected goals against process of 1.8 per game which is borderline relegation levels of form.",
      "With a high-scoring draw a big runner, the double chance on Spurs at 5/4 with Sky Bet looks a big price.",
      "This has the potential to go down an extreme correct score route, such is the extra possibilities of goals on the final day.",
      "Incredibly though, Bournemouth have only scored more than one goal in just one of their last 13 home matches, which tells you everything you need to know about why they've fallen short in their play to make European football. There has been a huge underperformance at play when assessing their expected goals output though, scoring 13 goals in the last 13 when their expected goals figure is at 21.8.",
      "This might be the game where they bring those metrics closer together and give the Foxes a bit of a battering.",
      "The -2 handicap for Bournemouth makes appeal at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Being wrong is part of the job. It's something anyone in this line of work must accept.",
      "However, tipping Leif Davis to be the top assister in the Premier League at the start of the season at 100/1 turned out to be a new level of wrong. Much like Ipswich on the whole, he has been so disappointing in trying to make the step-up after ripping through League One and the Championship.",
      "He has bagged just two assists this season but there were signs of life from him at Leicester last weekend from an attacking standpoint, having two shots and a goal ruled out. He is 9/4 with Sky Bet to score or assist in a game that should be full of goalmouth action.",
      "Your mind always must be looking ahead in this game and one of the angles I'm most excited about backing next season is Declan Rice's total goals output.",
      "He could become one of Arsenal's top goalscorers next season playing in this attack-minded No 8 role and I'd be a confident backer at any price for him to improve on the total of four he's bagged in the Premier League this season. He is 7/2 with Sky Bet to score for the third league game running at St Mary's.",
      "We saw a little snapshot of Vitor Pereira not holding back in criticising his players in public following the 4-2 defeat to Crystal Palace. He's done some amazing work since joining but doubts remain about whether he can rein in his combustible nature to make his tenure one that will work in the longer term.",
      "It's hard to see how Wolves can stop Brentford scoring multiple goals in this one.",
      "The over 3.5 goals line looks attractive at 5/4 with Sky Bet, as does Yoane Wissa scoring at 11/8. The striker has landed for punters in this market in five of his last six games and has shown this season that there are few better around than him in front of goal in the Premier League. He can get his 20th goal of the campaign.",

      "\"It looks, I think more likely than not, that he'll move on this summer. He has interest from pretty much every club in the league. I don't think there's many clubs in the world who wouldn't want to have him. So I think it's more likely than not that he'll move on.",
      "\"Of course, nothing's sorted, nothing's done or completed or even I think very, very, very close. That process will take its course.",
      "\"We'll, of course, be proud of the part that we've had in terms of Liam's development and his contribution this season.",

      "\"Liam Delap could be the bargain buy of the summer.",
      "\"The striker has hit double figures for goals in his first full crack at the Premier League and that is even more impressive considering the struggles his relegated Ipswich have had at this level.",
      "\"He has been the driving force to their attack, scoring from all angles and distances while also hauling the team up the pitch with his runs with and without the ball. It's this range of skills which makes him stand out.",
      "\"A frontman with the ability to hold up the ball while also rank among the top 25 Premier League players for take-ons is a rare thing. His overperformance of his Expected Goals total demonstrates his finishing ability. Delap is ready for the next step.",
      "\"Where that will be and how Delap would fit into a different system is intriguing. But it is no wonder there is big interest in the 22-year-old England youth international.",
      "\"His £30m release clause fee is way below the quoted price tag for some strikers on the continent linked with a move to the Premier League who would be something more of a risk. Investing in Delap appears to be a smart move.\""

      "The accepted wisdom is that Manchester United need to break the cycle of signing players for specific managers then ripping up and starting again when a change is required. But the worry is that minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe now risks perpetuating it.",
      "Amorim is not alone in using a back three, of course. But he is certainly in a minority among managers. Across all Premier League games this season, back fours have been used 77 per cent of the time, with back threes only used 23 per cent of the time.",
      "The same disparity can be seen in Europe. Simone Inzaghi may yet win the Champions League with a back three but Inter Milan are one of only two sides to reach this season's knockout stages who habitually use a three over four, the other being Amorim's former club Sporting, who are already onto their second appointment since his exit, with Rui Borges having replaced Joao Pereira.",
      "It is not that the system cannot work, it is just that the pool of potential successors to Amorim who actually use it is a small one. While Manchester United appear committed to their man, with no plans to make a change, the reality is that the moment will come, and it might be sooner than they hope.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta gave Kieran Tierney and Jorginho the chance to say goodbye to the Emirates Stadium with late cameos in last Sunday's 1-0 win over Newcastle but Raheem Sterling, another player set to depart this summer, was an unused substitute.",
      "It remains to be seen whether he will get any minutes at Southampton on the final day but, having been unable to make a mark during his loan spell from Chelsea, he looked a slightly incongruous presence during Arsenal's lap of appreciation.",
      "With more than 600 senior games in his legs, Sterling is approaching the twilight of his career at 30 but there was a reminder of just how special he was this week when Kevin De Bruyne picked him out as his favourite team-mate during an interview with Jamie Redknapp.",
      "Those runs have become increasingly rare. Sterling's playing time has dropped to a new low this season. Arsenal fans haven't seen him at anything close to his best and neither have those of Chelsea, where he still has a year left to run on his contract.",
      "Sterling is unlikely to ever get a send-off like his former team-mate De Bruyne but his outstanding achievements, as a player who ranks among the Premier League's top 20 for both goals and assists, with 123 and 65 respectively in 395 games, should not be forgotten even as his powers wane.",
      "Eberechi Eze was given most of the evening off against Wolves on Tuesday following his match-winning heroics in Crystal Palace's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City but he still made his mark, adding a superb fourth goal only five minutes after his introduction.",
      "Attention will soon turn to his future. He will not be short of suitors this summer. But for now, provided he is not playing against your team, it is best to just enjoy a player flourishing into one of the Premier League's best. He has been a pleasure to watch this season.",
      "Bruno Guimaraes' completeness was the focus of last week's column. There was also a look at how Arsenal have missed Kai Havertz and the importance of Mikkel Damsgaard's pressing to Brentford."

      "The teenage left-back's first Gunners start came in December but there was just something about him - his football arrogance, his ability to take the ball under pressure without fear or error and his consistency.",
      "Since then, he has become first-choice in that role and with England's left-back role at his feet too - a meteoric and unchallenged rise.",
      "And there is more to come - expect Lewis-Skelly to transition into midfield in the coming years.Sam Blitz",
      "Last season's top two, Man City and Arsenal, served up a pair of contrasting classics, starting with a bad-tempered, but intriguing four-goal classic at the Etihad in September that appeared to be going the visitors' way - that is, until John Stones's scrambled 98th-minute equaliser sent the home fans crazy, while breaking Gunners' hearts after almost holding on for the win since half-time with just 10 players.",
      "The return meeting at the Emirates in February may have lacked that tension, but the quality of Arsenal's five-star display that ripped the champions apart more than made up for it, with young left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly showing just why we selected him as our Young Player of the Year.",
      "However, our game of the season features the champions, although it is not their drama-filled 2-2 draw in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in February when James Tarkowski thundered home a 98th-minute equaliser that made the famous old ground shake.",
      "Rather it is Liverpool's visit to Newcastle United in early December that was this campaign's standout match and not just because it finished 3-3! The clash in the north east had all the ingredients that make up a classic, being played under the St James' Park lights, producing an electric atmosphere as a result, and plenty of goals, including a contender for strike of the season from Magpies forward Alexander Isak and then late drama when the hosts levelled matters.",
      "All in all, a real feast of football to showcase the brilliance of the Premier League.Rich Morgan",
      "\"The touch is as good as anything we will see in the Premier League this season. It's Messi-like.\"",

      "Matz Sels and David Raya have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League goalkeeper this season, so it should be of no surprise to see their names featuring heavily in this category.",
      "In fact, Sels' player-of-the-match performance to prevent Liverpool from taking all three points at Nottingham Forest in January features several world-class stops that all came under consideration.",
      "There were several other saves that caught the eye during the season, such as Emi Martinez displaying ridiculous reactions to prevent Chris Wood's header from crossing the line at the City Ground in December, Andre Onana diving full length to deny Crystal Palace's Ismaila Sarr and Alphonse Areola somehow keeping out Mohamed Salah's close-range strike at the London Stadium before Christmas.",
      "However, the nod goes to the aforementioned Raya, who helped Arsenal inflict on Aston Villa their only home loss in the league this season with a simply ridiculous second-half stop to keep out Ollie Watkins' header.",
      "The Arsenal No 1 first had to touch Amadou Onana's deflected shot on to the bar, before immediately springing back up to his feet and pushing away to safety the England striker's point-blank header, with Gary Neville exclaiming on commentary: \"How Raya reacts, wow!\"Rich Morgan",
      "A moment that will live forever in history. James Tarkowski crashing in a 98th-minute equaliser in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Forty-one wins apiece for Everton and Liverpool at the Grand Old Lady. Forever. Hit play on our video above and drink in those extraordinary scenes again...Peter Smith",
      "Too many to choose from. The Man Utd head coach has been relegation-level on the pitch, but Quadruple-winning in the press conference room.",
      "\"We're maybe the worst team in the history of Man Utd,\" wins it though. That came in January after a loss to Brighton. Nobody actually expected him to follow through with it though…Sam Blitz",
      "A season of profit has been secured for the fifth season running with the best bets advised in the column leading to +18.7. It's been a bumpy ride involving near misses and losing runs but the winners have flowed nicely. A spell of betting against Manchester City at short prices before it was trendy to do so made me look very clever indeed, correctly calling wins for Tottenham (0-4), Bournemouth (2-1) and Brighton (2-1) during City's mid-season wobble was a memorable spell.",
      "There have been longshot treble wins at 10/1 and 14/1 - a particular highlight was Joelinton's card for Newcastle at Aston Villa copping the treble after Brentford beat Brighton and Palace and Bournemouth sailed under the 2.5 goals line in a 0-0 draw.",
      "And we've finished the season strongly, nailing a lovely 10/1 winning angle on 32+ fouls being committed in the Europa League final.Lewis Jones",
      "Learning to accept being wrong is a key part of keeping a sane headspace when it comes to making betting decisions and putting your neck on the line. And I've had plenty of practice this season.",
      "Let's start with Tottenham to finish in the top four and Dominic Solanke to score 20 or more goals shall we at 12/1? Or what about Leif Davis - the Ipswich assist-king of a full back - who I was excited about in the top assist markets in pre-season at 100/1? Just one assist was it Leif? Ah well.",
      "In fact, my reading for most of the season on the newly-promoted teams was downright ugly. Thinking Leicester were a \"barnstorming price\" to beat Everton at Goodison Park at 7/2 quickly went down the drain after just 10 seconds when Abdoulaye Doucoure sent the hosts on their way to the most comfortable 4-0 win you're ever likely to see.Lewis Jones"

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 06:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."
