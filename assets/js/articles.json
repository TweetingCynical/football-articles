      "Manchester United have moved to address their goalkeeper crisis on deadline day by signing Senne Lammens for £18.2million plus add-ons.",
      "United decided to recruit a new No.1 after mistakes from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana at the start of the season – and decided on Lammens.",
      "The 23-year-old Belgian travelled to Manchester on Monday to complete his move from Royal Antwerp and has signed a five-year deal with United.",
      "Lammens said: “I'm extremely proud to be joining Manchester United, it's a real dream come true. The past few years have been an amazing journey, it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special.",
      "“You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years. I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff.",
      "\"This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United also managed to offload three more members of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with Rasmus Hojlund joining Napoli on a season-long loan, Jadon Sancho moving to Aston Villa on loan and Antony making a permanent move to Real Betis.",
      "As part of their loan agreement for Hojlund, Serie A winners Napoli have an obligation to buy the Denmark striker - who cost United £72m two years ago - for £38m next summer if they qualify for the Champions League.",
      "The United hierarchy considered a move for Aston Villa's 32-year-old keeper Emiliano Martinez, but decided on Lammens because of his younger profile.",
      "Martinez would also have cost United twice as much as Lammens and would also have demanded wages in the region of £200,000-a-week.",
      "Against that backdrop, and with United needing to spend cautiously to comply with PSR rules having already spent more than £200m this this summer, Lammens was considered the best option.",
      "Another factor in United signing Lammens is understood to have been Sancho's unwillingness to join Villa on a permanent basis. United needed to get a fee for Sancho to cover Martinez's wages, but the winger would only go on loan, meaning United could only afford to move for Lammens.",
      "There is no sell-on clause in the deal agreed for Lammens, who United view as a goalkeeper who can grow into the role as first-choice and become a mainstay in the team for a number of years.",
      "\"I think it's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper at this moment,\" said Amorim, after Saturday's last-gasp 3-2 Premier League win over Burnley, with another erratic performance from Bayindir underlining the need to bring in a new No.1.",
      "With the arrival of Lammens, United now have four keepers on their books in Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "Sources close to Onana have said he intends to stay and fight for the No.1 spot, which makes it likely Bayindir will go out on loan for the rest of the season or seek a permanent switch.",
      "Lammens joined Antwerp on a free transfer from Club Brugge in 2023 and went on to make 64 appearances, winning the Belgian Super Cup in 2023.",
      "He has yet to earn a senior cap for Belgium, but received his first full international call-up back in March and is seen as the long-term successor to Thibaut Courtois.",
      "Lammens made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season, keeping seven clean sheets, and is considered one of the most exciting young keepers in Europe.",
      "But there will be no hiding place for him at United, where the focus and scrutiny is relentless, with his first game set to be the Manchester derby against City at the Etihad Stadium on September 14.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Erik ten Hag has angrily accused Bayer Leverkusen of never giving him the trust he deserved after the Bundesliga outfit made the decision to remove the former Manchester United manager from his post after just two league games.",
      "Ten Hag, 55, was selected by the former German champions as Xabi Alonso's successor after the popular coach decided to move onto pastures new with Real Madrid at the end of last season. But speculation over the Dutchman's future was rife at the weekend after Leverkusen conceded at the death to draw 3-3 with Werder Bremen.",
      "That result meant Leverkusen had just one point to show from Ten Hag's first two games in the Bundesliga. Confirmation that the club's top brass had opted to take nuclear action by relieving Ten Hag of his duties was confirmed on Monday.",
      "And shortly after the news had broken, Ten Hag took aim at his former employers for taking such an \"unprecedented\" decision in an explosive statement.",
      "“A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play,” he wrote. “I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret.",
      "“The decision by Bayer Leverkusen’s management this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a coach after just two league matches is unprecedented.",
      "“This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust. A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play. I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret.",
      "“I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust. Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success.",
      "“Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware. Finally, I would like to thank the Bayer Leverkusen supporters for their warmth and passion, and I wish the squad and staff every success for the remainder of the season.”",

      "Gary Neville was left at a loose end when he was told Manchester United wouldn't sign David Raya because he's \"not good enough with his feet.\" And that belief might have played a key role in taking United on their merry-go-round of goalkeepers in recent years.",
      "The Red Devils turned to Royal Antwerp stopper Senne Lammens on deadline day for an initial £18million. And Ruben Amorim will hope the 23-year-old Belgian can put an end to their woes between the posts after Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have continued the succession of calamitous keeping.",
      "It's become a prerequisite for many managers today that their goalkeepers come equipped with the ability to comfortably play the ball out from the back. And it seems United had that preference in mind when it came to supposedly snubbing Raya.",
      "\"I'd mentioned Raya to someone at United,\" said former England right-back Neville on The Overlap's Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"I'd watched him quite a bit for Brentford [and] thought he looked a good goalkeeper.",
      "\"And they said, 'Oh, he's not good enough with his feet.' The person I'd spoke to at United at the time...I remember thinking, 'I've watched Raya a lot. He's pretty good.' And you're thinking, 'He saves a lot of shots, quite good at dominating his box, he's quite brave.' And [Neville's contact] said, 'No, he's not good enough with his feet.'\"",
      "Some fans were left scratching their heads when Arsenal decided to sign Raya from Brentford in 2023, as Aaron Ramsdale didn't have too many detractors at the time. The Spaniard initially moved to the Emirates on loan, with the option to make the deal permanent for £27m, which Arsenal triggered 12 months later.",
      "Despite some early wobbles following his move to north London, Arsenal have been largely vindicated in their transfer decision. And many fans would likely agree Raya's ball-playing ability often looks like one of his strengths, never mind a weakness.",
      "\"It was the groundsman he [Neville] was talking to,\" joked fellow United legend Roy Keane as the Overlap crew burst out laughing.",
      "Arsenal icon Ian Wright also couldn't believe the criticism supposedly coming from someone in a place of privilege at Old Trafford.",
      "The anecdote serves to illustrate just how ill-advised some 'expert' minds can be, even at clubs with the profile and magnitude of United. But the Red Devils will hope to have finally cracked the code with up-and-coming Belgian talent Lammens.",
      "It's worth highlighting part of the reason David De Gea was moved on from the club was because some felt his feet and composure under pressure wasn't up to scratch. However, successors Onana and Bayindir have each displayed their own glaring weaknesses this season alone.",
      "Meanwhile, Raya was somewhat embarrassed after conceding a 35-yard free-kick to Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai on Sunday. And that was all the ammunition Neville needed to dub the Gunners the \"same old Arsenal\" after losing another crucial clash in the title race.",

      "The 21-year-old departed United over the weekend, his move to Stamford Bridge being confirmed, having spent the summer as part of the 'Bomb Squad' at Carrington - with fellow member Jadon Sancho heading to Aston Villa on deadline day. After his departure, Garnacho shared a heartfelt message on social media, expressing gratitude to United for helping develop his career.",
      "\"Dear Manchester. After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I'm very grateful for this.",
      "\"To the coaches, staff, and my teammates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had. I leave proud of what we achieved together and I'm also excited for what's to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was one of the first to reply, having not been allowed to leave United in recent days himself, despite Ruben Amorim's apparent disinterest in giving him regular minutes at the heart of midfield.",
      "\"All the best bro,\" penned the England midfielder. Ex-United defender, Sam Murray, who joined National League side Carlisle United earlier this year, commented: \"All the best hermano.\"",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Zirkzee, Rasmus Hojlund, Mainoo, Toby Collyer and Dan Gore were amongst the United stars who had 'liked' the message too.",

      "Mikel Arteta’s admission about Emiliano Martinez spoke volumes about the goalkeeper’s quality long before his Manchester United transfer fell through. The Aston Villa shot-stopper, 32, was linked with a deadline-day move to Old Trafford following error-filled performances of their existing options, Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "Martinez appeared to be gearing up for a move at the end of last season. He broke into tears while acknowledging the Villa fans following the last home game of the season against Tottenham. Despite links to the Saudi Pro League, he did not secure a transfer in the summer and played the full 90 minutes against Brentford last week.",
      "Martinez was then left out of the Villa squad on Sunday night as Unai Emery’s men fell to a 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace amid speculation that he wanted to join the Red Devils. However, it emerged on Monday that United had opted to sign Senne Lammens for £18.2million instead, thereby ending their pursuit of the Argentine international.",
      "It is understood that their decision to sign the relatively unknown Belgian, 23, on a five-year deal over the experienced Martinez was due to his younger profile. Martinez would also have cost United twice as much as Lammens and would have demanded wages in the region of £200,000-a-week.",
      "It marks a disappointing turn of events for Martinez, who is now well into his 30s and would have hoped to earn a move to a traditionally big club. Villa signed Martinez from Arsenal five years ago, and ever since, he has enjoyed a turn in fortune.",
      "Martinez had spent a decade at Arsenal, undertaking six loan spells elsewhere, before finally being handed a sustained run in the first team last season following an injury to regular first-choice goalkeeper Bernd Leno.",
      "Though the Argentine impressed in the top flight and was a key member of the side that won a record-extending 14th FA Cup title at Wembley, he was allowed to leave for Villa in a £17m deal in September 2020, with Arteta keeping Leno as his No. 1 option between the sticks.",
      "But Arteta later made the surprising admission that he had, in fact, wanted to keep Martinez, only selling him for financial reasons and the goalkeeper’s desire to be guaranteed game time, not having to compete for the No. 1 shirt.",
      "Arteta said ahead of a November 2020 fixture between Arsenal and Villa, which marked a reunion with his former player: \"He had a career of 10 years here. It wasn't just the last six or eight months. You have to look at everything he did through his time at the club.",
      "\"Obviously, it wasn't in my plans to sell him, but we gave him the chance because he deserved it. He performed really really well but we have to balance the books. We have to make the right choices in the market and obviously, I couldn't guarantee him to be the number one.",
      "\"He's a very ambitious person, he has been working really hard and he can see now that the opportunity is there. He's got the opportunity to play with Argentina and when a player asks you to do that I think you have to be open enough and tell him what you think about him.",
      "“If he makes the decision to leave, you should try to support him because he deserves it for the way he has served the club over the years.”",
      "Arteta’s words showed how highly he rated Martinez, who, aside from last season’s Champions League run with Villa, has not enjoyed a huge amount of success at club level despite his reputation as one of the world’s best goalkeepers.",
      "That’s in contrast to his international career with Argentina, where he is regarded as a legend after playing pivotal roles in two Copa America wins and one World Cup triumph. He made an extraordinary save in the World Cup final to deny France a victory in the final seconds, while his penalty shootout heroics have saved his nation on a number of occasions.",
      "Those feats have earned him worldwide acclaim, such as winning the prestigious Yashin Trophy two years in a row and being named on the list of Ballon d’Or nominees. With his future at Villa Park still unclear, Martinez will wonder if he will ever get the chance to compete for the Premier League and the Champions League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer have slammed Ruben Amorim's decision to turn away during Manchester United penalties. The Red Devils crashed out of the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town following a tense shootout.",
      "Meanwhile, Bruno Fernandes saved the game against Burnley, sealing a 3-2 win in United's favour thanks to a coolly converted spot kick. Amorim faced fierce criticism after his team's shock cup elimination, with the boss's choice to avoid watching United's penalties only intensifying the backlash.",
      "The United manager witnessed his team throw away the lead twice against Burnley at the weekend before Fernandes delivered in the 97th minute. Yet Amorim's touchline conduct has drawn condemnation from Lineker and Shearer after he similarly turned away from the decisive goal at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Lineker said: \"I don't think I've been particularly critical of Amorim because I think it's a difficult job. I think the club's in a bit of a pickle and it generally filters down from the top, as we've said many times, and I think he's probably a very good coach.",
      "\"He's probably come into a situation which he didn't realise before he took the job. But, I have to say this, if you're the manager or coach of a side and you hide in the dugout and not be prepared to watch your own players, some of them very young players, take penalties. I honestly... I mean, come on.",
      "\"This is the second or third round of the Carabao Cup for crying out loud! Do me a favour. That's not leadership. Leadership is, you've got to stand up and be there for your players. I think that's really important.\"",
      "Co-host Shearer agreed with Lineker's sentiments as the Premier League icon said: \"I thought that was a terrible look, him cowering away in the dugout, leaving some young players, some players that are making their first starts. Like everyone else, I thought it was an awful look for a manager to sit there hiding.\"",
      "Discussing United's recent triumph over Burnley, Shearer added: \"He did the same yesterday. He wasn't watching when Bruno was taking the penalty yesterday in the last minute. Slightly different, I guess.\"",
      "The victory against Burnley has seen United amass four points from their initial three league matches. On the transfer front, United are reportedly finalising a deal for goalkeeper Senne Lammens, amid the less-than-stellar beginnings for Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana this season.",
      "Nonetheless, Lineker couldn't shake off Amorim's approach to penalties in United's recent fixtures. The former Match of the Day host defended the manager when he faced ridicule for using a tactics board during the Grimsby match, yet he contends that Amorim is projecting the wrong image to his squad regarding penalties.",
      "He said: \"I had no issue with the tactics board thing because they all have certain ways of doing the tactics, some notes and stuff. That was fine. I just think not watching your team take penalties, even if it's a superstition... I mean, no. I'm sorry.\"",
      "Lineker also expressed his bafflement at former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's habit of looking away during penalty shootouts, explaining: \"I know Klopp sometimes didn't watch penalties but I don't get it. I'll say the same about Klopp.",
      "\"I never really understood that because, well, it ain't going to change it for a start. Also you need to see what your players are doing. It's something that I can't quite get my head around.\"",
      "As the Premier League gears up to return following the international break, Amorim's squad is set to face Manchester City on Sunday 14 September. Pep Guardiola's side is coming off back-to-back league defeats against Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton and Hove Albion, following an emphatic victory over Wolves in their season opener.",

      "Kolo Muani was a big hit at Frankfurt, eventually convincing PSG to spend a mammoth £76million to secure his services several years ago. The Frenchman has struggled to deliver and is poised to enjoy another loan move, this time in north London with Thomas Frank.",
      "The forward previously had a stint at Juventus and is not currently part of the plan in Paris with Tottenham looking to take advantage as a result. Kolo Muani, at his best, has proven to be an elite performer and the Premier League outfit will hope to get him back to his previous level.",
      "There is no obligation for Tottenham to buy the 26-year-old, who scored 10 times during his stint in Italy last term. The Athletic reports that personal terms have been agreed and Kolo Muani is heading to London for a medical.",
      "United were tracking the Frenchman backed when Erik ten Hag was in the midst of his second summer of recruitment. The Dutch manager had won a trophy and got into the top four and optimism was growing as the Manchester outfit sought more firepower.",
      "Ten Hag considered making a move for Kolo Muani, but later decided the better option was to invest in Rasmus Hojlund. The young Dane had impressed at Atalanta and £72m was spent to secure his signature despite him being far from the finished article.",
      "It is a gamble that has not paid off and Hojlund has struggled to deliver and towards the end of last season looked hugely bereft of confidence. He only managed to score four leagues goals in 2024/25 and is now pushing to complete a loan move to Napoli.",
      "The loan agreement may reportedly include a clause that would allow the Italian champions to sign Hojlund permanently for £38m if certain conditions are met - one being Champions League qualification. That could still represent a loss of more than £30m.",
      "It is another example of those at Old Trafford making poor decisions in the transfer market and later paying for it financially. Antony is set to leave for Real Betis for around a quarter of what United paid for him only three years ago. Jadon Sancho too could represent a huge loss if he does leave.",

      "His subsequent loan move to Chelsea the following year proved even more disappointing for the forward, scoring only once in 12 competitive matches for the Blues before returning to Ligue 1. While many supporters won't recall Falcao with the same affection reserved for legends like Ruud van Nistelrooy or Wayne Rooney, it's evident that fellow players hold an admiration for his achievements on the field.",

      "The Red Devils endured a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last term, with Amorim being conservative with his expenditure in the January transfer window, while reshaping the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag. However, the 40-year-old has certainly compensated for missed opportunities this summer, splashing out over £200million on a fresh attacking trio of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, with expectations of enhanced displays for his first full season on the sidelines.",
      "Following Mbeumo's arrival on the right flank, Amorim has opted to position Amad as a wing-back, despite the youngster's obvious talents lying in his offensive capabilities rather than defensive duties. And it's a decision that has left Mowbray perplexed.",
      "Speaking on No Tippy Tappy Football, the 61-year-old said: \"In my opinion, and can I say this from a position of total humility that he's manager of Manchester United, who am I? Who am I to tell him what to do? But in my stomach, it feels like you don't have to play 5-4-1, whatever you want to call it.",
      "\"You don't have to do it. If the group of players is screaming at you to play a three-man midfield to protect the mobility of a Casemiro if you want to play him or whoever it might be. You maybe have to put an extra man in there, so why would you be so stuck on one system and trying to force Amad as a right wing-back?",
      "\"Amad who's a brilliant footballer, Man United class I would suggest. I speak to Gary Pallister a lot about this when we sit and have coffee near my street most days. Amad, he's a genius.",
      "\"I talked about not having to look at the ball, the ball's stuck to his left foot. He is a brilliant football player, and a brilliant human being. And you're playing him at right wing-back just to fit into your system.\"",
      "\"He should be bending it in the top corner with his left foot, he should be sitting people on their backside and scoring wonderful goals like I know he can. Why's he chasing people into his own box playing right wing-back?\"",
      "A fan favourite on both flanks, Amad was the starting right wing-back for Manchester United in their draw against Fulham and win over Burnley, causing quite a stir among football enthusiasts globally. However, with Mbeumo's versatility as either a winger or a centre forward, the 23-year-old might struggle to secure playing time in his favoured position this season.",

      "Manchester United moved to address their goalkeeper crisis on deadline day by agreeing to sign Senne Lammens for £18.2million plus add-ons. United decided to recruit a new No.1 after costly mistakes from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana at the start of the season - with Lammens the preferred choice.",
      "The 23-year-old Belgium youth international travelled to Manchester to complete his move from Royal Antwerp and has agreed a five-year deal with United. United also considered a move for Aston Villa's 32-year-old keeper, Emiliano Martinez, but decided on Lammens because of his younger profile.",
      "Martinez would also have cost United twice as much as Lammens and would have demanded wages in the region of £200,000-a-week. Against that backdrop, and with United needing to spend cautiously to comply with PSR rules having already spent more than £200m this this summer, Lammens was considered the best option.",
      "There is no sell-on clause in the deal agreed for Lammens, who United view as a goalkeeper who can grow into the role as first-choice and become a mainstay in the team for a number of years. Lammens is set to make his United debut in the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium a week on Sunday.",
      "With the arrival of Lammens, United have four senior keepers on their books in Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton. Sources close to Onana have said he intends to stay and fight for the No.1 spot which makes it likely Bayindir will go out on loan for the rest of the season or seek a permanent switch.",
      "The Turkish shot-stopper started all three of United's league matches before the international break while Onana was given the Carabao Cup game at Grimsby. Bayindir's errors at home to Arsenal and Burnley either side of his struggles away to Fulham failed to convince Ruben Amorim that he was good enough to remain No.1 beyond the transfer window.",
      "Meanwhile, Onana had a nightmare against Grimsby Town. The Cameroonian was at fault for the League Two side's second goal and was weak in the penalty shootout.",
      "After Saturday's 3-2 victory over Burnley, United's first win of the season, Amorim launched a passionate defence of his goalkeepers, despite privately seeking a new one. \"Guys, they are humans,\" the Red Devils boss said.",
      "\"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",

      "The 55-year-old was given the boot by United just a few months after winning the FA Cup and guiding the team to eighth in the league. And given successor Ruben Amorim's struggles for consistency since replacing him last year, there are those who may even wish Ten Hag kept his place.",
      "Some may have felt those same pangs of regret after reading Ten Hag's address to the fans following his dismissal. The former Ajax and Utrecht chief penned an open letter to United's supporters soon after he was sacked, detailing just what it meant to represent the Red Devils during his two-year tenure.",
      "\"Dear fans, let me start by thanking you,\" started the message, which was published by his representatives, SEG. \"Thank you for always being there for the club. Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable. The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you.\"",
      "Ten Hag went on to celebrate the fans for their constant support and \"taking over opponents' stadiums (sic).\" And he also cherished the \"sense of unity\" he felt from Red Devils supporters no matter where he is in the world, whether that be in England or overseas.",
      "\"That's what makes United supporters so special,\" he continued, showing his classy character. \"I want to thank you for giving me this feeling and for your support. I also want to thank the staff in every department of the club for their unwavering support in good times and bad.",
      "\"We won two trophies – achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end.",
      "\"I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life. Erik.\"",
      "Ten Hag is the third former United manager to have faced the sack in less than a week. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was recently fired by Besiktas, while Fenerbahce axed Jose Mourinho several days ago.",
      "The former has yet to release a similar statement regarding his dismissal from the BayArena. Leverkusen managing director Simon Rolfes said \"nobody wanted to take this step\" but that persevering with the current setup was unfeasible.",
      "\"A parting of ways at this early stage of the season is painful, but we felt it was necessary,\" added Leverkusen chief executive Fernando Carro. \"We remain committed to achieving our goals for the season – and to do that, we need the best possible conditions at all levels and across the entire first team. Now it’s a matter of fully implementing and utilising these conditions again.\"",

      "David de Gea has questioned whether the transfer window should close before the season starts or whether the madness in the early weeks of the season should continue.",
      "We're three games into the Premier League season and Monday marks the final day of the transfer window. On one hand it presents clubs with an opportunity to plug gaps that may have emerged in the early weeks of the season, but it also means managers are having to deal with questions over their players.",
      "A number of major names have been the subject of speculation, which has been a distraction. On Sunday night ahead of Crystal Palace's win at Aston Villa both Marc Guehi and Emi Martinez were the talk of the town as they're linked with late moves.",
      "And the ex-Manchester United goalkeeper, who previously pushed for a move at the eleventh hour to Real Madrid, has said on social media: \"Question - Should the transfer window close before our season starts? Or should it continue the way it’s operating?\"",
      "Premier League clubs previously voted in favour of closing the transfer window before the start of the domestic season in 2017 - and it came into affect ahead of the 2018/19 campaign. However it quickly backfired as the major European leagues chose to stick with the status quo and that allowed them to go after Premier League players - with clubs then unable to sign replacements.",
      "Jurgen Klopp was among those to bemoan the situation as he said: \"I don't care when it closes, I only think it must close at the same time (as the rest of Europe). When they spoke about 'Let's finish it before the season starts then everyone knows their squad' - that's a good idea. But then the rest didn't do it and that makes no sense.",
      "\"Can somebody explain what is the benefit for the Premier League? We don't really have a problem but for other teams, their key players are still on the market and everything can happen. You want a team not only together but together and focused on the future, but that is not possible as long as there is a door open.\"",
      "If De Gea's suggestion was bought back in then a number of clubs, including his former one, would've been left carrying a number of players who do not want to be at the club. Antony's exit is close whilst Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia could still secure moves away from Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim is also looking to land a new goalkeeper, likely to be Senne Lammens.",
      "A number of other big names have haggled for moves, none more so than Alexander Isak. Had the transfer window shut just over a fortnight ago then Alexander Isak would've had to accept his fate of staying at Newcastle. Instead he's due to move to Liverpool in a club-record deal.",
      "An early close to the transfer window would encourage clubs to get their business done early - and end the franticness of deadline day. However the issue of failing to align with Europe would remain, unless all leagues agreed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jadon Sancho will love what Marcus Rashford previously said about his own loan spell at Aston Villa, as the Manchester United winger gets set to head there himself. Sancho is now poised to join Villa on a season-long loan, after the out-of-favour star was placed in Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' during pre-season, alongside Tyrell Malacia, Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "For now, Malacia is the only one left at Old Trafford; with Rashford on loan to Barcelona, Garnacho sealing a £40million switch to Chelsea last week, and Sancho on his way to Villa on deadline day.",
      "The 25-year-old will likely call upon his old United and England team-mate for advice about working under Unai Emery. Rashford spent the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan to Villa, and made a real stamp on the team during his limited time.",
      "Upon joining, Rashford admitted how he had \"a few clubs\" approach him, but choosing Villa was \"an easy decision\".",
      "He added: \"I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions. I just want to play football and am excited to get started.\"",
      "The Manchester-born star shone in the Champions League for Villa, while scoring four times across all competitions and making a big difference in Emery's front line.",
      "However, injury eventually hampered his time in the west Midlands and he returned to United for a brief period in the summer, before heading overseas to join Barcelona. When saying his goodbyes to the Villa supporters, Rashford's words could be of some comfort to Sancho as he heads to Birmingham for the season.",
      "Writing on social media at the time, Rashford said: \"Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me. It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from 1st minute on the pitch.",
      "\"Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",
      "Rashford also initially saw his fitness and goalscoring prowess improve while at Villa, as he commented on his confidence returning following the team's 3-0 victory over Preston North End that sent them to the FA Cup semi-finals.",
      "After scoring a brace in that game, the 27-year-old said: \"It's a great feeling, I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. It's obviously nice for a forward to get a goal so hopefully it continues.",
      "\"I think we have to just take it one game at a time and give it 100 percent on the pitch and see where it takes us. We're a very ambitious team – we want to win and try and get as far as we can in all competitions and we also want to push to get back into the top four.\"",
      "Sancho will benefit from hearing Rashford's words ahead of his straight loan move to United's Premier League rivals, given that he struggled for form before Amorim even arrived.",
      "In his 83 appearances for the club since he joined, the winger has scored 12 goals and assisted six times, with his most recent stint in red coming in a penalty shootout defeat to Manchester City in the Community Shield, where he played seven minutes and missed his spot-kick.",
      "Meanwhile, Emi Martinez has been looking at going the other way from Villa to United. But the Red Devils have now reportedly agreed a deal for Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens, which may well push Martinez out of Amorim's plans for the upcoming season – but anything could happen on deadline day.",

      "To avoid a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss, United had to offload Antony for £32.8m, but Betis have found it difficult to secure a permanent deal for the forward over the summer. After a successful loan spell at the Spanish club last season, Antony was keen on a move to Betis.",

      "Alastair Campbell was in the Old Trafford directors' box on Saturday, so the Manchester United communications department had an expert to turn to for some spin on their transfer window.",
      "Four senior signings and four senior departures is a modest turnover for the worst United squad in 51 years, a reflection of the Ineos cabal's backing for head coach Ruben Amorim and the business they have hitherto overseen.",
      "United invested £225.32million to bring in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. The word from well-placed sources is United did what they set out to achieve.",
      "Almost every player who was realistically expected to leave has left. Jettisoning Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho protected the long-term harmony of the squad and its performance culture.",
      "United cut the cord with Antony and Rasmus Hojlund, two headline signings of the Erik ten Hag era, in further shows of support for Amorim.",
      "Tyrell Malacia has proven to be unsellable, never mind a tough sell. Like one of their custodians, United were caught short on the goalkeeper front. They now have more goalies than out-and-out central midfielders.",
      "United are comfortable with their midfield roster. The quintet of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount have been billed as \"versatile\" by sources. Only three are specialists.",
      "With the deadline three days away, director of recruitment Christopher Vivell was on the phone at the club's Carrington training complex and could be heard acknowledging that a planned move was viewed as a \"step down\" by an unnamed player. Jadon Sancho held out long enough to secure an unforeseeable move to a Premier League club.",
      "United intended to come out of the blocks, as a senior source put it, with two early deals in the window: Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap. Delap's decision to join Chelsea over United for £30million meant the club ended up paying more than double that for their new No.9, Benjamin Sesko. He is yet to start a Premier League game.",
      "Sesko was a fourth-choice target - at best - and his performances have been as unconvincing as Amorim's handling of the 22-year-old. Wilcox was quoted in the statement confirming Sesko's signing but Vivell is more closely attached to the Slovenian. The pair were photographed in a celebratory clinch when Sesko signed for RB Leipzig in 2022.",
      "United conducted a data-led review of their 2024-25 season to determine which area required the most attention and concluded that a lack of goals was the biggest contributing factor to their worst season since relegation in 1974. Basic maths could have concluded that, never mind a bespoke algorithm.",
      "Members of the bomb squad sought shelter in temporary accommodation. Antony relocated to the Marriott hotel in Hale Barns, so close to Manchester Airport that the take-offs may have interrupted his sleep. Sancho was in and out of his mansion in the same suburb. Garnacho switched to a flat in Hale but was still paying the rent on his mansion that his parents and brother moved out of last season.",
      "United did their utmost to put a positive spin on the £40m sale of Garnacho. He had angled to leave in public and the fee is the fourth-highest for a departure in the club's history. Even former academy staff toasted the money United had recouped for him.",
      "Yet United banked only £2.5m more than Ipswich Town did from Nottingham Forest for Omari Hutchinson. Garnacho is a United academy graduate, Premier League-proven winger and Argentina international. Chelsea have got him on the cheap.",
      "United sources claimed Chelsea's opening offer was £25m. Both sides have dabbled in mischief-making against each other over the summer, whether it be Chelsea linking United with their dead wood strikers or United adding Chelsea to the clubs that Bryan Mbeumo rejected. Chelsea denied that they moved for Mbeumo.",
      "Garnacho and his on-off partner, Eva Garcia, visited London almost weekly last season. Sources say they would not be surprised if Ms Garcia returns to England now that the father of her child has moved to the capital. United staff on the post-season tour knew there was no chance of a U-turn from Amorim on Garnacho amid the winger's surly behaviour in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.",
      "Agency sources said early in the summer that Amorim's 'bomb squad' strategy would cost United millions. Chelsea and Real Betis were the only bidders at the table for Garnacho and Antony, which drove their prices down.",
      "Antony is a huge loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. United insiders say the club have nevertheless - maintained financial discipline in compliance with PSR.",
      "It remains to be seen if director of football Jason Wilcox will now emerge from the shadows. Dan Ashworth reflected on United's summer transfer window two days after it closed last year in the Old Trafford boardroom with journalists.",
      "One fan who encountered Wilcox enthusiastically lobbied him to get the Sesko deal done. Wilcox cagily stressed that Newcastle were also interested. The fan reminded him, \"It's Newcastle.\"",
      "Senior figures at United repeatedly stressed a goalkeeper was not a priority but Amorim's assessment of that area evolved as Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir took turns to drop clangers. Amorim endorsed an enquiry for Emiliano Martinez but Lammens is more aligned with the data-driven model United are implementing.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was the first of that ilk. He has been overpromoted and overplayed to the point that Amorim resorted to starting Diogo Dalot on the left wing against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "United noted that Lammens had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe, made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe’s top ten leagues and made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23. That will all be irrelevant when he is in net for the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "United supporters of a certain vintage will recall that Royal Antwerp were the club's original feeder club in the Nineties. United farmed out 34 players to the Belgian side and never signed anyone from them. Lammens is the first.",
      "Sources say a goalkeeper was a secondary priority contingent on whether Lammens would become available. Funds had to be raised from sales and loans for United to have the headroom to execute the £18.2m deal.",
      "Lammens and Sesko are contradictions. Amorim all but admitted that United prioritised established Premier League recruits yet the two most important positions in the team - in goal and up front - have been taken up by Premier League novices.",
      "\"You watch every weekend Matheus doing things against the players that you are going to face,\" Amorim said in Chicago on July 25. \"That can help you to have more certainty when you choose players. So that was a policy that we tried to use this season.",
      "\"So I can say yes, it's not just that, because they have characteristics that we need, but we focus on getting players that can come here and to face this kind of pressure, like you said, since the first day.\" Club sources clarified there was a balance of recruits to immediately improve the team and younger players with potential.",
      "United will leave it to Amorim to clarify whether Lammens, not among the four goalkeepers in the Belgium squad this month, is their new No.1. Elsewhere in goal, there is no movement on any outgoings (at the time of writing). United have four senior 'keepers in a season where they could play as few as 40 games if they exit the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "The Turkish transfer window is open until September 12 but Jose Mourinho had no interest in Onana or Bayindir before his defenestration at Fenerbahce. The Süper Lig runners-up bought Mourinho's old scourge, Ederson, who tossed milk at the Portuguese after Manchester City won at Old Trafford in December 2017.",
      "A dressing room source said Amorim was wary that Bayindir's confidence could be \"killed\" if he was dropped after his costly 'keeping against Arsenal. By sticking by the Turk at Fulham, Onana's own self-esteem plummeted, though that does not excuse his chastening performance at Grimsby Town.",
      "Confidence in both goalkeepers has dwindled among the United players. \"Altay is a good 'keeper and has good skills,\" a source who works with the player said. \"But United is too demanding for him.\"",
      "United will go big for a midfielder next year as the area was not regarded as a priority in the recent window. They came up short with Carlos Baleba but have started the long game. Casemiro will not be at the club next season and his heir apparent, Manuel Ugarte, has been the poorest of the Ineos-era recruits.",
      "Ugarte played under Amorim for two years at Sporting Lisbon but has started this season where he ended last season: on the bench. The interest in Baleba would suggest some at United have already given up on him.",
      "No amount of spin can disguise that.",

      "Manchester United did not consider strengthening their midfield as a priority this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon were signed in the summer window, but United did not strengthen Ruben Amorim's midfield options.",
      "United sources have said the midfield was never a priority due to already having options that the club views as strong and versatile.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are the options in midfield for Amorim. Casemiro and Fernandes have started in all three Premier League games this season.",
      "United enquired about Carlos Baleba's availability and Brighton valued the midfielder at around £100million. However, United spent £215m on signings, making it difficult to finance a marquee midfield arrival.",
      "Toby Collyer was allowed to join West Brom on a season-long loan. Collyer was permanently promoted to the first-team last term, but was given the green light to leave for first team football.",
      "Mainoo asked to leave on loan in the final week of the summer window. United blocked his request and Amorim insisted in his pre-Burnley press conference that he wanted the youngster to say.",
      "Speaking after the Fulham draw, Amorim revealed Mainoo was battling Fernandes for a starting role.",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he’s going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he’s fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",

      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Ruben Amorim during his speech on the final day of last season.",
      "Manchester United finished 15th in the Premier League and needed to respond in the summer window. Many thought defeat in the Europa League final would damage the club's prospects in the market.",
      "Thankfully, the window did not unfold like that. Liverpool were the Premier League club to 'win' the summer with their impressive business, but United must be considered among the sides who have conducted fine deals after a productive three months in a difficult market to manoeuvre.",
      "United overhauled their attacking line after scoring a dismal 44 league goals last season, adding Premier League-proven players and a striker, and completed the signing of a goalkeeper.",
      "The only blemish was the failure to sign a new midfielder, which could be a major problem area.",
      "But it's worth focusing on the positives to begin with. Matheus Cunha was the first signing of the summer for £62.5milliion from Wolves, which was a straightforward deal to complete.",
      "United triggered Cunha's release clause at Molineux and personal terms were not a problem. It was the perfect start, but fans began to raise concerns during the pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Brentford are notoriously tricky to negotiate with and hung tough in discussions for Mbeumo. United entered talks by bidding £45m, with £10m in add-ons, and they finally walked away from the table with an agreement to sign Mbeumo for £65m, plus £6m in add-ons, over a month later.",
      "United are not the only club to be stung by the Bees' tough negotiating this summer, as Newcastle signed Yoane Wissa in a £55m deal on the final day of the window after a dogged pursuit of the forward.",
      "Mbeumo was signed in time to travel to the United States for the pre-season tour. He got off the mark against Grimsby and scored his first Premier League goal against Burnley.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo should be terrific additions. They have already demonstrated their quality in their short time at the club, and supporters are desperately hoping for a positive injury update on Cunha after the Brazilian was forced to be substituted with a muscle injury in the first half against Burnley.",
      "In comparison, Benjamin Sesko has looked rusty, although he does possess the potential to become one of the finest strikers in Europe. Ideally, United would have signed a frontman with experience, but they had to play the cards they were dealt and Sesko was attainable.",
      "United moved with impressive speed to wrap up a deal for Sesko, beating Newcastle to his signature. The Magpies are in the Champions League this season, but Sesko always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "The only slight negative with Sesko is that United needed a striker who could hit the ground running, someone who would make an immediate impact and score goals in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim has not started Sesko in the league since his arrival, preferring Mason Mount down the middle instead.",
      "Speaking after the win over Burnley, Amorim explained his decision not to bring the Slovenia international on earlier against Scott Parker's side.",
      "\"So he finished the [Grimsby] game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties,\" explained Amorim.",
      "\"And today was that reason also, because (Joshua) Zirkzee is also a striker, he's an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a division four team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.",
      "\"With the problem with Mason Mount (injury), I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes. So everything was connected. The penalty, the game on Wednesday, and the number of minutes that I was thinking to put Ben today.\"",
      "In the same press conference, Amorim defended his goalkeeper options, but it was crucial that United pushed in the final days of the transfer to strengthen that department.",
      "Altay Bayindir has made mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League this season. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby Town and made an error for their second goal.",
      "United sources consider Senne Lammens to be an exciting young goalkeeper with a bright future. The 23-year-old was called up to Belgium's senior squad in March and has a huge opportunity at United.",
      "It is hoped the £18.2m fee to sign Lammens from Royal Antwerp could prove to be a bargain in a few years. Diego Leon and Enzo Kana Biyik were also exciting young additions for the club's future.",
      "United explored signing a midfielder in the window. Brighton valued Carlos Baleba in excess of £100million and planned to keep him for another season, which killed the hope of adding him to the squad.",
      "The 21-year-old has developed a strong reputation in a short space of time at Brighton, but would Baleba have been an instant success? He is a young midfielder and Brighton's valuation was daunting.",
      "Nonetheless, it is disappointing that United ended the window without strengthening in the centre of the pitch. Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are poor options and Amorim felt he needed a fresh face.",
      "United will have to make do for the first six months of the season. Midfield could be a problem and United would have overseen a perfect transfer window if they had signed a top player in the ilk of Casemiro.",
      "Ineos chiefs will have to settle for 'an almost perfect' window instead. The members of the 'bomb squad' proved hard to shift, but United eventually got there in the end, with the exception of Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan and there is an option to make the move permanent for £26m. Barcelona are covering Rashford's wages, which is estimated to save United around £12m this season.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was sold to Chelsea for £40m. That felt like a low fee for a player whose value was much higher 12 months ago, but the wider context must be considered",
      "United received £19m, with a potential £2.6m in add-ons, for Antony, while Rasmus Hojlund joined Napoli on loan with a view to it becoming permanent for £38m next summer when certain obligations are met.",
      "Aston Villa will also cover at least 80 per cent of Jadon Sancho's wages during his loan.",

      "A new goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United this summer but head coach Ruben Amorim's outlook on the area has evolved amid the erratic form of Onana.",
      "Third-choice goalie Tom Heaton, 39, has not played since February 2023 and is unlikely to figure for United this season with the signing of Lammens and sparse schedule. United do not have a cup game now until the FA Cup third round in January and could play as few as 40 matches in 2025-26.",
      "The transfer window for the major European leagues closes on Monday but the Saudi Pro League transfer window closes on September 10.",
      "It remains to be seen whether United will receive an offer for Onana or Bayindir after Monday. Onana, 29, has been determined to stay at United but faces an uncertain future.",
      "Lammens, who received his first call-up to the Belgium squad in March, is not in their squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Kazakhstan. Onana and Bayindir were named in the Cameroon and Turkey squads.",

      "Emi Martinez believes that Manchester United have sold a \"little treasure\" in Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Aston Villa goalkeeper was omitted from Unai Emery's matchday squad on Sunday as they suffered a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. The boss confirmed he wasn't \"focused\" on the fixture amid speculation over a potential transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Whilst Ruben Amorim insists that he's content with his goalkeeping options of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, momentum is building around the World Cup winner making an eleventh-hour switch to Manchester.",
      "However, Martinez won't be thrilled that the Portuguese boss has parted ways with one of his international colleagues, following Garnacho's £40million switch to Chelsea. When the young winger earned his first Argentina cap in June 2023, the goalkeeper was full of praise for Garnacho's qualities both on and off the pitch.",
      "Chatting to TyC Sports at the time, he said: \"He is a very humble guy. He came to work; he didn't talk a lot.",
      "\"He is very eager to play. The truth is that he's a little treasure and I hope we can mould him so that he gives us as much as Angel Di Maria.\"",
      "Whilst Martinez might be saddened by Garnacho's departure from the club he could potentially join in the coming hours, he still has a recognisable face ahead of him in United's defence.",
      "During Argentina's memorable World Cup triumph in 2022, the heroic goalkeeper branded Lisandro Martinez an \"animal\", as the duo helped their nation claim their third golden trophy - and their first since 1986. The defender has been absent from the United squad with a cruciate knee ligament injury since last season, but is aiming for a comeback to action following the international break.",
      "Meanwhile, the Villa goalkeeper could provide the solution to Amorim's goalkeeping dilemma, as both current shot-stoppers have struggled to win over supporters and pundits since the campaign began.",
      "Onana has featured just once for the Red Devils this term, in the disappointing penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. Whilst the goalkeeper did stop one penalty, he was unable to prevent two goals from finding United's net during normal time, and has subsequently been benched in favour of Bayindir again.",
      "Bayindir has let in four goals across three matches, including a brace from newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. Speaking about the potential departure of his first-choice goalkeeper, Emery remained as evasive as possible as he simply mentioned Martinez's replacement, Marco Bizot, repeatedly to journalists.",
      "When pressed further regarding the 32-year-old's unavailability, he added: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent.",
      "\"He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\" Royal Antwerp keeper Senne Lammes has also been linked with a late deadline day move to United.",

      "Manchester United are pushing to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes for business on Monday at 7pm. Doubts over Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have led to Ruben Amorim exploring other options.",
      "Throughout the window, Emiliano Martinez and Senne Lammens have been linked with moves to Old Trafford. A loan offer for Martinez was understood to be rejected previously before their attention turned to Lammens.",
      "Now, with less than 48 hours of the window remaining, United's search for a new number one has taken a number of twists and turns. On Sunday morning, it was suggested that Martinez would be prioritised, with personal terms not believed to be an issue, before other outlets suggested Lammens is the number one target.",
      "Both players are understood to be open to joining the club before the window slams shut. But with contrasting reports, who will United go for? Our writers share their verdict on who they think should be prioritised.",
      "I actually don't think this is as close as it may seem. United need a goalkeeper who is one of the best, someone who is going to immediately replace Onana and Bayindir. Martinez is that.",
      "Everything that has been said around Lammens points towards him being a competitor for the number one spot. Martinez comes in ready to take the shirt immediately.",
      "The Villa goalkeeper is one of the best at shot-stopping and being a presence inside his box. Too many times has Ruben Amorim been let down by his goalkeeper, and it's a feeling that Unai Emery hasn't had many times with Martinez.",
      "His age is a slight concern, but there's nothing stopping him from being the new Edwin van der Sar and drastically improving the numbers.",
      "I think that United need to sign a proven Premier League goalkeeper before Monday's 7pm deadline. It's clear that Bayindir and Onana are both not good enough for the Reds, meaning Amorim's side have got to dip into the market for a new No.1.",
      "While there is no doubt that Senne Lammens is a talent and has a lot of potential, I think that Emiliano Martinez would be the most ideal candidate at this stage. With 197 Premier League appearances under his belt, Martinez has cemented himself as an elite top-flight shot-stopper.",
      "As well as this, Martinez is a World Cup winner and has won the Yashin Trophy in the past two years, and I think he is the right calibre of goalkeeper that United need to target. Even though Martinez is 33 on Tuesday, I still believe United should still sign him, as they need a new 'keeper NOW.",
      "United should prioritise neither Emiliano Martinez nor Senne Lammens and go for Gianluigi Donnarumma. The latter is just years older than Lammens, with the former six months his senior.",
      "Donnarumma seems destined for Manchester City, but it has appeared that way for weeks, and Ederson remains at the club with James Trafford still between the sticks. United appears a better stylistic fit for the Italy international; such are the demands of being Pep Guardiola's goalkeeper.",
      "Wages presumably would be an issue, as they likely are for Martinez, but being able to move on from Onana would offset some of that outlay. Donnarumma could be United's goalkeeper for the next decade, much like David de Gea once was, who also received significant remuneration from the club.",
      "In the long term, signing Martinez for a few seasons before requiring a replacement. Gambling on Lammens and potentially needing an alternative in two years could also become more expensive without even considering the on-pitch impact.",

      "Raheem Sterling traded one London club for another in a last-minute switch in 2024, paving the way for Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to make his escape to Chelsea.",
      "The previous year's deadline day was rife with Premier League surprises, with the Blues' dramatic transfer activity making plenty of headlines. Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal and United saw Sancho and Sterling relocate to different parts of London on loan for the new season.",
      "As the transfer window closed, the Blues issued a brief statement confirming Sterling's departure that read: \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger, who is now back at Stamford Bridge and has since turned 30, completed a last-minute loan move to the Emirates Stadium. This occurred after it became apparent that he was not in manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club over the summer.",
      "Chelsea welcomed another new face to their squad: former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially replaced Sterling. The England international had also been left out of then-manager Erik ten Hag's plans at United and was free to leave either on loan or permanently.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the young forward's preferred destination, with Chelsea agreeing to an obligatory purchase price of £23million if certain targets were achieved.",
      "This was a stark contrast to the hefty £73.5m that the club shelled out in the summer of 2021 to entice Sancho to Manchester.",
      "However, his performances at Old Trafford were underwhelming. He scored only 12 goals and provided six assists in 83 appearances, causing his value to plummet significantly.",
      "In the meantime, Sterling found himself back with an old acquaintance at Arsenal; manager Mikel Arteta, who had spent considerable time working under Pep Guardiola during Sterling's seven-year stint with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the conclusion of the 2024/25 season, regardless of his impact at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "During his spell at Arsenal, the forward scored just once and provided five assists in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League.",
      "Sterling was used sparingly but arguably had his best match when he assisted Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice in a 2-2 draw against PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's premier competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but he ultimately ended the season without any trophies and rarely played before returning to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Sancho had a standout year with Chelsea, netting five goals and providing 10 assists across 41 appearances in domestic and European competitions. The young winger's most notable performances came in the Premier League and the knockout stages of the Conference League.",
      "After reaching the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund during his loan spell in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho found himself in another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, where they triumphed over the Spanish side in a resounding 4-1 victory, with Sancho scoring the third goal in the 83rd minute.",
      "Despite his contributions to their trophy-winning campaign, Chelsea chose to pay a fee to United to avoid triggering Sancho's buyout clause, seemingly unconvinced by the winger's performances.",
      "Sancho now finds himself part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still attempting to facilitate a move for the winger who doesn't feature in the Portuguese manager's future plans.",
      "Sancho has already rejected offers from Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly on the radar of several clubs, while Sterling also finds himself surplus to requirements at Chelsea. With both players in precarious positions at their respective clubs, there's every possibility they could be involved in another dramatic deadline day move but will no doubt hope to make a greater impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",

      "Chido Obi recently removed Manchester United from his bio on Instagram.",
      "The removal of the club's name could be completely insignificant, but followers of the academy have suggested it could be a hint at frustration with a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "The best way to respond to that disappointment is to score for the academy and Obi notched his second goal of the campaign to open the scoring against Manchester City Under-21s.",
      "The Manchester clubs clashed at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday afternoon, which felt like the appetiser for the proper Manchester derby at the Etihad following the international break.",
      "Maybe Obi thought throughout the summer that he would have a chance of being involved in such occasions this season. The youngster made eight first-team appearances last term, he outshone Rasmus Hojlund during the post-season trip and travelled to the United States for pre-season.",
      "Obi started against Leeds in Stockholm and made a further two appearances from the bench in the USA, but Ruben Amorim has not named the young striker in any of his matchday squads this season.",
      "The 17-year-old must earn his stripes for first-team involvement. He made a strong impression last term in difficult circumstances, but it was obvious that he still had a long way to go with his development.",
      "Obi may look at Max Dowman (15) and Ethan Nwaneri (18) at his former club Arsenal and notice that Mikel Arteta has permanently promoted both of those players to his senior squad.",
      "Every situation is different, and Obi must knuckle down to impress Amorim with his performances for the U21s. He struggled to get involved for large parts of the first half against City in the mini-Manchester derby and received an earful from the newly appointed assistant manager, David Horseman.",
      "\"Go on Chido, inside shoulder,\" Horseman shouted at one stage to encourage Obi to press his opponent. Obi was drifting through the contest, but showed just before half-time why he is such a talent.",
      "Obi pounced on Divine Mukasa's indecision around the City penalty area. The youngster still had work to do, but impressively skipped into the box to finish brilliantly beyond City goalkeeper Jack Wint.",
      "Strikers who are worth their salt only need a single chance to finish and Obi has admirable instincts in the box. Some players must work tirelessly on their finish technique, but it comes naturally to Obi.",
      "United were fortunate to have a 1-0 advantage by the interval. City created excellent chances in the first 30 minutes, but couldn't find a breakthrough and their wastefulness was punished.",
      "\"Why did he shoot so early,\" City manager Ben Wilkinson vented on the touchline when Justin Oboavwoduo failed to keep his cool after a poor back pass from Jaydan Kamason.",
      "Wilkinson looked understandably disappointed as he returned to the dressing room for the break. City couldn't make their dominance count and the momentum shift continued when play resumed again.",
      "United were hugely improved at the beginning of the second half, seemingly energised following a discussion with Binnion. Sam Mather came close to scoring on the left and James Scanlon's shot flashed inches wide.",
      "Then Shea Lacey was introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald to make his first U21 appearance. The supremely talented youngster almost made an immediate impact with a volley from the edge of the box, but it was saved.",
      "City counter-attacked moments later to equalise through Reigan Heskey. Both sons of Emile Heskey started for City, while Darren Fletcher's twins started for United, which was a subplot to make fans feel old.",
      "Binnion reacted by introducing Amir Ibragimov. The youngster played a full 90 minutes for the Under-18s on Saturday and was not only fine to play again - but scored the match winner.",
      "Lacey played a wonderful cross into the box to find Ibragimov at the back post to wrap up an impressive Manchester derby victory. United fans will be hoping for the same result when the first-team play after the break.",

      "It emerged on Saturday that United were considering a late swoop for Martinez after Altay Bayindir made another mistake during their 3-2 win against Burnley. The Argentina international, who has received multiple offers, is reported to be waiting on a move to the Reds.",
      "Martinez is said to have agreed personal terms on a switch to United and he is keen to push through a deal before the end of the transfer window. The Reds are thought to be in active talks with Villa for Martinez.",
      "With the former Arsenal 'keeper wanting to leave Villa Park and join the Reds, Unai Emery has now made the decision to leave Martinez out the squad to take on Palace in the 7pm Sunday kick-off.",
      "Despite starting last weekend's defeat at Brentford, Martinez won't feature against Palace with Marco Bizot selected as the Villa goalkeeper. Bizot signed from Ligue 1 club Brest on a free transfer in the summer and kept a clean sheet against Newcastle United earlier this month, when Martinez was suspended.",
      "While United are in negotiations with Villa for Martinez, the Reds are also making progress on a deal for Senne Lammens. The 23-year-old has been left out of successive Royal Antwerp squads and discussions with United continue. Lammens has not agreed personal terms, but it's hoped a breakthrough can be reached.",
      "Amorim has watched Bayindir make mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby and made an error for their second goal.",
      "Speaking after the 3-2 win against Burnley, Amorim defended his 'keepers, insisting it's hard to be a goalkeeper in this current United side. \"Guys, they are humans,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better.

      "It's deadline day and Manchester United are expecting a busy final day in the transfer window. Ruben Amorim's men got the majority of their business done earlier in the summer but there are still alarm bells ringing at Old Trafford.",
      "After three games, United have won one, drew one and lost one in the Premier League. Last week, they crashed out of the EFL Cup at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are showing glimpses of what they can do but Benjamin Sesko has struggled to make an impact. Now, with less than 24 hours of the window remaining, United are searching for a final addition.",
      "A new midfielder could still be added to Amorim's squad with Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller being linked with a move to the Premier League. According to journalist Sacha Tavolieri, Stuttgart chiefs are currently discussing whether or not to sell the player.",
      "Mason Mount's injury against Burnley and uncertainty over Kobbie Mainoo's future means a move for Stiller could be on the cards.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"After the first four games of the season, some would argue that a new midfielder is the priority for United over a goalkeeper. Casemiro has struggled and Bruno Fernandes is just better further forward.",
      "\"Stiller is a player who has been linked previously but leaving it until the last few days may be too late. It seems as though United are gunning for a new goalkeeper meaning signing the midfielder is unlikely.",
      "\"However, if they can get it over the line, they will be strengthening a key area with a transfer no-one saw coming.\"",
      "Jadon Sancho has been included in talks between United and Aston Villa for Martinez. According to The Athletic, the possibility of including the winger in a deal that would see him move to Villa Park has been mentioned.",
      "Martinez missed Villa's 3-0 loss to Crystal Palace on Sunday night amid interest from United. The report states that talks are ongoing between the two clubs, as are discussions with Antwerp for Lammens.",
      "Sancho is expected to depart United today with a number of clubs keen.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Much has been made of United's need to sign a goalkeeper and midfielder before the window closes. But perhaps one of their most important pieces of business today is shifting players who do not have a future at the club.",
      "\"Sancho falls into that bracket alongside Antony and Tyrell Malacia. The worrying thing is that none of them are on the brink of joining new clubs. If United can sign Martinez and sell Sancho in the same deal, they will be delighted.\"",

      "When you’ve already placed yourself so firmly hostage to fortune by announcing the transfer window winners, it’s only right and proper to repeat that by pointing and laughing at the ‘losers’ before they go on and enjoy enormously successful seasons at the far more trivial business of actual football.",
      "You can read all about the winners here if you’re interested in that sort of thing and the full exhaustive club-by-club list of Premier League transfers this summer is here too.",
      "If, like us, you’re far more in your element foretelling misery and despair than happiness and rainbows, then you’re in the right place…",
      "The problem for any club that gatecrashes the elite is that the efforts of a few years can all so quickly fall apart in a few weeks of poor decisions and mild panic.",
      "Even when that club is one of the size of Aston Villa. The last few years under Unai Emery have produced rapid and exciting progress, but also delivered that progress in a way that – on the field at least – has felt incredibly and now worryingly perhaps deceptively sustainable.",
      "Good players working hard for an excellent manager with a clear plan shouldn’t be revelatory but it has been for Villa.",
      "Until now. This feels like a summer that has seen the sands shift beneath Villa’s feet. Even those members of the old Big Six who’ve had questionable summers have had demonstrably better ones than Villa, whose deadline day panic buying spree is all the worse in many ways for feeling so much like a planned deadline day panic buying spree.",
      "They simply had no choice but to wait and see what was left on the shelf when everyone else had finished.",
      "It was, inevitably, a mixed bag. We’re genuinely interested to see just what Harvey Elliott can achieve now he’s got the chance to play club football with the kind of responsibility that brought the best out of him for England’s Under-21 side but we’re no longer remotely as sure as we would have been a year – or even six months ago – that Villa represent the right environment for that to happen.",
      "What little else they’ve managed to achieve is either underwhelming at best or just so absurdly on brand it feels like a joke. If you’re a club with an infamously unsustainable wage bill you simply cannot go around on deadline day signing Jadon Sancho on loan and expect to be taken seriously.",
      "And on top of the uninspiring ins comes the failure to get Emi Martinez out the door. A club in Villa’s financial position simply cannot afford to have a player like that hanging around on the outside p*ssing into the tent before we even consider the potential impact on such vagaries as team spirit and morale.",
      "Not for the first time a Premier League club finds itself in the position of hoping a Turkish team might come along and solve their problems.",
      "",
      "Villa’s d*ckhead is now just a d*ckhead.",
      "",
      "It’s not quite been as gloomy as it might have been on the incomings, in the end, and had Newcastle managed to get the £30m fee that was being thrown around as possible for William Osula on deadline day then it might even have been possible to argue Newcastle had actually ended up with an okay transfer window. As long as you kind of ignored the acrimony and order of how things all panned out.",
      "But really it’s been a summer that has served as a gloomy reminder for Newcastle that even Champions League football doesn’t give them enough pull to consistently beat even the smallest or stupidest members of the Big Six on transfer matters and that stings.",
      "Time and again this summer Newcastle have been beaten to key targets by clubs they consider direct rivals, while another was able to eventually bully them into selling their prized asset, one they had spent all summer briefing to anyone who’d listen would not be sold.",
      "Newcastle fans are entitled to feel hurt at the way Alexander Isak went about getting his move, but no more so than Brentford fans are about the way Yoane Wissa went about getting his.",
      "And there will be less sympathy from the wider football community for the real reason this summer of regression feels so pointedly painful at Newcastle; that they believed so certainly when selling the very soul of the club to Saudi Arabia they were leaving all this kind of frustration behind.",
      "",
      "Spent the first half of the summer signing a load of big lads for the defence and midfield and that’s fine, but then spent the second half of the summer very much not signing any of the attacking players Leeds so desperately need.",
      "We like Dominic Calvert-Lewin a great deal, but if you’re a Premier League club signing him to solve your dismal lack of goalpower in big 2025 then you are profoundly unserious.",
      "Daniel Farke and his squad and the fans have been let down by owners who promised the earth and have failed to deliver the surely attainable tools that Leeds needed to launch a viable survival bid in a Premier League that suddenly looks distinctly survivable.",
      "Leeds have already shown plenty in the win over Everton and goalless draw with Newcastle that they can go toe-to-toe with established Premier League sides – even if the hammering at Arsenal shows they’re way short against the very best. But they have also scored one goal – a penalty – in three games and barely looked like scoring at all in those last two.",
      "Leeds are not your regular promoted club and while nobody expects them to be competing for top talent with the Big Six/Seven/Eight the fact the’ve entered September appearing to have been outmanoeuvred by the other promoted clubs feels like an enormously avoidable error.",
      "The late collapse of an attempted deal for Harry Wilson is unfortunate, but also precisely the kind of misfortune you risk falling victim to when you leave something that has been in obvious need of attention all summer until the very last minute.",
      "",
      "Just not in any way the summer Palace would have planned and hoped for when lifting the FA Cup at the start of it.",
      "A Europa League place became a Europa Conference League place with an underwhelming slate of incomings coming nowhere near covering for the predictable, understandable and long-feared departure of Eberechi Eze for Arsenal.",
      "Palace were at least able to pull the plug on Marc Guehi’s move to Liverpool when their own hunt for a replacement turned up nothing suitable after a move for Igor collapsed. And there’s little doubt that Palace are stronger with Guehi than they would have been with Igor or anyone else they’d managed to land at such short notice.",
      "Guehi has also been a complete pro throughout a protracted transfer saga, playing a full – and spectacular goalscoring – part for Palace throughout. There will be disappointment there for sure, but no need for awkward and potentially destabilising reintegration of a player who had shown his hand.",
      "But when the big positive of your transfer window is that you’ve had to deny one of your best players a move they clearly wanted because everything else fell through at your end, then you’ve not come out of it looking great.",
      "The biggest fear for Palace now may be what happens if and when (far more likely the latter) some bigger club or other comes sniffing around the elite manager who has taken Palace further than any manager before yet not been given anything like the help he needs to go further still.",
      "",
      "Absolutely shouldn’t feel too gloomy when the initial pangs of regret fade. He’s still in the final year of his contract, he will have far greater control over his future in January and then total control of it next summer.",
      "He has burned no bridges at Selhurst Park and is still odds-on to end the season as England’s starting centre-back. There are worse ways that things can go wrong.",
      "Still, though. It’s just got to sting, hasn’t it? To have a move to the reigning champions and favourites to win it again this season agreed to the point of passing a medical only for it all to be snatched away at the last moment?",
      "",
      "Let’s start with the positives. Getting Caoimhin Kelleher was smart business, wasn’t it? The best number two in the Premier League now gets the chance to establish himself as a number one. He’s likely to be busy.",
      "Beyond that, though, this must go down as one of the most brutal ‘know your place’ summers any member of the ‘Other 14’ has suffered. Losing Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, two players who truly did light up last season, is horrible even without coming on the back of losing the inspirational manager who might just have been the one man making all of what’s happened to Brentford in recent years possible anyway.",
      "It’s the combination that makes you fear so keenly for Brentford. To have the guts of the team ripped out might have been survivable had Thomas Frank still been the manager. But he isn’t, and it really might not be something Brentford can get through with a rookie manager trying to navigate a situation that would test a seasoned firefighter to the very limits.",
      "",
      "We’re already seeing the difference it can make if your team gets picked off by the bigger boys but the manager remains with the example of Bournemouth.",
      "It is frankly absurd that you can lose almost your entire (excellent) defence at a club like Bournemouth and then produce the sort of performance the Cherries turned in at Tottenham at the weekend, when the hosts had simply no answer and created literally nothing against a team that could easily be forgiven for still licking their many wounds.",
      "Andoni Iraola is probably a genius. That’s the good news for Bournemouth. The bad news is that after the loss of Milos Kerkez and Ilya Zabarnyi and Dean Huijsen he pretty much has to be.",
      "",
      "Really is mad to think of the giddy optimism of that springtime run of six straight wins that lifted Wolves once and for all out of relegation bother. It’s only five months ago, but the mood now is wildly different.",
      "The loss of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester was always going to be tough to ride out, but there just hasn’t been anything like enough subsequent movement the other way to feel like Wolves have a chance.",
      "We’ve been here before. This is a club that is no stranger to disastrous starts and swift course corrections through the second half of the season.",
      "But this particular disastrous start is already feeling like something more for a club that has performed the troubling trick of emerging from the summer having spent more than they’ve recouped yet with a weaker team and squad to show for it.",
      "",
      "We really do struggle to think of another example of a side spending so much money and having so little to actually show for it. Spending over £70m on Jean-Clair Todibo and Mateus Fernandes is wild behaviour, and only in part countered by getting as much as they did for Mohammed Kudus, a man who had clearly grown disillusioned with life as a Hammer and didn’t really fit with Graham Potter’s plans anyway.",
      "Perhaps our favourite bit about  West Ham’s summer business, most of which looks so very, very daft on paper, is that in Callum Wilson and Kyle Walker-Peters they might just have picked up two of the canniest free transfers of anyone along the way.",
      "",
      "Oh, mate. Look, even Mediawatch at its cynical, snarky, sarcastic worst will always acknowledge that reporting transfer news is hard. Things change all the time. What’s correct one day can be completely and entirely wrong the next.",
      "It’s the nature of the beast. Absolutely nobody – at least nobody acting in any kind of good faith – expects any football journalist to have a 100 per cent accuracy rate on transfers. Nobody really cares or will remember the times you get it ‘wrong’.",
      "Unless, of course, you make the insistence that one particular transfer cannot possibly happen your entire personality, for an entire summer, and then when that transfer duly does happen write a long ‘I’m not owned’ post about how you were right actually and that spending your summer arguing about it in a weirdly confrontational manner with randoms on twitter rather than spending time with your family is something to be proud of.",
      "But beyond the silliness of it all, there is a serious point here. Edwards’ big error, apart from becoming just way more invested in a specific transfer saga than can ever be healthy for anyone, was in fundamentally misunderstanding the journalist’s role. He said ‘I only reported what I was told’ as a boast, when it is in fact a startling admission.",
      "When everyone else tells you it will almost certainly rain but Saudi Arabia tell you it definitely won’t, it’s your job to call everyone on Twitter carrying an umbrella a simpleton.",
      "",
      "Hard to shake the notion that both clubs would have been better off going for the other one.",

Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edged the champions closer to the £300m mark, while Isak took them past £400m."

      "All things being equal, Manchester United and Manchester City will both confirm the deadline-day signing of a new goalkeeper, but we wonder whether they should make minor deal sheet alterations to bring about a late swap.",
      "Senne Lammens will compete with Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir to be No.1 under Ruben Amorim, while James Trafford will currently be cursing his luck having started the first three games for City this season as Gianluigi Donnarumma arrives from Paris Saint-Germain. Neither makes a great deal of sense.",
      "In a summer in which logic doesn’t appear to have played too great a part in a significant number of transfers – particularly in a striker market in which demand has driven the price of those supplied up to a level in which William Osula costs £30m – it appears as though City have signed a goalkeeper incompatible with who they are, while United’s doesn’t fit with where they are.",
      "Donnarumma is arguably the best ‘proper goalkeeper’ in the world. PSG would not have won the Champions League without him and at just 26 years old, £30m is a snip, if indeed you want a goalkeeper of his type.",
      "There are few better shot-stoppers in world football. His size, reactions, speed and positioning means if you want a goalkeeper to stop the ball going in your net or one to dominate the penalty area, Donnarumma is your man.",
      "PSG boss Luis Enrique hailed him as “one of the very best goalkeepers out there and an even better man” in an attempt to sweeten the bitter pill of Lucas Chevalier being signed from Lille for £35m to replace him as the Ligue 1 giants’ No.1. Enrique wanted a ‘different profile’ of goalkeeper in Chevalier – who’s very good with his feet – in a move which feels very like what Pep Guardiola did eight years ago when he brought Ederson in to replace Joe Hart.",
      "Ederson – who’s now joining Fenerbahce to make room for Donnarumma – has spent the last eight years being the first line of City’s attack, and with Trafford presumably re-signed with a view to continuing with that ball-playing out-from-the-back style, a move for a goalkeeper snubbed by a manager with very similar values to Guardiola feels like a very odd move.",
      "There’s surely no world in which Donnarumma joins City and watches Trafford from the bench, and while Guardiola’s genius has been in adapting his style throughout his managerial career, we can’t see a move towards speculative goalkeeper punts forming a part of his latest revision, harsh on Donnarumma’s passing ability though that suggestion is.",
      "His flaws make him far better suited to Manchester United, not because Ruben Amorim doesn’t also value the ball-playing ability of his goalkeepers, but because of an Old Trafford tenure pockmarked by goalkeeping errors, specifically shots which should have been saved and crosses which should have been dealt with, along with a crying need for the Red Devils to go back to basics in all areas.",
      "What Amorim is getting in Lammens is further questions over his No.1. Donnarumma or even Emiliano Martinez would have stopped all of that. But now he has three goalkeepers – four if we include Tom Heaton – vying for a spot in the first XI which is about as up for grabs as it’s possible to be as things stand.",
      "The £18m signing is tipped to replace Thibaut Courtois for Belgium when the time comes, but reports claiming he moved to Royal Antwerp because his path to the Club Brugge first team was blocked by Simon Mignolet doesn’t sound hugely encouraging, and we don’t envy any goalkeeper defending the United goal behind that ragtag bunch of defenders, let alone someone with one season of senior football in the Jupiler Pro League.",
      "If anything, Lammens – who is supposedly proficient with both feet when building up from the back – makes more sense as a City addition as backup for Trafford, ready to step in for the academy graduate if needs must, rather than immediately taking his place and leading him to regret a move to Newcastle which might have been, as is likely to be the case as Donnarumma arrives at the Etihad.",
      "‘United’ for ‘City’ on the deal sheet? They probably won’t notice.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly ‘agreed a deal’ with a European giant as they look to offload one of their most experienced players on deadline day.",
      "Man Utd have reached a ‘total agreement’ to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeper Senne Lammens ahead of the deadline, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is on the verge of a move to the Etihad but will have his medical in Italy due to the upcoming international break.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reveals that Ederson to Fenerbahce is ‘here we go’ done as Paris Saint-Germain ‘expect’ Gianluigi Donnarumma to move to Man City.",
      "Man Utd have now ‘agreed personal terms’ to sign Emiliano Martinez as their Aston Villa ‘make approach’ for Senne Lammens, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘leaning towards’ a deal for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez over Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens, according to reports."

      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",

      "Yet Bowen scored as he tends to, Paqueta did the same before mugging off Fabrizio Romano, and Callum Wilson earned a presumably ungodly goal bonus while Crysencio Summerville emerged as a genuine game-changer, Mateus Fernandes showed that midfielders can have mobility and Kyle Walker-Peters actually defended his back post.",
      "Potter’s switch to a four-man defence helped change the mood completely. That was his biggest win in any game since October 2022, and equalled his best ever away in the Premier League. The critics are far from silenced but he will welcome them at least having to mutter under their breath for a while.",

      "“For me it’s important to have the courage to make the decisions and not wait until something happens, because making the decisions with substitutions you can change the game,” he said after turning a 0-0 draw with Ipswich into a 2-0 win in January, which some might argue is roughly the same as conjuring victory from a defeat to Manchester City.",
      "There is definite outcome bias at play; if Brighton had been hit on the break, conceded again and slumped to a loss after that quadruple substitution then Hurzeler would be slammed for his naivety and foolishness. But he sensed a shift in the game with neither side having had a shot for 15 minutes and acted upon it.",
      "Brighton had the next four attempts including James Milner’s penalty equaliser, then weathered a mild two-shot storm in response from the visitors before having seven unanswered efforts on goal, culminating with Brajan Gruda’s winner.",
      "Two substitutes scoring after being introduced at 1-0 down, while Pep Guardiola chucked on Rico Lewis and Ruben Dias to try and salvage a point. As Hurzeler said, it was all about “energy” and “belief”. Rarely do you see either transfer between teams during a game so dramatically.",

      "He must be backed over Marc Guehi. As Glasner said, it’s “tempting” to take the money for a player out of contract at the end of the season, but it feels as though Palace are on the brink of something special and there is a danger of jeopardising that by valuing the financial aspect of a deal too highly.",
      "If keeping Guehi gives them a better chance of renewing Glasner’s own terms before they expire next summer, it is entirely worth taking that hit. Glasner is “responsible for sports” and there is no-one better pound-for-pound in the Premier League, if not across the European coaching landscape as a whole.",

      "One of those victories was in lockdown September against an atrocious Sheffield United; the other came two years ago against Everton, who instead sent them into this international break at as low an ebb as is imaginable for a Premier League side.",
      "Wolves handicap themselves so thoroughly each season that it should come as no surprise. A transfer policy predicated on selling their best players and taking time to replace them with inferior ones means the pressure builds, momentum doesn’t and the revolving door of coaches never really stops spinning.",
      "It just feels like there is probably a middle ground between embracing their position in the food chain and meticulously identifying rough diamonds to polish and upsell, and sacrificing the first three or so matches of every season to facilitate that role. Once clubs get lost in that cycle it tends to end only one way.",

      "“Cam has practiced a lot over the last two weeks during the international break whilst he’s been here and Ben hasn’t,” was Russell Martin’s irrefutable justification for allowing a fortnight of evidence to override two respective careers’ worth of proof.",
      "Southampton never recovered from Andre Onana’s save and were beaten 3-0.",
      "Kevin Schade had never taken a spot kick in his 114-game professional career before stepping up at 0-0 against Sunderland and an imitation of Ivan Toney so pale it would make Casper The Friendly Ghost look tanned suggested he should never have the opportunity again.",

      "Of course a starting line-up in which Bruno Guimaraes had the most career Premier League goals (22) was held to a 0-0 draw. Jacob Murphy (19) and Fabian Schar (18) completed that depressing podium and leaving out £90m of starting wingers before bringing them on with nothing to aim for did not help.",
      "Newcastle lost as many games as they won when having 60 per cent of the ball or more in the Premier League last season. A pair of goalless draws with a possession share only just under that does not suggest the issue has been sorted over a summer of transfer distraction and disturbance.",

      "Manchester United have completed a £18.2m deal to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens; the Belgian shot stopper is now one of four goalkeepers at Man Utd, though they could sell any of the other goalkeepers to Saudi Arabia or Turkey as their windows close later",
      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed the Deadline Day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "United have agreed a deal for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper for around £18.2m plus add-ons.",
      "The club looked at other options, including Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but after much deliberation and negotiation, they feel Lammens is the right choice for the club moving forward.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper impressed United. No 'keeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10, respectively.",
      "It is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for their other goalkeepers, it would be considered.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim had previously said he was happy with his goalkeeping department, despite several high-profile errors from Onana and Bayindir across the early stages of the season.",
      "Lammens is now the fifth signing of the summer for Amorim, taking their summer spend to £232m, following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The keeper was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and the sale represents nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.",
      "He made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season for Antwerp, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "Speaking on the club's official channels after signing, Lammens said:",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential.",
      "\"We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "\"Manchester United have signed Senne Lammens with an eye to the now as well as the future.",
      "\"The 23-year-old keeper, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department after a shaky start to the season by the likes of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp, United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years time.\"",
      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",
      "\"An interesting thing is that when Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, they were tracking him then. So there's obviously been a like there for quite some time.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""

      "",
      "Premier League clubs spent more than £3bn on new signings in total, shattering the previous record of £2.44bn set in 2023.",
      "Clubs also set a record for the amount of money recouped from player sales at £1.8bn. The buying and selling added up to an all-time-high net spend of £1.2bn.",
      "Liverpool spent the most at a record-breaking £446.5m but Arsenal had the highest net spend at £257m, followed by Liverpool at £218.4m, then Spurs and Manchester United.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Bournemouth emerged from the window £65.8m in the black after selling a raft of star players, including defenders Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Isak was the most expensive signing of the window at a British-record £125m, followed by Florian Wirtz at £116.5m, while Hugo Ekitike (£79m, Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool), Benjamin Sesko (£73.7m, RB Leipzig to Man Utd), and Bryan Mbeumo (£71m, Brentford to Man Utd) also made big-money moves.Adam Smith",
      "It seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.",
      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Newcastle finally sanctioned the departure of Isak to Liverpool as they completed the £55m signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford having already brought in Nick Woltemade for £69m from Stuttgart.",
      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",
      "Brighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.",
      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",

      "Given that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.",
      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",
      "Asked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\"Adam Bate",

      "The player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.",
      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",
      "Difficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.",
      "Jackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red.Patrick Rowe",

      "He was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",
      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",

      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",

      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",

      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",

      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",

      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

United did create 3.54 worth of expected goals from 26 shots as they did put Burnley under significant pressure.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho signs for Chelsea in £40m transfer from Man Utd; 21-year-old winger was one of five United player left out of pre-season; Chelsea have spent nearly £300m this summer, with fellow attackers Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens also joining",
      "Saturday 30 August 2025 19:28, UK",
      "Chelsea have signed Alejandro Garnacho in a £40m transfer from Manchester United, taking their summer spend to nearly £300m.",
      "The 21-year-old winger becomes Chelsea's ninth arrival, joining new attackers Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens, and increases their outlay to £296.8m.",
      "Chelsea, though, have recouped £314.4m in sales with 26 players exiting the club either in permanent transfers or on loan.",
      "Garnacho has signed a long-term deal at Chelsea and says he is happy to be joining \"the best team in the world\".",
      "\"I can't wait to get started,\" he told the Chelsea website. \"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"",
      "A compromise over Garnacho's valuation had to be reached as United valued him at £50m, which was more than Chelsea were prepared to pay.",
      "United negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.",
      "The deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest sale of an academy graduate.",
      "Garnacho turned down offers from other clubs because he wanted to move to Chelsea. The winger was told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Chelsea are pulling out of the Nicolas Jackson loan deal to Bayern Munich.",
      "Bayern have been informed that Chelsea will not be able to proceed with the proposed deal due to an injury to Liam Delap against Fulham.",
      "The decision to cancel Jackson's loan was taken after discussions this afternoon between Chelsea's football leadership team and head coach Enzo Maresca.",
      "The player is now expected to return to London. He will go straight back into the first-team squad.",
      "He has been training with the first-team squad as there was always the possibility he would stay.",
      "He signed an extension last September and his contract runs to 2033.",
      "Chelsea have sent Barcelona a £36.6m (€40m) written bid for Fermin Lopez.",
      "They are now waiting for a response after submitting the offer on Saturday.",
      "\"We've reported in the past that Chelsea were considering opening bids of £25m. I know some Manchester United supporters were very angry with those reports.",
      "\"It's all been sorted out now. It's a £40m fixed fee and United will also retain a 10 per cent sell-on clause for the player.",
      "\"This is a significant deal for United. They are often criticised for not getting enough for players and not making money from selling players. This is the largest ever sale for a Manchester United academy product.",
      "\"From United's perspective, they are very, very happy because a £40m fixed fee is a very good deal for them, for a player who didn't really have a future at the club.\"",
      "Speaking earlier this summer, United boss Amorim said: \"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Leny Yoro did not feature in Manchester United's disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup; United still searching for their first win of the season after defeat to Arsenal and a draw at Fulham in the Premier League; they host Burnley on Saturday",
      "By Danyal Khan - @danyalhkhan",
      "Saturday 30 August 2025 18:07, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",
