      "Theo Walcott told Arsenal that they would have been massively helping Bukayo Saka by signing Bryan Mbeumo. The 26-year-old left Brentford last month after he was signed by Manchester United in a blockbuster £71million transfer.",
      "The Cameroon international was said to be of interest to the Gunners as well as Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea but Mbeumo made clear to his former side that a move to Old Trafford was his dream destination.",
      "While Mbeumo and Saka both play on the right side of attack, Walcott admitted he would have been a shrewd signing for Mikel Arteta in order to lessen the workload on the England star.",
      "Saka, 23, has played a whopping 263 games for Arsenal since breaking into the team in 2019 and has lacked competition in his position for the majority of his career in north London.",
      "The absence of a player capable of filling in for him has meant he's played a considerable number of games. His lack of rest may have contributed to the torn hamstring he suffered last season against Crystal Palace, which ruled him out for over three months.",
      "Speaking on the It's Called Soccer podcast with Rebecca Lowe, the 36-year-old was adamant as he said: \"Arsenal should have got Mbeumo many years ago. That was one player I thought, 'take the load off Saka'. I'm a big fan of him.\"",
      "Arsenal fans have already received an injury scare over their prized player after Saka limped off the pitch in their 1-0 pre-season loss to Tottenham last month. Their fears were soon downplayed after he started in their 3-2 loss to Villarreal a week later.",
      "Despite missing out on Mbeumo, the north London side did add attacking firepower in Noni Madueke whose favoured position is on the right wing. The ex-Chelsea man cost £52m and is certainly highly thought of by Arteta who explained what the Englishman will bring to his side.",
      "\"We're all so happy to welcome Noni Madueke to the team,\" the Spaniard said. \"Noni is an exciting and powerful young player, with his performances and numbers in recent seasons being of consistently high quality. He is one of the most talented wide forward players in the Premier League.",
      "\"At just 23, Noni already brings experience of club and international football, and he knows the Premier League very well. Having seen the quality of Noni’s performances up close in recent seasons, we’re really excited he is joining us.",
      "\"Noni joins our group with familiar England teammates and other players he knows. He will be made to feel at home straight away. His arrival will really improve our squad - we’re all thrilled to have him here. From all of us, welcome Noni and welcome to your family.\" Arsenal will kick off their Premier League season away to Manchester United on Sunday.",

      "Gary Neville is surprised that Manchester United splashed over £200million on attacking talent this summer, especially when they still have an unresolved issue elsewhere.",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha (£62.5m from Wolves), Bryan Mbeumo (£71m from Brentford) and Benjamin Sesko (£74m from RB Leipzig) this summer. Ruben Amorim’s side only scored 44 times in 38 Premier League games last season and have acted to add more firepower to the squad that finished 15th.",
      "They managed to attract the trio of forwards despite not being able to offer any European football this season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham in May. United have undoubtedly strengthened their attack, but the only other arrival so far this summer is Diego Leon, an 18-year-old left-back.",
      "Former United defender Neville is pleased with the new signings, but thinks there are still major problems that need to be addressed. He has urged them to buy a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana struggled for consistency once again last season.",
      "“We thought that obviously after the Europa League final, that the money wouldn’t be there at that level. So to get those three players, who look like a really good profile – two of them have Premier League experience – we need them to do well, because the rest of the team…",
      "“We need a goalkeeper. There are definitely issues with the defence and midfield. But if the three strikers are a real handful and are scoring goals… last season United’s return in front of goal was really poor, so it’s really important that Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha get off to a really good start.",
      "“We’ve seen a Liverpool striker (Hugo Ekitike) do that tonight. There’s no reason why United strikers can’t go and do that on Sunday.”",
      "United begin their campaign against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday and have until September 1 to make any more additions to their side. The club are desperately trying to offload Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia so they can reinvest in Amorim’s squad.",
      "They are prioritising a holding midfielder, but have also been linked with goalkeepers, including Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain, Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez and Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Asked what a good season would be for United, Neville replied: “I think top six would be a good season. I think the four at the top – Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, City – will be difficult to challenge.",
      "“But they could slip into that space where other clubs are, Newcastle, Tottenham, Villa, so that fifth place would be absolutely amazing. Realistically, I think it’s probably going to be between sixth and eighth, but I think fifth is where they have to target.”",

      "Robin van Persie declined to pick a side when asked to choose between former sides Manchester United and Arsenal. The striker made the controversial switch from the Emirates to Old Trafford in 2012.",
      "Van Persie's two old sides collide on Sunday as the Red Devils get their Premier League campaign underway when they host last year's runners-up Arsenal. Ruben Amorim's side will be keen to prove they are no pushovers after a dismal 15th-placed finish, while Mikel Arteta's men have their eyes on the crown after playing second-fiddle for three consecutive seasons.",
      "Van Persie has controversially donned the kits of both English heavyweights, but he refused to nail his colours to either mast when questioned in March about his preferences.",
      "Speaking to ESPN at the beginning of the year, the Dutchman was quizzed on whether he favoured former team-mates Wayne Rooney or Thierry Henry, and opted to sit on the fence.",
      "He simply replied: \"Pass because they're both so different and very good.\" He was then pressed to choose between his legendary managers Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson, but gave a similar response, reports the Mirror.",
      "Van Persie added: \"Definitely both,\" whilst offering the same diplomatic answer when asked to pick between former employers Arsenal or United.",
      "His indecision even extended to the clubs' respective rivals, Manchester City and Tottenham, with the ex-striker sighing in frustration before dodging a question about them entirely.",
      "The Dutchman netted 132 goals in 278 appearances for Arsenal before his contentious switch to United, where he claimed the Premier League title in his first campaign.",
      "Despite the backlash over the move, Wenger revealed that Van Persie had expressed a desire to return to North London, but it simply could not materialise.",
      "Speaking about their relationship, Wenger said: \"In 2012, he announced his intention not to extend his contract. All the big clubs were courting him. I sold him to Manchester United.",
      "\"The supporters were angry with me for this but we could not match the offer. I managed to negotiate his departure for £24million, which was a huge amount at the time for a player with a year left on his contract. I had only the interest of the club in mind.",
      "\"My relationship with Alex Ferguson and Manchester United had improved by then, but every transfer is a polite game of poker where you attempt to give not anything away.",
      "\"Van Persie had a fantastic first six months at Old Trafford: he put the team on track for the Premiership title and made it even more difficult for us.\"",
      "Wenger added: \"After three years of the four that he signed for, he was injured and Van Gaal sold him to the Turkish club Fenerbahce. He called me because he wanted to come back, but it was impossible: he was at the end of his career and we were investing in young players.\"",

      "With Manchester United splashing the cash on Benjamin Sesko, Rasmus Hojlund has essentially been told to pack his bags. The Danish striker, 22, has mustered just 26 goals over two years for the Red Devils.",
      "Ruben Amorim's arsenal has been significantly bolstered during this window, with over £200million spent on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and now athletic marksman Sesko, whose £74m arrival was announced last weekend. With so many ins, there must be outs, and one name who looks all but certain to depart is Hojlund.",
      "Despite decreeing in pre-season that he would remain and fight for his spot at Old Trafford no matter what, a sharp change in tune has been reported, with the likes of AC Milan lining up to take on the £72m man. While an expected exit has only materialised this summer, Hojlund's ability has been leaving people unconvinced for some time.",
      "He arrived fresh-faced in 2023, having looked a raw but talented prospect for Serie A side Atalanta. Some immediately baulked at his price tag, as he had only scored 10 times for the Italian side, and it continued to loom as he settled in under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Hojlund took until December to score his first Premier League goal, raising further doubts. Heading into early 2024, after a barren run of just one goal in 10 matches, worrying rumours spilled from Old Trafford.",
      "It was reported in May of 2024 that some of the striker's team-mates were reluctant to pass Hojlund the ball during matches, as they were concerned about his finishing abilities. These suggestions were denied by the club.",
      "Although his debut campaign saw him register a modest 16 goals across all competitions, last season saw a significant drop-off and lack of trust from new boss Amorim. Hojlund netted just four times in the top flight as United finished 15th.",
      "Hojlund was bullish when this pre-season arrived, declaring last month that he would fight for his place in Manchester. But after Sesko's services were secured, an interview given by United's head coach and a telling team selection acted as a coup de grâce.",
      "Sesko was presented to the Old Trafford faithful last Saturday before a pre-season friendly against Fiorentina, which ended 1-1, and Amorim was asked about his new signing, dishing out a sucker punch in Hojlund's direction.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" Amorim told MUTV regarding Sesko, suggesting that Hojlund does not possess such attributes. \"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite!",
      "\"That is also important. He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential.",
      "\"I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "A second blow was dealt when it came to team selections. Even with new recruit Sesko ineligible, Amorim opted for usual midfielder Mason Mount as a false nine instead of Hojlund.",
      "This move essentially signalled Hojlund's exit and absence from Amorim's plans, and talkSPORT have reported that he has come to terms with a move away after his pre-season plea fell on deaf ears.",
      "Milan looks the most likely destination, with it being suggested a fee in the region of £30m could be enough to get a deal done. What is almost certain is that Hojlund's nightmare in Manchester will soon come to an end, and for potentially less than half of what he was purchased for.",

      "Carlos Baleba is prepared to keep pushing for a move to Manchester United after they chose not to pursue a deal this summer. Baleba, 21, emerged as the Red Devils' top target amid their search for a defensive midfielder.",
      "Talks began with Brighton earlier this month via intermediaries who were working on United's behalf. The two clubs then engaged in direct contact, as Brighton made it clear that they don't intend to sell the Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba's side informed United that it'd take a bid of around £120m - more than what Brighton sold Moises Caicedo to Chelsea for in 2023 - for them to consider his sale. As reported by the Athletic, that's beyond what Red Devils would be willing to pay this summer.",
      "The development reflects Fabian Hurzeler's comments on Friday, as the Brighton manager declared that he was 'very, very, very confident' about Baleba staying. When asked why, Hurzeler replied: \"Just my belief.\"",
      "United have already welcomed three signings for a combined £207.5m - Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. All three of them are forwards and Ruben Amorim's priority is now in midfield, specifically the No.6 role.",
      "The Red Devils could choose to be patient and return to the negotiating table next year or sign an alternative now. Personal terms wouldn't have been a problem with Baleba, as he's willing to push for the move even if it means waiting.",
      "However, there's no suggestion that the ex-Lille starlet is unhappy at Brighton. At Old Trafford, there's an acceptance that Baleba is still developing after two seasons in the Premier League.",
      "The 21-year-old will hope to boost his stock over the course of the new season and Hurzeler is excited to keep working with him. \"I didn't see any change [in Baleba],\" the Seagulls boss added ahead of Saturday's season opener against Fulham.",
      "\"He only changed his hair, so I think that was the only change he made the last two weeks. But overall, he seems to be in a really good place. He's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player.",

The Chilean spent three-and-a-half years in north London and accrued an impressive 80 goals and 44 assists in 160 games for the Gunners.",
      "Having established himself as one of the best players in the Premier League after a three-year stint at Barcelona, where he won everything but the Champions League, then-United boss Jose Mourinho came calling in 2018.",
      "In what was a rare transfer situation, United and Arsenal - who clash on Sunday in their first Premier League game of the season -opted to complete a swap deal, with Sanchez moving to Manchester, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan going in the opposite direction in January 2018.",
      "Prior to the move being completed, Sanchez had scored seven goals in 19 league games, a relatively slow start for the winger, given that he had netted 24 goals the season before.",
      "In a devastating drop-off in form, Sanchez scored just two more league goals for the rest of the season. He ended his first six months as a Red Devil with three goals in 18 games across all competitions.",
      "Speaking in 2020, Sanchez admitted he was initially positive about becoming a United player but those thoughts were swiftly dashed after just one training session. \"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting, and it was something good for me,\" he said.",
      "\"I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually, I signed, but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club. Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things.",
      "\"After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?' They laughed. I told them there was something that didn't sit right, it didn't seem good. But I had already signed; I was already there. After the first few months, I carried on having the same feeling. We weren't united as a team in that moment.\"",
      "Sanchez's sophomore season at United, which was also his last, was even worse than his debut campaign. He managed just one league goal in 20 games and was resigned to a bench role for much of the season.",
      "After being dropped for an away trip to West Ham because he failed to score in the first six league games of the season, Sanchez said Mourinho's decision to relegate him dented his confidence.",
      "\"In a game with West Ham, I wasn't picked,\" Sanchez continued. \"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me, and I said it couldn't be possible. \"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house, and I was very sad. The next day, I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\"",
      "United chiefs called time on the failed experiment as Sanchez was sent out on loan to Inter Milan in 2019 before making the switch permanent a year later.",
      "He's since turned out for Marseille before returning to Inter in 2023 for just a season as he secured a return to fellow Serie A side Udinese, the first European club he played for after leaving his homeland.",

      "Manchester United have been told their decision to sign Benjamin Sesko is a \"mistake\" and that they should have bought Ollie Watkins instead. United have spent big on attacking reinforcements this summer, forking out almost £200million for Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "However, former Red Devils star Nicky Butt, who won six Premier League titles at Old Trafford, believes Watkins would have been a better option due to his experience. Watkins has spent five season in the Premier League with Aston Villa and hit double figures in all of them.",
      "\"I know Cunha has done really well over the last couple of seasons but I would really like an experienced striker,\" Butt told BetMGM. \"I hope I'm wrong but I really hope they aren't making the same mistakes with Sesko as they did with Rasmus [Hojlund].",
      "\"A young player coming in with no Premier League experience, it just feels like history repeating itself. Honestly, for what it would have cost, I would have gone and brought in someone like Ollie Watkins, someone to help and pull the young strikers out of a bad patch.",
      "\"When young players are just coming into the club, when the onus is on them to score goals, if they're having a few bad games they have to have the safety net of being pulled out of the firing line. Ollie Watkins, or someone like that, would be who I would have been looking to bring in.\"",
      "Butt's comments come after Arsenal legend Tony Adams expressed a similar sentiment, claiming the Gunners should have signed Watkins instead of Viktor Gyokeres. When asked about Gyokeres during a Q & A for Indo Sport, Adams said: \"I don't know yet.",
      "\"He's not tried and tested. I would have liked to have seen them get Ollie Watkins to be honest with you. He's a Gooner, he might have given us a year and we might have won the title.\"",
      "Adams also expressed concerns about Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and club captain Martin Odegaard. When asked for his thoughts on Arteta, Adams responded: \"Ahhhh… [audience laughs]… What?! Was there too much of a long pause there?",
      "\"I think he's got a really big call to make this year and, for me, he hasn't done it and the call is to make Declan Rice captain. Declan is my kind of captain and it might free up [Martin] Odegaard up to play with a bit more freedom because he had a very average season last year.\"",
      "\"But I think sometimes when you've got the main man and the captain of the club… Terry Venables did it, he took it off David Platt and he put me as captain and Glenn Hoddle took me out and put Alan Shearer, which was a silly decision!",
      "\"But every now and again, as a manager, you have to put someone that reflects you, reflects the football club, someone who thinks can actually take you to the next level. I think Rice is an Arsenal leader, I think he is.",
      "\"He's good in the dressing room, around the training camp. He's got standards, he's got principles and I can see the man and he's a proper player, a proper captain. I would have done it, but Arteta hasn't done it so I'm being critical of Arteta at the moment. Big managers go, 'Right actually, you're my man now!'\"",

      "“When I go to sign a player, sometimes it’s on Zoom and I open the laptop, it’s the first impression. Is this guy ready to put that jersey on, work in that dressing room and take all the noise that is surrounding his signing and deal with it in the right way?”",
      "Arsenal star Martin Zubimendi has revealed why he chose to pursue a move to the Emirates just 12 months after rejecting Liverpool. Speaking to DAZN Espana, the midfielder said: “Last year, I also had my doubts.",
      "“I felt I could still contribute a lot to Real Sociedad and that I still had steps to take. But this summer, I felt like my time had come.",
      "“Once the signing was close, we talked, but he [Arteta] didn’t need to convince me. I already knew what I wanted by seeing how the team played.”",

      "United finished 15th in the league and failed to qualify for the Champions League after they were beaten in the Europa League final by Tottenham. Ruben Amorim has strengthened his squad this summer, bringing in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler says he is \"very confident\" that Carlos Baleba will not be sold this summer, despite strong interest from Old Trafford.",
      "When asked about the midfielder's future ahead of Brighton's opening game of the new season, Hurzeler said: \"I didn't see any change, he's only changed his hair. I think that's the change he's made in the last two weeks.",
      "\"But overall he seems to be in a really good place, he's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player. I didn't see any big changes and he's an option to start tomorrow. Very very very confident [he will stay], that's just my belief.\"",
      "According to a report from the Sun, Manchester United are considering a move for Morten Hjulmand as a potential alternative to Carlos Baleba. The report states that the Sporting captain would 'cost less than half' what it would take to sign Baleba, with Hjulmand valued at around £50m.",
      "As a result, it is claimed that United could use the money saved by signing Hjulmand to fund a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Paris Saint-Germain star is expected to leave this summer after they signed a new goalkeeper in Lucas Chevalier.",

      "\"It's certainly important that he hits the ground running,\" he said at an event with ESPN. \"I thought it was an incredible move for him, to be very honest. The last couple of seasons at Manchester United, the way Manchester United performed - for him to leave and go to arguably one of the most exciting teams in Europe, I thought: 'He's got an amazing agent.'",
      "\"Where's he going to fit in? The answer is, I don't know. Because Raphinha, Robert [Lewandowski] and Lamine [Yamal], they had the most incredible season. So you think that is set in stone. You've got Ferran [Torres] behind them. They've moved a couple of players out - if anything, when you look at Barcelona's team, they need a couple of more defenders... but they go and bring in yet another forward. So we'll wait and see.\"",

The winger has been left out of United's pre-season tour, with Chelsea closing in on a cut-price deal, but their London rivals turned to other targets after exploring a shock deal.",
      "The Gunners ended up turning their attentions to Noni Madueke, who joined from Chelsea in a £48millon deal. And they weren't the only ones to move on from Garnacho.",
      "Those teams also ultimately looked elsewhere. Spurs paid £55m to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, while Atleti added both Alex Baena and Thiago Almada.",
      "Chelsea are understood to have agreed personal terms with Garnacho, with negotiations over a fee ongoing. They have until September 1 to get a deal done, with United already dropping their asking price since the Blues' January interest.",
      "Garnacho featured in all but two of United's Premier League matches last season, scoring six goals. He didn't start any of the final three games, though, and the writing appeared to be on the wall after he was left out of the starting line-up for the Europa League final.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" he said after the defeat against Spurs. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",

Spain international Zubimendi has been signed to take Arsenal to the next level and improve their midfield.",
      "The playmaker cost £55.8million from Real Sociedad, making him the Gunners' second-most expensive signing of the summer transfer window. And it's good news for fans wanting to see him in competitive action for the first time, having shown glimpses of his quality in pre-season.",
      "\"Yes, he had a great integration,\" Arteta told reporters when asked if Zubimendi would be available. \"As everybody can see this immediately, he's had a very big impact on the team. I'm really happy and he will be fit.",
      "Trossard, who's been linked with a move away this summer, is expected to join him in Arsenal's matchday squad. \"Yeah, I think he's much better,\" Arteta added. \"I think he will be able to train again tomorrow (Saturday) and if that's the case, he will be fit.\"",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has faced a barrage of questions about Manchester United's interest in Carlos Baleba. However, he remains confident that the £100million-rated youngster will stay put this summer.",
      "United already splashed out over £200m to strengthen Ruben Amorim's attack with the likes of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, following a lengthy saga, and Bryan Mbeumo all recruited. The Red Devils are now keen to bolster their midfield and some United stars are believed to have even reached out to Baleba in order to convince him to move to Old Trafford.",
      "The Seagulls' young Cameroonian star is top of United's wish list, and it's reported that contact was made last week, although United do have alternatives in mind. Ahead of Brighton's season opener against Fulham on Saturday, head coach Hurzeler fielded numerous queries about Baleba, with the German showing a defiant stance on his young star.",
      "It's now believed that United have decided to postpone a move for the 21-year-old due to his hefty £100m plus price tag. Interest is set to be reignited next year, and while all hope isn't lost, senior figures at the club think a deal in this transfer window before 1 September is unlikely.",
      "Nevertheless, in Hurzeler's view, any potential move for the costly Baleba will definitely have to wait until this current Premier League campaign concludes. Here's what he revealed about the United target on Friday as three crucial questions were addressed.",
      "Hurzeler: \"Very, very, very confident [that he will not leave]. Yes. This is just my belief.\"",

      "Adam Wharton could have saved his grandparents a lot of worry by signing for Manchester United back in 2024 - but it was Crystal Palace who took the gamble on him instead. Fast forward 18 months and the Eagles can now command a huge fee for the England international thanks to his impressive displays in south London.",
      "Wharton's career has been on a meteoric rise since his days at Ewood Park, where he made 44 appearances and scored four goals from midfield. Last year, it was reported that United scouts were among those keeping tabs on the promising 21-year-old.",
      "Despite interest from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, it was Palace who secured the youngster's signature in a deal worth up to £22m. With 36 Premier League appearances already to his name – not to mention victories in the FA Cup and Community Shield – Wharton has been turning heads at both club and international level.",
      "The talented midfielder was also called up to the England senior team for Euro 2024, just days after making his international debut for the Three Lions in June.",
      "All of that combines to make Wharton an extremely valuable asset for Palace, with some fans rating him as a £100m player. However, it is understood that the Eagles value Wharton a slightly more modest £60m, which still represents a marked uptick on the price the Red Devils could have signed him for in 2024.",
      "A move up north would have also been a preference for his family life, as his dad revealed last year that his grandmothers were \"worried sick\" about him relocating to south London to play for Palace – although father John insists he hasn't regretted the move since.",
      "The English star is one of two players that Ruben Amorim is pondering over adding to his midfield this summer, with Carlos Baleba being the more likely choice. However, United may have repeated their error with the Brighton ace, as he was up for grabs for a mere £23m back in 2023.",
      "While playing for Lille, the 21-year-old caught the eye of the Old Trafford club, but the Seagulls snapped him up on a five-year contract instead. Now, they value Baleba at over £100m – meaning Amorim's squad would be shelling out £81m more than necessary if they decide to swoop for the Cameroonian.",
      "With Wharton as a possible alternative, supporters might be hoping that this transfer could be slightly less complicated; but that's not the case. The sale of the England midfielder could hinge entirely on Palace's ability to keep hold of other star players in their team, specifically Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "Liverpool have shown serious interest in luring Guehi away from the club he leads, tabling an offer potentially worth £35m. While the Eagles have no intention of allowing their star defender to depart, the 25-year-old's deal runs out next summer - and Guehi appears content to run down his existing contract.",
      "Eze is similarly drawing attention this summer, with both north London clubs keen on securing the talented midfielder's services. Arsenal and Tottenham are potentially planning to wait out the England international's £68m release clause, which expires at the end of this week.",
      "Wharton's potential departure may hinge entirely on whether one or both of his teammates seek fresh challenges elsewhere. With Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all in the building ahead of United's league opener against the Gunners on Sunday, Amorim is eager to kickstart his vision at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking about his \"selection headache\" before the Premier League curtain-raiser earlier this week, the manager told MUTV: \"That [a selection headache] is a good thing, it is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "\"It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.\"",

      "The 43-year-old has officiated more than 120 games in England's top flight during his career. But Hooper found himself at the heart of controversy when United edged out Wolves 1-0 at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the 2023/24 season.",
      "It was his decision not to award Wolves a penalty in the dying moments of that match. All eyes turned to Hooper when United debutant Andre Onana collided with striker Sasa Kalajdzic while attempting to intercept a cross.",
      "But the Cameroon international got his timing wrong and clattered into the Wolves frontman while aiming for the ball. The result was widespread furore, with then-Wolves boss Gary O'Neil among the most incensed.",
      "O'Neil revealed after the match that the visiting team had received an apology from Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). This was of course in relation to Hooper's failure to award a penalty, frustrating the team that they had been deprived a potential equaliser.",
      "Hooper was subsequently dropped from the refereeing roster for the following weekend's fixtures, as he was taken out of the firing line.",
      "As if the apology wasn't enough acknowledgement that he had got the call wrong, his omission from the next round of games only added to Wolves' frustration.",
      "Hooper will be supported by Adrian Holmes and Simon Long at Old Trafford this Sunday, with Jarred Gillett acting as the fourth official. Paul Tierney will be handling VAR duties, assisted by Steven Meredith.",
      "United haven't won a league fixture against the Gunners since September 2022, though they did knock them out of last term's FA Cup third round on penalties.",

      "Ian Wright reckons Viktor Gyokeres will be on another level to Benjamin Sesko in the Premier League this season. The former Arsenal striker hit back at double standards from Gary Neville over what would constitute a positive season for the division's newest forwards.",
      "The Gunners were in the market for both players before opting to sign Gyokeres in a deal worth close to £64million. The Swede arrives from Sporting CP after averaging more than a goal per game last season.",
      "Sesko meanwhile, despite interest from Newcastle United, ultimately chose to join Manchester United in a deal worth up to £74m. Both goalscorers could feature as the two historied rivals meet in their opening fixture.",
      "But former Manchester United captain Gary Neville caught Wright's ire when establishing targets for the Red Devils' new frontline. The Salford City owner wants to see Sesko, along with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, combine to hit 35 goals, of which the Slovenia international could be content with ten.",
      "Wright was incredulous at Neville's suggestion after the pundit had disregarded the same figure being enough for Gyokeres. “You look at Sesko and he scored 13 goals in 38 games in the German league (sic), Marmoush left in December (23 January) and had 15,” Wright said on the Overlap.",
      "“That says to me as a striker that he should be scoring more at that level, so you’re coming to United… I think Gyökeres… he’s got such great ability and physical, I think he’s going to be another [level]. He’ll get 15 [goals].",
      "“But that is a worry, 13 for a whole season, that would be a worry for me… what if he [Sesko] got 10 goals [in the Premier League ]? What if he got 10? Because you just turned your nose up at me when I mentioned Gyökeres and 10 [goals], and now you’re thinking about Šeško and 10 [goals].\"",
      "\"I don’t care [that Gyökeres is further in his career],\" he added. \"It’s Man United and you have to expect it… am I hearing this right?! Why can’t I have [10 goals] for Gyökeres? When I said 10 you turned your nose up like I was smelling poo.”",
      "Sesko's agent recent gave his interpretation of why a move to Arsenal did not materialise despite the Gunners making the early progress for a transfer. \"It's hard to say exactly,\" Elvis Basanovic said.",

      "Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui will both miss Manchester United's Premier League opener against Arsenal, Ruben Amorim has confirmed. The Red Devils welcome the Gunners to Old Trafford on Sunday to kick off their 2025-26 campaign.",
      "Amorim will be desperate for a positive start given United's dire season last time out. But his side will have to take on Mikel Arteta 's men without two crucial defenders.",
      "Martinez will miss the game as he continues his recovery from a long-term knee issue, while Mazraoui is sidelined with a hamstring strain. Amorim has however confirmed that both Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee could potentially play, while Benjamin Sesko is in line for a debut.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: \"No, Licha [Lisandro Martinez] and Mazraoui are out, they cannot play this game. Josh [Zirkzee] and Andre [Onana] are recovering and are options. We'll see.\"",
      "On Sesko he added: “Sesko is ready to play on the physical point of view… he is ready, a big component in our league. Then he is really smart, every detail he asks, he is always thinking. We will see if he starts”.",
      "United have an otherwise clean bill of health aside from those four. Amorim's United face a tough start to the campaign with clashes against Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea to come before October. Asked about his targets for the forthcoming campaign, Amorim replied: \"It's hard to know.",
      "\"We cannot change everything in four weeks, but we are better. We are training harder and are more prepared to cope with the demands of the game. I'm really more confident, that is clear. Step by step, we will be a better team.\"",
      "\"We want to return to Europe,\" Amorim added. \"We have to be realistic with our fans. We will have to fight a lot because there are more teams with time together than us. We have to focus game by game. We want to win against Arsenal.\"",
      "Amorim has also claimed he is now better equipped to face adversity at Old Trafford, having learned plenty of lessons from the club's woes of the past year. He said: \"I learned a lot last season. I don't need to focus on the future.",
      "\"That doesn't matter and I don't care. I need to live day by day. Everything that is noise to our team, I take out of the picture, so I just prepare my team against Arsenal.\"",
      "Following the clash with Arsenal, United then face a trip to Fulham next weekend ahead of taking on Grimsby Town in the second round of the Carabao Cup following Wednesday evening's draw.",

      "The new Premier League season gets underway on Friday evening when defending champions Liverpool host Bournemouth at Anfield. Arne Slot's side are hoping to go back-to-back for the first time in more 40 years, with the chasing pack hoping for a slip up.",
      "There is also the battle for survival as the three promoted clubs, Sunderland, Leeds and Burnley, look to buck the trend of the past two seasons and finish above the dreaded dotted line.",
      "The first week of the season also marks the point when every fanbase - up and down the country - can dream of a brilliant season, before the reality sets in for most.",
      "But despite a summer that included no major international tournaments, managers are still facing some injury headaches with all 20 sides dealing with absences.",
      "The likes of Chelsea star Levi Colwill and Tottenham playmaker James Maddison have suffered serious injuries in pre-season, while Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez and Arsenal's Gabriel Jesus are still dealing with issues picked up last season.",
      "Mikel Arteta will be without Gabriel Jesus for the foreseeable future after he suffered an ACL injury against Manchester United back in January, but Leandro Trossard should be available for selection.",
      "Arteta said: \"Yeah I think [Trossard is] much better,\" he said. \"I think he will be able to train again tomorrow and if that's the case, he will be fit.\"",
      "New signing Martin Zubimendi will also feature, after overcoming a brief illness which saw him miss the club's media day. He added: \"Yes he had a great integration a very big impact and he will be fit,\" he said.",
      "Andres Garcia, Ross Barkley and Morgan Rodgers are all doubts for Villa's Premier League opener vs Newcastle. However, hopes have been raises that the trio could be available after being pictured in first-team training this week.",
      "There has been plenty of speculation that goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez could move on from B6 this summer, and Unai Emery will get a glimpse of life without the World Cup winner this weekend. Martinez is on the sidelines through suspension after he was sent off in their agonising final-day defeat at Old Trafford which cost them the Champions League.",
      "Andoni Iraola is already looking at fielding at a very different Cherries XI on Friday night with the majority of their back five from last season moving on. Kepa - who spent last season on loan from Chelsea - is now with Arsenal, Dean Huijsen has joined Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi has signed for PSG, while Milos Kerkez will be lining up against them at Anfield.",
      "And Iraola will be missing even more stars for their first match against Liverpool, with Enes Unal, Lewis Cook, Ryan Christie and Justin Kluivert all sidelined with injuries. Luis Sinisterra is another doubt, while Dango Outtara is unlikely to feature as he closes in on a move to Brentford.",
      "\"Justin hasn't been training with us and won't play,\" Iraola said. \"Ryan has been training this week with us, which is positive. It's too early for him to play as he hasn't done any pre-season. He hasn't done a lot of things for a lot of weeks, so it's too early - but it's good to have him back on the pitch with the group.\"",
      "New Brentford boss Keith Andrews has confirmed that Vitaly Janelt, Gustavo Nunez and Paris Maghoma will miss their opener against Nottingham Forest, while Caoimhin Kelleher and Kevin Schade are doubts.",
      "\"From the ones that missed last Friday, Caoimhin and Kevin Schade are back on the grass; whether they'll be ready, we'll see over the next day or so and make that decision,\" he said.",
      "Yoane Wissa will also miss the game amid speculation over his future, with Andrews adding: \"I've made the decision that he's not [available]. It's been a very disruptive pre-season and everyone is aware of that.",
      "\"There's been interest in Yoane and I've been very clear on the situation. As a head coach, I want Yoane in the building and I want him to be a part of the first-team squad. I'm very understanding of his situation and I've got a very good relationship with him, but we have to focus on the players that are ready to play and perform on Sunday, and I don't think Yoane's in that place.\"",
      "The Seagulls will be without Solly March, Adam Webster and Julio Enciso when they host Fulham on Saturday, with the trio all currently dealing with knee injuries. Jack Hinshelwood and new signing Charalampos Kostoulas are also doubts.",
      "Carlos Baleba is an option to start for Brighton though, with manager Fabian Hurzeler confirming the midfielder is fully committed to the club amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Burnley will kickstart their new season against Tottenham and Zeki Amdouni, Benson Manuel, Jordan Beyer and Bashir Humphreys are set to miss the game as they continue their recovery from long-term injuries.",
      "Axel Tuanzebe, Connor Roberts and Zian Flemming are also doubts, while it remains to be seen if new signings Martin Dubravka, Armando Broja and Lesley Ugochukwu are risked against Spurs.",
      "Levi Colwill could miss the entire season after he underwent ACL surgery earlier this month, while Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia and Omari Kellyman are also out with injuries. Mykhailo Mudryk is currently suspended after he was charged by the FA over Anti-Doping Rule Violations.",
      "Nicolas Jackson will miss Chelsea's opener after being sent off against Newcastle last season, while Wesley Fofana's involvement against Crystal Palace is doubtful. \"Fofana could be available - we will see,\" manager Enzo Maresca said.",
      "\"Benoit is in the process of coming back and Romeo is exactly the same. Trevoh [Chalobah] is okay.\"",
      "Oliver Glasner will be without Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Eddie Nketiah, Matheus Franca and Caleb Kporha when Crystal Palace face Chelsea in their opening game of the season.",
      "Dalchi Kamada will also miss the trip across the capital after being forced off with an injury during their Community Shield win over Liverpool last weekend.",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite will miss the start of the new season with a hamstring injury, while it appears Everton can call on Vitalii Mykolenko, Nathan Patterson and Harrison Armstrong for their first game against Leeds.",
      "Jack Grealish is also in line to make his Toffees bow, despite arriving on loan from Manchester City just a matter of days ago.",
      "Antonee Robinson will miss Fulham's opener against Brighton after undergoing knee surgery, while Ryan Gravenberch is a doubt after picking up a knock during their final pre-season game against Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Defenders Jayden Bogle and Sebastiaan Bornauw are doubts for Leeds' clash with Everton on Monday, while new signing Jaka Bijol is suspended after he was sent off in his final Serie A game for Udinese last season.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin is also set to become a Leeds player, though it remains to be seen whether he has been registered in time to play for his new club this weekend.",
      "Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez are both injury doubts after missing the Community Shield, with Liverpool boss Arne Slot saying of Gomez: \"I have to make a decision on that. I think he only trained twice now, missed quite a lot in pre-season.",
      "\"But if you looked at our bench against Palace, I think there were three players that were 20 years old or younger. So, there is a possibility that Joe might be on the bench but I have to look at the numbers and who we’re going to take.\"",
      "Ryan Gravenberch will miss the opening game against Bournemouth through suspension, having been sent off against Crystal Palace on the final day of last season.",
      "Mateo Kovacic and Claudio Echeverri will both miss Manchester City's opener against Wolves, while Rodri is likely out until September after picking up an injury at the Club World Cup. Jokso Gvardiol and Savinho will also miss the trip to the Midlands with injuries.",
      "Most intriguingly though, Ederson is also set to be absent from their matchday squad. The Brazilian has been linked with an exit, with reports Gianluigi Donnarumma is waiting in the wings to replace him. For this Saturday at least, James Trafford is in line for his chance.",
      "Lisandro Martinez remains sidelined after suffering a serious knee injury last season, while Noussair Mazraoui is also out of action. Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee remain injury doubts, but the pair were back training with the rest of the squad earlier this week.",
      "Ruben Amorim said: \"No, Licha [Martinez] and Mazraoui are out, they cannot play this game. Josh and Andre are recovering and are options. We'll see.\"",
      "New signing Benjamin Sesko could start on his debut, with Amorim confirming the £74m star is physically ready.",
      "Joe Willock remains out of action with a calf injury, while Alexander Isak will not be involved amid ongoing uncertainty about his future. \"Alex's situation has been unchanged for a while, and that will continue to be the case,\" Newcastle boss Eddie Howe said ahead of their opener against Aston Villa.",
      "\"I've had a great relationship with Alex. You need that with every player. I take my part in that relationship really importantly. I have to work really closely with the player to his benefit.\"",
      "Nicolas Dominguez is the only absentee for Nuno Espirito Santo, with the Nottingham Forest star sidelined with a serious knee injury. Reports claimed in May that Dominguez would be sidelined for at least four months.",
      "Sunderland have a number of injury problems ahead of their opener against West Ham, with Romaine Mundle, Aljibola Alese, Leo Hjelde and Dennis Cirkin all sidelined. Manager Regis Le Bris has also admitted new signing Omar Alderete is \"probably not really ready to start a game\".",
      "Fellow new signings Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku are also doubts, with Le Bris adding: \"I think with Marc, Arthur and Omar, we are going to have the opportunity to select them. I think it might be a little bit tough to start because of their fitness levels and because they have not had much time with their teammates, but that is a decision we will make on Friday morning.\"",
      "James Maddison could miss the entire season after suffering an ACL injury in pre-season, while Radu Dragusin, Dejan Kulusevski, Destiny Udgoie, Bryan Gil and Kota Takai will also miss their opener through injury.",
      "Manor Solomon is a doubt with a \"minor calf injury\", but Yves Bissouma is available for the game against Burnley after missing the Super Cup defeat to Paris Saint-Germain due to disciplinary reasons.",
      "\"Every player who was available [on Wednesday] is available for the team,\" Thomas Frank said. \"Destiny [Udogie] is progressing but it's too early for him to be involved in the squad. Bissouma was a situation. I addressed it, there was a consequence. He will be in the squad tomorrow.\"",
      "Crysencio Summerville and George Earthy are set to miss West Ham's opening game against Sunderland on Saturday with thigh and ankle injuries respectively.",
      "Yerson Mosquera is likely to be on the bench as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury. Fabio Silva is unlikely to be involved while his future remains up in the air, while Leon Chiwone will also miss Wolves' first game of the season against Manchester City on Saturday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The top-flight returns after three long months on Friday evening as the reigning champions welcome Bournemouth to Anfield. Arne Slot's side will be looking to get off to the perfect start after a dominant title win last term, whilst Andoni Iraola's Cherries will look to mount an upset after narrowly missing out on European competition.",
      "Liverpool are favourites to go back-to-back, and that's exactly what Red Devils legend Ferdinand thinks they'll do again. He has Arsenal to finish second, with Manchester City and Chelsea rounding out the top four.",
      "At the other end of the table he has the three promoted sides - Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland all dropping. But in between that, the selections get a little funky.",
      "Ferdinand took to TikTok ahead of the new season to forecast where every side would finish, and did so using a filter that randomly selected a team. He would then place sides on a blank table continuously until complete, leaving room for some blunders.",
      "In total, the former England defender ended up immediately changing his mind on five different teams - incorrectly putting Tottenham ahead of Newcastle in fifth and placing Crystal Palace, Brighton and Aston Villa both in the lower half of the table.",

      "Those in Manchester, after spending £200million on their frontline, are now looking to bolster their midfield. The finances of the deal could yet prove beyond them with Brighton looking for around £100m before they consider letting Baleba leave the club.",
      "United are prepared to delay a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba until next year due to the difficulties involved, but the MEN claims that the 21-year-old would keen on making the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Hurzeler is heading into his second season in charge and has had Baleba as part of his pre-season preparations. Despite talk of a move away the manager insists he's seen no change in the player's demeanour and believes he's committed to the cause. He said: \"I didn't see any change, he only changed his hair! He is enjoying being a Brighton player.\"",
      "Already this summer Brighton have sold Joao Pedro, who left for Chelsea in a deal worth £60m, which has lessened their need to part with their top talent. The Seagulls have previously been willing to let their star men go, but only once they've landed huge profits.",

We hope he'll be here for years to come - but its subject to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",

The Dane would be available for £50m, which is notably less than his £68m release clause.

      "\"Matheus is a sort of player that you don’t see as much now because the game is extremely tactical. I've talked to him on a matchday about something and he's been like ‘it’s okay, I’ll figure it out, don’t worry’.",
      "\"I remember Bobby Robson telling a story about Paul Gascoigne at the 1990 World Cup when England played against Germany. He wanted to speak to Gazza about Lothar Matthaus and he just said 'boss, smoke your cigar and leave him to me.' That’s a little bit like Matheus. He wants to feel the game.\"",
      "Burchnall spent a season and a half working as a first-team coach at Wolves when Gary O'Neil was in charge and his time at Molineux coincided with Cunha playing the most consistent football of his career.",
      "Cunha has said O'Neil \"understood him completely\" at Wolves and credited him for finding joy in his football again. The Brazilian was not an established starter during Julen Lopetegui's tenure as Wolves boss, but affection from O'Neil and his coaching staff was the catalyst to get him motoring in the Premier League.",
      "\"We were still trying to find the best role for him when we arrived,\" Burchnall said. \"I joined six games into the campaign, but Cunha was superb in the opening game against Man United.",
      "\"I think Gary was playing around a little bit with the system and shape, with Pedro Neto switching sides, and that obviously affected Cunha, so we moved him around a little bit. But we played Manchester City at the end of September and Cunha was magnificent, especially defensively.",
      "\"We settled on a 3-4-3 with Pedro Neto, Hwang Hee-chan and Cunha. Once Matheus started to bed into the left No.10 role, he started to fly. He didn’t get going under Lopetegui, but he started to flourish.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Burchnall continued: \"You can see it straight away with Matheus. His technical capabilities are unbelievable, his finishing is superb and he hits with crazy power. I remember talking to him and he said he didn’t play any formal football until he was 14. He was big on playing futsal.",
      "\"You see how he receives the ball with his sole and manipulates it, it’s futsal-driven. He can kill the ball and go from being stationary to accelerating past people - he does that ridiculously well.\"",
      "Cunha is preparing for the 2025/2026 season as a United player, following a £62.5million move from the West Midlands at the start of July.",
      "\"We had a lot of discussions about how to get the best out of Matheus Cunha because he’s such a fantastic talent,\" admitted Burchnall.",
      "\"If you get the best out of him, there’s a good chance you’re going to win football matches. And a lot of the games we were successful in at Wolves, Matheus had a huge hand in that.",
      "\"We knew he would be important, so we spent a lot of time thinking about how we could get him into the best positions and into space. Gary spent a lot of time one-to-one with Matheus, trying to help get the best out of him.",
      "\"If you look at his career so far, he’s probably had his most consistent period of good performances in a Wolves shirt. We got to where we wanted to be with him and got a lot of him.\"",
      "There were two keys to unlocking the best from Cunha at Wolves: playing him in the left side No.10 role and giving him freedom.",
      "\"I can totally understand why Manchester United would sign him, especially because of the system Ruben Amorim likes to play,\" Burchnall said.",
      "\"He is tailor-made for that left No.10 role, the left forward position in the 3-4-3. It’s the perfect position for him. Sometimes, if we played 4-2-3-1 with a central No. 10 at Wolves, there was a big demand on the defensive role of that position out of possession.",
      "\"With a back five, I think he got more freedom, he could drift in and make a lot things happen. Matheus likes freedom. Too many constraints on training and too much coach-led stuff is not his favourite because he likes to be able to play and express himself in that setting.",
      "\"Of course, you have to work on other bits in training and those are the bits Matheus probably isn’t best at, but as soon as he gets some freedom and the chance to get on the ball, he can do some fantastic stuff.",
      "\"I think trying to understand the human on a deeper level helped get the best out of him. I think that’s something we were really conscious of because we gave him the freedom to be himself.",
      "\"After he signed for Man United, I sent him a text to say congratulations, it’s a fantastic move, and I said just keep being yourself, Matheus, because that’s really important. And he just responded, 'of course, my friend, I’ll keep being myself, but maybe just a little bit better'.",
      "\"The out-of-possession areas were probably where we felt we needed to demand a bit more from Matheus. But there’s always that trade-off where he needs energy for transitions and counter-attacks.",
      "\"We knew sometimes some others would have to do that work to enable him to get on the ball. We were conscious that it was never going to be the biggest part of his game.",
      "\"He isn’t known for that and rightly so, so we had to create a situation where we got him defensively into shape and with enough energy to impact the game when we needed him.\"",
      "Cunha was a priority target for Amorim and he has settled into his new surroundings better than anyone could have hoped for, moving into a house and becoming immediately popular at Carrington",
      "Amorim has praised Cunha's character and outgoing personality. The Brazilian is understood to be popular with staff at Carrington and is naturally closest with fellow Portuguese speakers, Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte in the dressing room.",
      "\"He’s a really nice guy, always smiling and upbeat,\" said Burchnall. \"He’s a character and enjoys football. But you saw it in some moments last season, like against Ipswich, which was our last game, and later down the line against Bournemouth in the FA Cup, he’s an emotional guy.",
      "\"He’s passionate, your typical South American, so he has that side to him as well. He trains and plays on the edge a little bit, but when it’s done and dusted, he’s a nice guy, a family guy and a funny guy, so I’m sure he’s going to have an influence in the dressing room and be a really good guy to have around.\"",
      "Burchnall laughed as he explained Cunha would like to play a game with a reserve goalkeeper in the training session before a match. \"He would like to do certain shooting exercises right at the end of sessions, getting balls served into him to take different shots, and he would take a penalty,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd end by taking a pen and would definitely offer the keeper something if he would save it - and I rarely saw the goalkeeper get near one. I think that was just to keep himself on the edge. There's no pressure in training, so offering the goalkeeper money or a dinner would focus his mind.\"",
      "Cunha was excellent in home and away fixtures against United last season, but his standout performance for Wolves came against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in February 2024.",
      "\"He scored an amazing goal against West Brom in the FA Cup and another against Nottingham Forest,\" Burchnall said. \"He was struggling with a calf injury and was playing through it, to be honest, and he scored an individual goal against Forest away that was just breathtaking.",
      "\"We weren’t sure whether he was going to be fit and available to play - and he scored two goals in that game. But Chelsea away was the standout. Matheus and Rayan Ait-Nouri were brilliant together down that side and some of the things they did were completely off the cuff.",
      "\"We would laugh on the bench and they were superb against Chelsea. We were 4-1 up in that game, Cunha scored a hat-trick, and the two of them were rotating positions, and you could see how much they were enjoying it.",
      "\"Thiago Silva scored a header from a corner to make it 4-2 with a few minutes to go and added time to follow, so it was panic stations. There was a little break and Gary got the players over to pass on tactical information.",
      "\"We couldn't find Cunha, we looked across and he was sat down with his arm around the ball boy, having a chat with him. At the time, we were so stressed, but afterwards we laughed when we watched it back. He was so relaxed and that’s just him. He loves playing and expressing himself.\"",
      "Cunha was linked to other Premier League clubs ahead of the summer transfer window, but he only wanted to sign for United, which Burchnall believes should be a good career decision.",
      "\"There was talk of lots of different clubs being interested,\" he said. \"But Arsenal, for example, use a very different No.10. Martin Odegaard is one of the best No.10s out of possession and can drop deep, but it’s a very different role.",
      "\"I don’t know if Arsenal’s system would have got the best of Cunha because of their set-up, while Amorim has been uncompromising with his system and I think it's very much a tailor-made for him.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake at Old Trafford in February 2024. The British billionaire gained control of football operations and has overseen several controversial decisions.",
      "The decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game in the Premier League last season, with no concessions for children or pensioners, triggered intense backlash from fans.",
      "United suffered their worst campaign for 51 years, finishing 15th in the Premier League, and a handful of protests were organised against the ownership throughout the season.",
      "United supporter group The 1958 announced a fresh protest before facing Arsenal on Sunday, but they have decided to postpone the protest after gauging fan opinion on the issue.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been backed with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon. The mood has improved after an encouraging pre-season, which has contributed to the split in opinion.",
      "Betfair’s annual Nation Predicts survey of more than 2,000 football fans, conducted by YouGov Sport, touched on ownership and 59 per cent of United fans said they were not happy.",
      "The 1958 protest group conducted their own research (with 26,000 responses) and further highlighted how fans are undecided about whether to give Ineos more time to prove themselves.",
      "When The 1958 announced the protest before the opening day of the season would be postponed, they said: \"After careful reflection, and in light of the survey results. We have made the decision to postpone the planned protest for the Arsenal home game on Saturday, August 17th.",
      "\"For us, it has always been, and will always be, about the fans. About how we’re treated by the club and its owners. About protecting the future of Manchester United, affordable football for all (especially youth), safeguarding fan culture, and ensuring the next generation of supporters inherit a club run with responsibility and respect.",
      "\"These long-term goals matter more to us than signings, glittery training ground refurbs or anything else. That’s where we’ve always stood and we make no apologies for it.",
      "\"With a fanbase as diverse and passionate as ours, finding the right balance isn’t always easy. We’ve had to consider momentum, timing, fan appetite, broader consequences of protest activity whilst assessing how current and future decisions may impact us as fans.",
      "\"Given the current sentiment within the fanbase and particularly in light of these recent survey results, it’s clear there is no unified view on the direction of the club under Ratcliffe.",
      "\"That split is real, and we believe it would be irresponsible to risk creating a situation that could result in any “red on red” conflict inside or outside the stadium.\"",

      "Pre-season had not even started and already a debate was ongoing about who might occupy the three centre-back spots for Manchester United's Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "Despite experiencing a torrid campaign last term, the season came to an end with United's centre-back pool in pretty good shape. Luke Shaw started four of the last five Premier League games, Leny Yoro returned for the Europa League final and Ayden Heaven was making rapid progress.",
      "As a result, there was no reason why United would have felt the need to sign a centre-back in this summer's transfer window. Instead, they have prioritised signings at the other end of the pitch this summer.",
      "Scoring goals was United's biggest problem last term, highlighted by their negative goal difference in the Premier League of -10. They will now be hoping the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko will solve that particular issue.",
      "While the aforementioned trio should be guaranteed starters for the Premier League curtain-raiser against the Gunners, there is less certainty about who will be starting in defence.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system means three centre-back spots need filling, but Yoro is the only guaranteed starter. He started four of United's five pre-season friendlies and was excellent during the tour of the United States.",
      "He has nailed down the right-sided centre-back berth and will be one of the very first names on Sunday's teamsheet. However, it is not so easy to predict who will start in the middle of the back-three and on the left.",
      "That is because of the healthy level of competition Amorim has available to him right now. Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are leading contenders to start in the middle, while Shaw and Heaven are squabbling to start on the left.",
      "Maguire and Heaven got the nod against Fiorentina last weekend, but De Ligt and Shaw made more starts in pre-season, getting the nod on three occasions apiece.",
      "All four players will believe they are equally worthy of starting the season opener - and that is a luxury for any coach. Amorim needs strength in depth and competition for places.",
      "De Ligt experienced a mixed debut season at Old Trafford, meaning he will be looking for more consistency this term. Maguire revived his United career last term and will also be of the opinion he should start in the centre.",
      "Heaven, who will no doubt be desperate to start against his former club, has not put a foot wrong since joining United earlier this year and has developed a lot quicker than anyone could have anticipated. Shaw, meanwhile, will be out to make up for lost time after two injury-hit seasons.",
      "Amorim said of Shaws during pre-season: \"I think Luke Shaw is a world-class player, that is my feeling. When he touches the ball, the ability to play one against one and you can feel in the small things.",
      "\"England have reached two finals, and he had issues during the season but in the final he's always there. That means something, but he needs to be fit and train always in the limits.",
      "\"I think he is doing that in the moment, so he is a great player, but he has competition this season, I am really pleased with Luke.\"",
      "Amid United's transition to a wing-back system, Shaw's best chance of becoming a regular at Old Trafford again is by playing at left-sided centre-back. He is excellent at progressing the ball from that area of the pitch to support United's build up play.",
      "However, his injury record is concerning to say the least. But with Lisandro Martinez also on the comeback trail, the England international should benefit from internal competition when he is fit.",
      "Such levels of competition will also be of comfort to Amorim, who will be hoping his players push each other to maintain high standards.",
      "The right-sided centre-back spot has been locked down by Yoro, but the other two positions remain up for grabs, and attempting to predict who will occupy them on Sunday afternoon is impossible.",
      "Only Sunday's teamsheet will provide the answers to this ongoing debate.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been impressed with how dedicated Sesko has been to enhancing his fitness in anticipation of a debut this week.",

      "Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee have both returned to team training and are available for selection on Sunday.",
      "\"Nous and Licha are out, they cannot play this game,\" Amorim said. \"Josh recovered. Andre recovered. They are options for this game. We will see.",
      "\"First of all, we have more than three (attackers), they are fighting for the places. I’m really happy, he (Sesko) has great potential. In everything he does, he can play different type of football, he’s going to feel that Premier League is really aggressive, he is going to learn but he has great potential. I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. That is why we paid so much money, to have a striker to have his history in our club.",
      "\"Of course, we didn’t have a lot of time but he’s ready. Physically, he’s ready, that is a big component in our league. Then he is really smart, every detail he asks, he is a guy who is always thinking. He spent all afternoon here working on his fitness, we will see if he is going to play, going to start.",
      "\"He does the same as the other players. He’s one guy who stays here, has lunch, goes to the medical department, does stretching, he’s always thinking about football, he's really obsessed about that. It’s a good thing. You don't have to think about that aspect with that young guy.",
      "\"I don’t need to tell Ben, 'Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready for every game. It’s like do or die'. With that guy, I don’t have that concern. I have the opposite. Enjoy a little bit!",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, August 16.",
      "The Premier League got back up and running Friday night with Liverpool beating Bournemouth in an eventful 4-2 victory. If that has wet your appetite for the return of competitive football, strap yourself in as you do not have long to wait until the Reds start their campaign against Arsenal.",
      "We shall be previewing the big match today as well as keeping you up to date with the summer transfer window. MEN Sport understands the move for Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline but United are relaxed about the situation and are happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "In the meantime, thoughts turn to who could be United's alternative this summer. Sporting Lisbon's captain Morten Hjulmand is a player familiar to Ruben Amorim and is thought to be on the radar.",
      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is a player that the Reds also admire with some claiming the long-term plan is to play the Englishman alongside Baleba in the future. There is also the small matter of sales to discuss too with Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all expected to depart before the window closes.",
      "Keep across all the latest United news, views and transfer rumours below...",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano has suggested that United made club-to-club contact with Brighton for the signing of Baleba.",
      "It is claimed that United, as reported by MEN Sport, were told by Brighton that Baleba is not for sale.",
      "Baleba has not told Brighton that he wants to leave but would be interested in joining the Reds if an agreement can be reached between the clubs.",
      "Ahead of the new Premier League campaign, Betfair and YouGov have polled 2,000 football fans on their thoughts for the new season.",
      "United supporters have been deemed the least confident in terms of the 'Big Six' clubs.",
      "43 per cent of the Reds' fanbase think the club will end the campaign trophyless once again.",
      "According to The Sun, United are now in the midst of preparing a £50m transfer approach for Morten Hjulmand.",
      "They claimed this week that should a move for Baleba prove impossible, attention would turn to the Danish international.",
      "Hjulmand is thought to have a £68m release clause but Sporting could look to sell him for £10m less including add-ons.",
      "That being said, it seems United could be a tad short of the Lisbon club's asking price.",
      "In case you missed it yesterday, MEN Sport understands that a move for Baleba before the window closes is unlikely.",
      "United remain fans of the midfielder but are too far away on his price tag.",
      "The Reds are willing to wait until next year to complete the deal though.",

      "The Reds' captain said via O Jogo: \"I know that numbers are the most important thing in football, and obviously, the figure the club was going to get for me was a big one. So, I know it was difficult for the club.",
      "\"I only spoke to the Al Hilal president once and told him I never thought about leaving. Whatever he wanted to do or not, he should discuss it with the club. I always said that if the club wanted to sell, then yes, they would have to make a decision.",
      "\"If they didn't want to, there's nothing to decide because my goal was to stay. It's a lot of money for me too, but that's how it is. People make decisions. I know I won't regret it because I'm where I want to be.\"",

      "Despite the midfielder being keen on a move, United won't be able to get anywhere near the price it would take for Brighton to enter any serious discussions.",
      "It would therefore be a waste of time to make bids that both club know will be rejected instantly.",
      "This way, United can quickly turn their concentration to new targets, and maybe keep Baleba in mind for future windows when Brighton may be more willing to do buinsess.",

      "\"I can't claim to have an incredible knowledge on EVERY player so I must admit I have seen less of United's new striker Benjamin Sesko, but he seems a player with a lot of potential and his arrival surely spells the end for Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Arsenal have a new centre-forward too of course, and United boss Ruben Amorim knows all about Viktor Gyokeres after their time together at Sporting.",
      "\"I am looking forward to seeing how Gyokeres links up with the likes of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, and how quickly they can develop an understanding.",
      "\"Add in how there is always needle in this match, and that a win would be huge for either side, and there is a lot to look forward to.",
      "\"It is going to be close, but although I feel really positive about United this season, I think they will lose this and Gyokeres may just have the final say against his old manager.\"",

      "\"Mikel Arteta and Arsenal must forget about the 37 games they have coming up after this weekend. This is the problem with some people in this league, you should never go into a new season with a mindset of making up points later. Look at Jose Mourinho when he was successful at Chelsea, he always got off the block quickly. It's true that you can't win the league in October, but you can surely lose it if you're not sharp enough.\"",

      "Robin van Persie declined to take sides when asked to choose between former employers Manchester United and Arsenal. The player made a contentious move from the Emirates to Old Trafford in 2012 and was dubbed a traitor by certain sects of the Gunners faithful.",
      "Van Persie's old teams are set to clash on Sunday as the Red Devils kick off their Premier League campaign hosting last year's runners-up. Ruben Amorim's squad will be eager to demonstrate they're not easy targets following a disappointing 15th-place finish, while Mikel Arteta's men are setting their sights on the title after finishing second in each of the last three seasons.",
      "Despite having controversially worn the jerseys of both English giants, Van Persie declined to declare his allegiance to either side when questioned about his preferences in March. In an interview with ESPN (via The Mirror) at the start of the year, the Dutchman was asked whom he preferred out of former team-mates Wayne Rooney or Thierry Henry.",
      "His response was simply: \"Pass, because they're both so different and very good.\" When pressed to choose between legendary managers Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson, he gave a similar answer.",
      "\"Definitely both,\" came his reply, giving the same diplomatic response when asked to pick between the clubs themselves. His indecisiveness even extended to the clubs' respective rivals, Manchester City and Tottenham, with the ex-striker expressing frustration before completely avoiding a question about them.",
      "The Dutchman, who is now managing Feyenoord, scored 132 goals in 278 matches for Arsenal before his controversial move to United, where he secured the Premier League crown in his debut season. Despite the furore surrounding his transfer, Wenger revealed Van Persie had voiced his wish to return to north London, but it simply wasn't feasible.",
      "Discussing their bond, Wenger said: \"In 2012, he announced his intention not to extend his contract. All the big clubs were courting him. I sold him to Manchester United.",
      "\"The supporters were angry with me for this, but we could not match the offer. I managed to negotiate his departure for £24million, which was a huge amount at the time for a player with a year left on his contract. I had only the interest of the club in mind.",
      "\"My relationship with Alex Ferguson and Manchester United had improved by then, but every transfer is a polite game of poker where you attempt to give not anything away. Van Persie had a fantastic first six months at Old Trafford: he put the team on track for the Premiership title and made it even more difficult for us.\"",
      "Van Persie proved similarly prolific in Manchester, where he scored 58 times in only 105 games. And despite spending half as long at United, he won just as many major trophies there as he did in his eight years with Arsenal.",
      "It's a testament to Ferguson's recruitment strike rate and ability to know precisely what his teams were lacking. However, every player reaches a point in their career when they can no longer make the cut at the necessary level.",
      "Wenger went on to reveal Van Persie's efforts to make it back to the capital as he continued: \"After three years of the four that he signed for, he was injured, and [Louis] Van Gaal sold him to the Turkish club, Fenerbahce. He called me because he wanted to come back, but it was impossible: he was at the end of his career and we were investing in young players.\"",

      "After establishing himself amongst the Premier League's elite following a three-year spell at Barcelona, where he claimed every major honour except the Champions League, then-United manager Jose Mourinho came knocking in 2018.",
      "In an unusual transfer arrangement, United and Arsenal, who meet on Sunday in their opening Premier League fixture of the campaign, agreed to complete an exchange deal, with Sanchez heading to Manchester whilst Henrikh Mkhitaryan travelled in the reverse direction during January 2018.",
      "Before the transfer was finalised, Sanchez had found the net seven times in 19 league outings, a comparatively sluggish beginning for the winger, considering he had struck 24 goals the previous campaign.",
      "In a catastrophic decline in performance, Sanchez managed just two additional league strikes for the remainder of the season. He concluded his opening six months as a Red Devil with three goals across 18 matches in all competitions, reports the Mirror.",
      "Speaking in 2020, Sanchez acknowledged he was initially optimistic about joining United but those feelings were quickly extinguished after merely one training session.",
      "\"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting, and it was something good for me,\" he said. \"I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually, I signed, but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.",
      "\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things. After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'",
      "\"They laughed. I told them there was something that didn't sit right, it didn't seem good. But I had already signed; I was already there. After the first few months, I carried on having the same feeling. We weren't united as a team in that moment.\"",
      "Sanchez's second campaign at United, which proved to be his final one, was considerably more disappointing than his inaugural season. He netted merely one league goal across 20 appearances and found himself relegated to substitute duties for the majority of the term.",
      "Following his omission from the travelling squad for an away fixture against West Ham, Sanchez revealed that Mourinho's choice to sideline him severely damaged his self-belief.",
      "\"In a game with West Ham, I wasn't picked,\" Sanchez continued. \"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me, and I said it couldn't be possible. To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house, and I was very sad. The next day, I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\"",
      "United bosses decided to end the unsuccessful venture, loaning Sanchez to Inter Milan in 2019 before he made a permanent move the following year. He later played for Marseille before making a brief return to Inter in 2023. He then secured a move back to Udinese, his first European club after departing from his home country.",

      "Ruben Amorim spoke to journalists on Friday ahead of Manchester United's game against Arsenal.",
      "The misery of last season is firmly in the rear-view mirror at Old Trafford and Amorim is hoping to oversee major improvement in 2025/2026 after an encouraging pre-season this summer.",
      "Amorim has been backed with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon, and Sesko could make his debut against Arsenal this weekend.",
      "Arsenal are looking to mount another Premier League title challenge and will pose a huge test for United on the opening day of the campaign. The Gunners drew 1-1 with United when they played at Old Trafford in March.",
      "Recap what Amorim said in the press conference here.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is ready to start for United in their opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal.",
      "Sesko arrived in Manchester last Thursday and completed his £74million transfer from RB Leipzig on Saturday. The 22-year-old had his first training session with his new teammates on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been impressed with how dedicated Sesko has been to enhancing his fitness in anticipation of a debut this week.",
      "United will be without Lisandro Martinez, who is still recovering from rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament, and Noussair Mazraoui, whose only appearance during pre-season was in the first friendly against Leeds United in Stockholm.",
      "Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee have both returned to team training and are available for selection on Sunday.",
      "\"Nous and Licha are out, they cannot play this game,\" Amorim said. \"Josh recovered. Andre recovered. They are options for this game. We will see.\"",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Stay tuned on the blog for reaction from Amorim's press conference at Carrington.",
      "\"I'm really happy with our players, they are working really well and we have players in that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players.\"",
      "\"He's one more option. We will see. We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",
      "\"First of all, we have more than three [Cunha, Mbeumo, Sesko], so they are fighting for their places, but I'm really happy. I think he has great potential. In everything he does, he can play different types of football, he will feel the Premier League is very aggressive, he is going to learn and he has great potential.\"",
      "\"I really like that, especially when it's smart questions. He listens and he wants to perform, so that is very good.\"",
      "\"Even last season, when he played as a midfielder, he was the player who had more shots near the box. So I think it's a good thing for Bruno to stay in one position during training. I want Bruno near the ball, which is really important for our team. Now we have players with different characteristics who can cope with that, so we will try to manage the game by game, the players for the best positions.\"",
      "\"I learned a lot last season. I don't need to focus on the future. That doesn't matter and I don't care. I need to live day by day. Everything that is noise to our team, I take out of the picture, so I just prepare my team against Arsenal.\"",
      "\"Maybe Mason Mount is a player who can play in that position if we want something different. But we have players to cope and win games in the Premier League.\"",
      "\"That is a question for Mikel [Arteta]. Viktor is in a different league. Sporting have good scouting because they live from the players they can buy and sell to survive. I think he's a very good player. It's not a surprise to see him with a big club in England.\"",
      "\"We want to return to Europe. We have to be realistic with our fans. We will have to fight a lot because there are more teams with time together than us. We have to focus game by game. We want to win against Arsenal.\"",
      "\"It's hard to know. We cannot change everything in four weeks, but we are better. We are training harder and are more prepared to cope with the demands of the game. I'm really more confident, that is clear. Step by step, we will be a better team.\"",
      "\"I can see Ben being a striker atthis club for many years. That is why we paid a lot of money. He didn't have a lot of time [training], but physically he is ready. That is a big component in our league. He's ready to play and we'll see if he starts.\"",
      "\"No, Licha and Mazraoui are out, they cannot play this game. Josh [Zirkzee] and Andre [Onana] are recovering and are options. We'll see.\"",

      "Chelsea paid a £5million penalty fee to break their obligation to sign Sancho. The winger has been looking for a new club and Roma have contacted United to discuss the terms of a loan, with an obligation included.",

      "Adam Wharton could have saved his grandparents a lot of worry by signing for Manchester United, and a deal back in 2024 would have ultimately saved Old Trafford chiefs a lot of money – but it was Crystal Palace who ultimately took the plunge in a £22m swoop.",
      "Now, 18 months on, the Eagles value the 21-year-old significantly higher. His asking price could now be as much as £60m, which may well put the Red Devils off making a move for the England international. Wharton's value has skyrocketed quickly in his young career, after impressing Premier League sides with his skills at Blackburn Rovers as a youth project.",
      "The playmaker spent his entire youth career with the Championship side, before making 44 appearances for their first team and contributing four goals from the centre of the pitch. Last year, The Guardian reported that United scouts were among those to have watched Wharton at Ewood Park.",
      "While Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both showed interest as well, it was Palace who took the shot on the young star in a deal worth up to £22m. With 36 Premier League appearances already under his belt – plus the FA Cup and Community Shield – Wharton has been impressive for both club and country.",
      "The 21-year-old was also selected by the England senior team to participate in Euro 2024, after only making his international debut for the Three Lions just days before the tournament in June.",
      "This means that United could have potentially saved around £40m had they decided to sign Wharton back in 2024 instead. A move to the north west would have also benefited his family life, as his father revealed last year that his grandmothers were \"worried sick\" for him moving to south London to play for Palace – although dad John claims he hasn't looked back since the move.",
      "The Englishman is one of two players that Ruben Amorim is considering bringing to his midfield this summer, with Carlos Baleba the more prominent option.",
      "United, though, ultimately face having made the same mistake with the Brighton star, as he was available for just £23m back in 2023.",
      "While playing for Lille, the 21-year-old was subject to interest from the Old Trafford outfit, but the Seagulls signed him on a five-year deal instead. Now, the Premier League side value Baleba at a whopping £104m – meaning Amorim's team would be slapping £81m more on the table than they should be if they take the swoop on the Cameroonian.",
      "With Wharton as an alternative, fans would be hoping that this transfer could be slightly easier to conduct; but this isn't the case. The sale of the England midfielder may all rest on Palace's ability to retain other star players in their squad, namely Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "Liverpool have expressed a keen interest in tempting Guehi away from the team he captains, launching a bid worth up to £35m. While the Eagles are not planning on letting the star leave, the 25-year-old will come to the end of his contract next summer. Guehi, though, is prepared to see out his contract.",
      "Eze is also attracting moths to the flame this summer, with both north London sides interested in signing the classy midfielder.",
      "Arsenal and Spurs are potentially planning to wait out the England international's £68m release clause, which will expire at the end of this week.",
      "Wharton's move may depend entirely on whether either one or both of his team-mates move on to pastures new.",
      "With Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all in the building ahead of United's clash with the Gunners on Sunday, Amorim is keen to get his project on the go at Old Trafford.",
      "Discussing his \"selection headache\" ahead of the Premier League opener earlier this week, the boss told MUTV: \"That [a selection headache] is a good thing, it is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "\"It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.\"",

      "While this may seem like a blow, there is a belief that Baleba would be interested in moving to Old Trafford when the opportunity arises.",
      "Backing up our understanding, The Telegraph reported this week that Brighton value Baleba at more than £100m. The Seagulls will undoubtedly be coming to this conclusion due to the then English transfer record fee Chelsea paid for Moises Caicedo.",
      "Such a figure will be out of United's budget, you would imagine. It also adds up with Brighton's stance that they do not want to sell Baleba in this window.",
      "Perhaps adding more weight to Baleba staying on the south coast this window, his manager Fabian Hurzeler has been speaking about the chances of his midfielder leaving. He responded in his press conference: \"I am very, very confident Baleba will stay with us.\"",

      "Manchester United have strengthened Ruben Amorim's squad in the summer transfer window, but there is an area that hasn't been addressed ahead of the opening game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "You don't win any prizes for guessing it's the midfield. United have signed a striker, two forwards for the No.10 roles and a left-back, but have not secured a fresh face for the engine room.",
      "That has the potential to be problematic and immediately exposed against Arsenal, who have two of the Premier League's finest midfielders, Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard, alongside new addition Martín Zubimendi.",
      "There is positivity at Old Trafford ahead of the new campaign and United deserve huge credit for their business so far, but it's impossible to shake a feeling that they need a new midfielder through the door.",
      "Amorim plays with two midfielders in the pivot and his current options have not complemented each other as was hoped. Bruno Fernandes has been used in the pivot, but is playing Fernandes alongside Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo or Casemiro a sustainable option to secure results?",
      "It says a lot about Ugarte that United already need a new player of his ilk, just 12 months after signing him from Paris Saint-Germain. Ugarte's performances have been mixed and he hasn't truly nailed down the role.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, which represented a significant outlay, but United are planning to invest in his position again.",

      "Arsenal have quality in the centre of the pitch and will be hopeful of winning the midfield battle. And as a result, that could highlight and emphasise how much United need to sign a new midfielder this summer.",
      "The same thing essentially happened after the first two games of the 2022/2023 season. United lost 2-1 to Brighton and were hammered 4-0 by Brentford, which forced them into action in the transfer market.",
      "The midfield was ruthlessly exploited in those games and Casemiro arrived to provide defensive cover. United are very unlikely to have such a bad start this season, but Arsenal could highlight the chasm with midfield options.",
      "Amorim would obviously prefer to secure a victory rather than to oversee the kind of defeat that would send a message to the board about needing to sign a new midfielder, though.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford will be tremendous on the opening day of the campaign against a historic rival, which means United might be spurred to a victory, even with doubts about their midfield.",
      "However, Amorim needs a new midfielder to be successful this season and he appeared to warn that he needs a new signing when he spoke after the final pre-season friendly last weekend.",
      "Speaking to MUTV, Amorim said: \"I think it was a perfect game for preparation to show us we need to improve in different areas that we are going to struggle in some moments. But sometimes we have players who can make a play and elevate the stadium.\"",
      "It felt obvious that Amorim was referring to the midfield with that answer.",

      "The 21-year-old has emerged as a target for United this summer, with reports elsewhere suggesting that the Reds are in constant talks with Baleba's camp over his future. It is claimed that United are weighing up whether personal terms for the midfielder would be viable before launching their first bid.",
      "Baleba is understood to be open to the prospect of signing for United, even without Champions League football this term. However, the true test will be to reach an agreement with the Seagulls for his departure.",
      "Brighton are believed to be adamant that Baleba is not for sale this summer. Fabian Hurzeler has already lost Joao Pedro and Pervis Estupinan and the consensus is that the club have shut up shop for outgoings.",
      "However, this does not seem to have deterred United from testing the waters on Baleba. In his Premier League predictions for this season, Sherwood backed the Cameroonian to be the young player of the season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Explaining his decision, he also made a confident transfer prediction for the central midfielder. \"He had a great second season for Brighton, and he will get better and probably move to a 'bigger' club,\" Sherwood said.",
      "Should Baleba not sign, Sherwood's fellow pundit Matt Holland believes the Reds already have a young midfielder who could light up the Premier League.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Fulham\nFulham appear to have forgotten how to sign players but they have got around to making a ‘tentative enquiry’ for the Man Utd striker. The Cottagers are likely to have a hole in their attack and cash burning a hole in their pocket amounting to what United might demand for Hojlund. But you would expect the ex-Atalanta striker to favour loan interest from Italy.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Crystal Palace\nElliott has already endeared himself to the Selhurst Park faithful by missing a penalty in Liverpool’s Community Shield shootout defeat to Palace. This one is only likely if Eberechi Eze leaves.",
      "",
      "17) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed.",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "",
      "16) Morten Hjulmand – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nIf Brighton refuse to sell Baleba – we expect they will for what United are willing to pay – then Hjulmand is next on their list, apparently. The Dane has worked with Ruben Amorim and knows his system but links with United pre-date the manager’s appointment at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old would be available for around half the price Brighton expect for Baleba.",
      "",
      "15) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have made a breakthrough with one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nThe story that refuses to go away. Will it finally happen this month?",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "MORE ON EZE: Four real and compelling reasons why Eberechi Eze might choose Spurs over Arsenal",
      "",
      "11) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",

      "10) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs are close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "9) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days and Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho, but a move to Roma is now looking likely. The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old. That being true, United should be snapping their hand off.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Omari Hutchinson – Ipswich to Nottingham Forest\nA club-record £37.5m deal has been agreed. Big money. Big pressure.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Nottingham Forest\nBlimey. Forest are moving mad now that their Europa League spot has been confirmed. £26m for Kalimuendo is good business. £37.5m for Hutchinson is…interesting business.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nForest have won the race for McAtee, who had attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. A deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons was agreed and Ramsey flew to Tyneside for a medical on Thursday evening."

      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "Here are five things we can’t believe happened only a year ago…",
      "",
      "Scott McTominay replacing Kobbie Mainoo\nMainoo wasn’t quite ‘untouchable’ as he started at the base of Manchester United’s midfield in their opener against Fulham last season. Amid interest from Chelsea and financial constraints which were resulting in mass redundancies under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, no-one was. But he was The Future to a greater degree than the other two members of the trident of hope: Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "He still is in so far as Garnacho is the living, breathing antithesis of what Ruben Amorim wants to create at Old Trafford as the most unwelcome member of the current bomb squad, while Hojlund remains the ghost of the feast. But Mainoo, having been a beacon of light under Erik ten Hag after scoring in the FA Cup final and playing a major role for England at the Euros, now enters a season knowing any football he plays will be out of position under Amorim, who is currently desperate to source a new midfield destroyer who we suspect will limit Mainoo’s game time to such a degree that he will be pushing for the exit come January.",
      "McTominay meanwhile, having been either the midfield bridesmaid at United – as illustrated by his six-minute cameo against Fulham a year ago – or one half of the widely deplored McFred axis, heads into his second season with Napoli as the Scudetto winner and Serie A’s Most Valuable Player, given the freedom of a city in which the love bestowed upon him has rarely, if ever, been trumped since the deification of the arguably the greatest footballer to ever play the game, Diego Maradona.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho assist for Joshua Zirkzee winner\n“What a big moment for Joshua Zirkzee,” said Gary Neville on commentary, after the £36.5m summer signing came off the bench to score the winner two minutes from time at Old Trafford. We all assumed that was the first of many after that introduction to Premier League football.",
      "There was discussion after that game as to whether it was a “smart finish” or something closer to a lucky scuff, and there’s little doubt that the thousands of Manchester United fans who jeered Zirkzee off against Newcastle just over four months later plumped for the latter in hindsight.",
      "He scored just two further goals in the remaining 31 games of his debut Premier League season, combining with Hojlund’s goalscoring woes to force United into spending £74m on a Benjamin Sesko this summer, with Zirkzee’s game time surely set to be further limited by the arrivals of Matheus Cuha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It was Garnacho who came off the bench to provide the assist, having done his typical busy dribbling thing to get Ten Hag’s side back into the game and give the cartel of United pundits plenty of ammo to claim ‘this will be his season’, while the hackneyed insistence that Marcus Rashford ‘isn’t a kid anymore and needs to lead this team’ was also rolled out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha on the bench\nIt says a fair bit about the management of Gary O’Neil that he opted for a three of Hwang Hee-chan, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Rodrigo Gomes – a right-back he fielded on the left wing – to operate behind Jorgen Strand-Larsen against Arsenal while Cunha sat on the bench for the first hour.",
      "The Brazilian who would go on to smash their club-record departure by moving to Manchester United for £62.5m at the end of a season in which he would score 15 Premier League goals. Hwang, Bellegarde and Gomes got six between them. It would make more sense if Cunha has been a bit sh*t the season before, but he also finished that campaign as top scorer with 12.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko starts\nHaving been one of Arsenal’s key players in his first season after arriving from Manchester City, Zinchenko should perhaps have seen the writing on the wall by the time his third season rolled around after the second ended with Mikel Arteta preferring to field Takehiro Tomiyasu out of position at left-back over the Ukrainian.",
      "The £42m spent on Calafiori and the return to fitness of Jurrien Timber will only have added to those fears, though those concerns will have been assuaged greatly by him being named in the starting XI to face Wolves on the opening day. But that was just one of five Premier League starts, and three of those were at the back end of the season when Premier League title hopes were lost and focus had shifted to the Champions League, with the stratospheric rise of young upstart Myles Lewis-Skelly doing nothing to improve his standing and mood at the club.",
      "And you get the sense that he doesn’t really know why he’s been sidelined – like he’s been ghosted by a lover whom he talked to about building a life together – as indicated by quite the harrowing excerpt from his recent autobiography.",
      "“In pure personal terms, it was easily the worst season I ever experienced as a professional. A player who doesn’t play is nothing. Imagine this little boy who’s dedicated his entire existence to becoming good at one particular thing and then finds at 28 that he’s essentially no longer needed, that there are others who can do the job for him. It’s not a nice feeling.”",
      "",
      "Jarell Quansah as Virgil van Dijk’s partner\nQuansah must have wondered while sitting on the bench for all but three of Liverpool’s remaining 37 Premier League games after the curtain-raiser at Ipswich just what Arne Slot had seen from him in that opening 45 minutes before he was hooked for Ibrahima Konate that caused the Liverpool boss to strip him of his badge as Van Dijk’s centre-back partner and hand it to the Frenchman.",
      "Liam Delap had made life difficult for him, but that proved to be a theme for Ipswich’s opponents throughout the season. They hadn’t conceded. It felt almost cruel at the time, but then, Slot will point to the title and the excellent defensive partnership which was crucial to that and shrug his shoulders.",
      "We would suggest that the thought of Quansah playing under Ten Hag in a year’s time as he walked out at Portman Road would have been met with open mouths and giggles, but then there can’t have been more than a dozen people thinking the Dutch manager would still be in charge of Manchester United at the start of this season.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’.",
      "Are Newcastle fans deluded if they think they can keep Alexander Isak? And without him, have Liverpool actually strengthened at all?",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Newcastle are the Alexander Isak of the Premier League, with their transfer window amounting to a two-month sulk having not got their way."

      "",
      "20) Fulham\nThey’ve signed a back-up goalkeeper. That’s the summer. The only flicker of intrigue is the potential signing of a Brazilian called Kevin, which is as amusing as it is genuinely exciting.",
      "",
      "19) West Ham\nGraham Potter’s a top coach, but his first few months have been flat. Jarrod Bowen, an in-form Lucas Paqueta, and the occasional James Ward-Prowse free-kick are the only real reasons to tune in this campaign.",
      "",
      "18) Burnley\nTheir 100-point promotion was built on defence, and Scott Parker looks set to keep it that way. It might be smart, but it won’t be fun.",
      "",
      "17) Wolves\nMatheus Cunha was the one player worth watching. He’s gone. Unless Jhon Arias takes the league by storm, expect some dull viewing.",
      "",
      "16) Brentford\nThomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and (pretty much) Yoane Wissa have all gone. There’s still some talent here, but with rookie boss Keith Andrews in charge, survival looks tougher than entertainment.",
      "But the tough season people are expecting makes them one of the biggest talking points going into the opening weekend.",
      "",
      "15) Aston Villa\nMinimal changes this summer. Yawn. Unai Emery’s still brilliant, but the squad feels a bit samey compared to last year.",
      "",
      "14) Nottingham Forest\nLots of new signings, all attack-minded. Big fees for James McAtee and Omari Hutchinson add intrigue. I’m excited to see them, just less so than the teams above.",
      "",
      "13) Crystal Palace\nWithout Eberechi Eze, they lose some sparkle. Oliver Glasner’s style should keep them watchable, but the drop-off in quality will be obvious if he leaves.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nDefence has been gutted, attack remains strong. Andoni Iraola should still serve up entertaining football, though perhaps in the same way that Blackpool did under Ian Holloway in 2010/11.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nLeeds are back, and that’s always fun. They’re back where they belong, people.",
      "Their signings haven’t necessarily been exciting, but they’ve been very smart and point to a more controlled, well-rounded Whites team this time around. We could get some delicious managerial drama as well, with Leeds reportedly considering sacking Daniel Farke at the end of 2024/25, despite leading them to the Championship title. A poor start could see the Elland Road bosses act…",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United\nA grim summer in the transfer market, but still a squad full of players worth watching — Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Lewis Hall. Results might dip, but entertainment shouldn’t. Even without Alexander Isak, Newcastle are a good team.",
      "",
      "9) Everton\nDavid Moyes with Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye could be box-office. Throw in Tyler Dibling and I’m becoming a fully-fledged Evertonian.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland\nA proper Barclays club returns, with a new face for the top flight in Regis Le Bris and a busy summer. Granit Xhaka might provide us with a lovely meltdown if Sunderland struggle. And lots of young players from foreign leagues are in, which is becoming the norm for a promoted club’s summer window. Not necessarily to great success.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal\nBig summer signings, big expectations. Viktor Gyokeres could be a hit or a disaster. Martin Zubimendi looks superb. Just hope Arsenal don’t go full set-piece robots again, otherwise they’ll plummet down to 20th here.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham Hotspur\nIf the Super Cup is any clue, they’ll attack big games the right way by not being completely gung-ho, while finally looking dangerous from set-pieces. Ange Postecoglou refused to work on the latter and was too proud to move away from the former.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton\nTalented squad, promising coach, attractive football. They should be right in the mix for a top-five finish. Yes, that’s right. I’m going big on Brighton this season.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea\nCole Palmer is reason enough to watch, but there’s quality and flair all over the pitch. Estevao might make us forget Neymar never played in the Premier League. Joao Pedro looks f***ing brilliant. And as always, there are plenty of new faces around the place. The Blues are expected to challenge for the title this time around…",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United\nUnpredictable and capable of glorious chaos. Could be great, could be a mess, often in the same match. That’s why we love them. Kind of.",
      "Bring on a front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, though, with Bruno Fernandes pulling the strings behind them. Yum.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City\nRayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders are exciting additions. Pep Guardiola’s side already play some of the best football in the world, and these signings should make them even more entertaining. You’ve got to love a flying, skillful full-back, and Ait-Nouri is just that, while his arrival hints towards a change in style from natural centre-backs in left-back. And with natural midfielder Matheus Nunes on the other side? City should be attack, attack, attack, with Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush up front to combine for 50 league goals.",
      "",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

      "“But that is a worry, 13 for a whole season, that would be a worry for me… what if he [Sesko] got 10 goals [in the Premier League]? What if he got 10? Because you just turned your nose up at me when I mentioned Gyökeres and 10 [goals], and now you’re thinking about Šeško and 10 [goals].”",

      "",
      "19) Paco Alcacer (Emirates Club)\nThe former Spain attacker has been in the UAE for the last three years, most recently at Sharjah FC on loan. Which is normally the precursor to retirement but at 31, maybe there’s life in the old dog yet.",
      "",
      "18) Yvon Mvogo (Lorient)\nThe 31-year-old goalkeeper, who claims to have turned down Manchester United a year ago, played for Switzerland as recently as March. Anyone need a free-and-easy no.2?",
      "",
      "17) Rick Karsdorp (PSV)\nThe Eredivisie club didn’t take their option to extend his deal so the former Netherlands defender is on the hunt for a new club after 300 appearances for PSV, Roma and Feyenoord.",
      "",
      "16) Lucas Vazquez (Real Madrid)\nAnyone fancying the Real legend will have to be quick as Espanyol are said to be keen to bring him back to the club where he spent a loan season in 2014.",
      "",
      "15) Daler Kuzyaev (Le Harve)\nThe 51-cap Russia midfielder left Le Harve at the end of last season after two season in Ligue 1.",
      "",
      "14) Grady Diangana (West Brom)\nThe winger left West Brom after six years at The Hawthorns. It was thought there would be Championship interest in the 27-year-old while Saudi might also be an option.",

      "8) Josh Dasilva (Brentford)\nStill recovering from a significant knee injury; he will continue his rehab at the club.",

      "",
      "6) Danny Ings (West Ham)\nThere have been strong links with Wrexham but he looks good in claret and blue, and Burnley need a striker.",
      "",
      "5) Abdoulaye Doucoure (Everton)\nAfter five years at Goodison Park, Doucoure has left and will not represent Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.",

      "1) Takehiro Tomiyasu (Arsenal)\n“Unfortunately, injuries have limited Tomi’s time on the pitch in the past two seasons, with the defender making just one substitute appearance last season. It was therefore mutually agreed to end Tomi’s contract in order for him to start a new chapter in his career,” said Arsenal. His ongoing knee injury means he could be on this list for a while.",

      "The agent of a Manchester United new boy has detailed how his “wish” for years was to join the Red Devils, while Wayne Rooney feels the move is the best deal done all summer.",
      "United have made four signings so far this summer. They’ve got young Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon through the door, as well as Premier League attackers Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko featured on Arsenal’s radar for some time. There was a toss-up between him and Viktor Gyokeres, and the Gunners opted to sign the Sporting CP striker, which left United able to land Sesko.",
      "But according to the striker’s agent, that was the move he wanted, anyway.",
      "He said: “What’s important here is that Benjamin’s wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.”",
      "United legend Rooney thinks that deal was a fantastic one for the Red Devils.",
      "Asked on his BBC Sport show who has got the “best deal” of all of the Premier League’s big signings this summer, he suggested it was Sesko’s move to United.",
      "Rooney said: “Do you know what? I really like Sesko. I think he’s going to be top,” he said.",
      "“I do. I like him, I think, because all his attributes. He’s big, he can head the ball, he’s strong, he’s quick, he can use both feet.",
      "“But going into Manchester United is different than going anywhere and there’s a big pressure.”",
      "United fans have not had a look at Sesko in pre-season, as the striker joined too close to their final match of the summer, against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "But after 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, the Red Devils will expect at least a better return than they got from strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee last term.",
      "In the Premier League, with both men featuring in more than 30 games each, neither managed to get past five goals.",
      "The pressure that Rooney speaks of clearly told on the aforementioned pair, both of whom signed for United quite young, in the past couple of seasons.",
      "Sesko is only 22, so he could feel the pressure in the same way if he does not start the season well.",
      "Arsenal legend Ian Wright has stated that Viktor Gyokeres is “another level” to Benjamin Sesko, with the Manchester United new boy’s previous returns a “worry.”",
      "Wirtz’s bow, the start of Chelsea’s title challenge and Sesko v Gyokeres before calls for Arteta’s sacking. The Premier League is back and we could not be more giddy…",

      "Antony has recently been given an ultimatum by Manchester United, but is now said to be open to a shock new commitment which could help all parties.",
      "Antony spent the second half of last season out on loan with Real Betis. He immediately looked at home, and finished his spell there with nine goals and five assists in all competitions.",
      "It’s known that both he and the Spanish club want to reunite if possible, but so far, Betis have looked unable to drum up the required funds for the move for the United man.",
      "That issue could be taken off the table soon, though. According to Estadio Deportivo, one of the options being considered to ‘unblock the situation’ is a new deal being offered to the winger at Old Trafford.",
      "That is an option Antony is said to view ‘more favourably’ than in recent weeks.",
      "That is as it could open the door for a loan move which would be good for all parties. Antony will not want to be tied down to then sit on the bench, but this avenue should be good for him.",
      "If he was to go on loan in his current circumstances, with his contract ending in 2027, he’d have just a year left on his deal at the end of that, and United would either get a small fee, or Antony could see out the final year and leave for free.",
      "If he extends his deal, the Red Devils will surely be happier allowing him to go out on loan again, knowing there’s still a good chance of them receiving a fee in the future, particularly if Antony plays well.",
      "For Betis, a loan seems the best course of action as they don’t have to drum up cash for the winger, but they’ll be able to get him back on a short-term deal, potentially to pick up where he left off last term.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the week that Antony had been told he needs to accept an exit by the end of the week or the threat of him being sidelined until January looms.",
      "That would have been a huge shame for the forward in relation to his World Cup chances. He was in the latest Brazil squad off the back of his Betis performances, getting back into international contention for the first time since 2023.",
      "Continuing to play well at Betis would have given him the chance to stay in contention for Brazil and potentially to play in the World Cup.",
      "That gives the forward another reason to accept a contract offer, if he’s allowed a loan beyond that.",
      "Antony is angling for a return to Real Betis but his actions have reportedly not pleased the Man Utd hierarchy.",

      "The 2025 summer transfer window is in full swing and there are a whole raft of deals agreed. This list will change roughly a trillion times over the coming weeks.",
      "If you want a full list of just Premier League transfers then this is your link.",
      "Players are ranked by size of the initial fee, with add-ons stated.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "10) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "13) Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain) – £54.3m rising to £57m with add-ons\nBournemouth held firm for as long as they could but were only able to resist the European champions for so long before making their third sale of a defender for at least £40m this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "15) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",
      "16) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nChelsea didn’t have enough forwards already.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nThere was an actual petition launched against the signing of Madueke, who might well have come in handy last season when it turned out Raheem Sterling was no Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "18) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",
      "",
      "19) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool to Al Hilal) – £45.9m plus undisclosed add-ons\nLiverpool might have just received the extra funds needed to sign Alexander Isak…",
      "",
      "20) Alvaro Carreras (Benfica to Real Madrid) – £43m\nFive years after leaving Real Madrid for free, the Spanish full-back is returning to the capital for a hefty fee.",

      "The cash-strapped Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already spent £200m on a whole new front three for Ruben Amorim and is currently searching sofa crevices for an extra wad in order to sign him a new goalkeeper and central midfielder.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma makes an awful lot of sense to replace Andre Onana as No.1 and won’t cost the world, but while we can absolutely see why Amorim has pinpointed Carlos Baleba as his ‘perfect’ midfielder, reports suggest the Red Devils aren’t able to drum up the £100m-plus required to sign him from Brighton this summer.",
      "They absolutely need a midfielder in a similar mould though, and as luck would have it, the great guys at FBRef have a very nifty list of 10 players from across Europe’s top five leagues who have similar characteristics to Baleba. Namely being an aggressive, tough-tackling midfielder who can go past opponents with the ball at his feet.",
      "",
      "Abdoulaye Toure (Le Havre, £2.5m)\nTen Ligue 1 goals from midfield for Le Havre last season sounds very promising indeed but a 15th-place finish having conceded 71 goals does raise the question as to how good Toure was at his primary job of protecting the defence.",
      "And there’s a suspicion of him taking a ‘f*** it, I’m going to enjoy myself’ approach to football at the age of 31 given his 11 previous seasons of senior football have yielded 17 goals in total.",
      "",
      "Felix Nmecha (Borussia Dortmund, £24m)\nOne that got away from Manchester City, not in the sense that he would ever have played for them, but because he left them on a free transfer in 2021, two years before being sold by Wolfsburg to Borussia Dortmund for £26m.",
      "United have been linked with the 24-year-old, but David Ornstein claimed ‘interest’ hasn’t turned into anything more concrete.",
      "",
      "Amadou Onana (Aston Villa, £43m)\nSigned for £50m from Everton last summer, Onana had a largely forgettable first season at Villa Park, partly down to a couple of injuries but also because of Unai Emery’s typical preference for Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara at the base of midfield.",
      "That’s a tricky partnership to break in fairness to Onana, who would undoubtedly improve United’s midfield but his transfer may also feel a tad underwhelming, as often appears to be the case when he plays.",
      "",
      "Jean-Eudus Aholou (free agent)\nUnconfirmed reports suggest Qatari side Umm Salal SC have already swooped in ahead of United to sign the 31-year-old journeyman, who represented seven Ligue 1 clubs before ‘amicably terminating his contract’ with Angers this summer.",
      "",
      "Mario Martin (Real Madrid, £1.3m)\nAfter 20 La Liga games for Real Valladolid last season the 21-year-old’s off to Getafe on loan this term. We wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Manchester United making a £50m-plus move for the graduate of the Real Madrid academy in 2027, because why sign burgeoning talent on the cheap when you can pay big bucks for them after developing elsewhere?",
      "",
      "Johnny Cardoso (Atletico Madrid, £22m)\nLinked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the window as part of a possible Antony haggle, to the extent that there are several ‘Welcome to Manchester United’ videos on YouTube of the USMNT international, who instead swapped Real Betis for Atletico, which is in itself enough to suggest he would be the right sort of player to aid United. Diego Simeone loves a midfield pr*ck.",
      "",
      "Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham, £26m)\nHe was excellent against Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup and we love watching an on-song Bentancur, but he’s arguably the most Tottenham of all the Tottenham players, somehow managing to have the mercuriality of a 20-year-old winger as a 28-year-old defensive midfielder. We have every confidence that a move to Old Trafford would swallow him whole.",
      "",
      "Anton Stach (Leeds, £12m)\nAs much as we would enjoy the volume of boiled piss leaching into the rivers of West Yorkshire as a result of a player Leeds signed this summer moving immediately to Manchester United, it’s unfortunately unlikely to happen.",
      "",
      "Dario Essugo (Chelsea, £17m)\nWe have a sneaky feeling Chelsea may have another very, very good midfield destroyer on their hands in Essugo, who’s only just arrived from Sporting but will need at least one significant injury to play anything more than a bit-part role under Enzo Maresca this season, with Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Andrey Santos all very much above him in the pecking order. A loan move would be a smart option, but that’s not going to be to United.",
      "",
      "Seydouba Cisse (Leganes, £2.6m)\nRelegated with Leganes last season and a lack of interest in his services from sides remaining in the top tier suggests Cisse is not the big fix Amorim needs as the base of his midfield.",
      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "Manchester United have given up on signing Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, per David Ornstein.",

Player welfare, player shmelfare, and while our football itch has been scratched by that delightful bleeding of one season into the next, so too has our great desire to see big football clubs spend the GDP of small countries on new players in a transfer window featuring several middle fingers to the PSR overlords.",

The only thing conceivably better than both being absolute horses*t would be for Rasmus Hojlund and Kai Havertz to start ahead of them.",
      "This is a much kinder opening fixture for Amorim than it is for Arteta, as all he needs to do is show tangible improvement on last term by not getting walloped by a side for whom anything less than the Premier League title this season isn’t good enough.",

Having long thought Newcastle would at some point have to upgrade Howe in order to take the next step and challenge for the most major of major honours, we’re now left wondering whether they even deserve him.",

      "We don’t see Wirtz as a player who will hide in games or struggle to get involved, and we can’t wait to see how he fits into a Liverpool side who never looked as though they were missing a player of his enviable skill in a playmaker role as they stormed to the title last season.",

      "Sesko, who had also been linked with a move to Sunday's opponents Arsenal earlier in the transfer window, completed a move to Old Trafford last week in a move worth £74m from RB Leipzig. Asked whether the 22-year-old striker would be involved from the start against the Gunners, Amorim said:",
      "\"He hasn't had a lot of time, [but] physically he's ready.",

      "\"He's one guy who stays here, has lunch, and goes to the medical department, does the stretching.",

      "\"I don't need to tell Ben, 'Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready, every game is like do or die'.",
      "\"With that guy, I don't have that concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit.",

      "\"Benjamin Sesko is a big prospect but one with plenty to prove and his success could be crucial to Manchester United's rebuild under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.\"",

      "Friday 15 August 2025 09:34, UK",
      "“We struggled without a reference as a striker.” That was Ruben Amorim’s verdict on Manchester United’s final pre-season game against Fiorentina. “We have a new player, so we will see.” The hope is that Benjamin Sesko can make the difference.",
      "The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.",
      "But the modern United has become, perhaps, the ultimate test of that theory. At £73.7m, taking the summer spending on their new forward trio to over £200m, Ruben Amorim has certainly been backed. That brings pressure to make it work - and quickly.",
      "Amorim has been open about the fact that he is fortunate still to be in the job, reliant on the support of those above him after a miserable run of results that led to United's worst league finish in over 50 years. The consensus is that the mood has now changed.",
      "Luke Shaw recently admitted that the environment inside the club could be \"extremely negative\" and \"quite toxic\" before going on to claim that it is different now. Unhappy players have moved on. New ones have arrived with a point to prove. A cultural reset.",
      "Time on the training ground has helped too and the absence of European football means that there will be more of that throughout the campaign. Amorim will have the opportunity to demonstrate why he was regarded as a top young coach in the first place.",
      "The summer spending raises expectations, however. United are already fifth favourites for the title. Fail to secure European qualification and they will be out of Europe for back-to-back seasons for the first time since the ban on English clubs was lifted.",
      "The challenge is that Sesko is not the finished article. For now, at least, United are not in that market. And their opening Premier League game of the season offers an intriguing contrast. Opponents Arsenal tracked Sesko for a long time, a move seeming imminent.",
      "In the end, they opted for Viktor Gyokeres. The Sweden international has plundered well over 100 goals for club and country over the past two seasons at Sporting - more than Sesko has yet managed in his career. But he is 27. A signing for the here and the now.",
      "Maybe that reflects Arsenal's sense of urgency, a side that has been so close to major silverware in recent seasons, one that is seeking the final piece of their own puzzle. United are earlier in the process, betting on Sesko to develop into the superior player.",
      "His goal output might not be as immediately impressive as that of Gyokeres, but his 39 goals for RB Leipzig in all competitions over the past two seasons means that he has scored more than anyone else aged under 23 in Europe's five major leagues in that time.",
      "It puts him top of an illustrious list, although the presence of another name a little further down it is a reminder that, as former United coach Rene Meulensteen puts it, they are doing \"basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\" with this signing.",
      "That is to say, United are spending big hoping to develop their own elite forward. Hojlund scored nine for Atalanta in Serie A prior to his arrival. Joshua Zirkzee managed 11 for Bologna before signing the following summer. For Sesko, it was 13 at Leipzig.",
      "That might temper the expectations a little. But speak to others and they will tell you that Sesko has better instincts. He is a player capable of finding space in the penalty box, someone who can get his shots away unusually quickly for a player of his size.",
      "He is not yet Alexander Isak and that is reflected in the price tag. But Isak was 22 years old, as Sesko is now, when he arrived in the Premier League after a season in which he scored six times in 32 games for Real Sociedad in LaLiga. That is the trajectory to target.",
      "Making it happen is the difficult part and it is now Amorim's job to help Sesko succeed where so many in a United shirt have struggled in recent years and fulfil his potential. Flanked by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, there is at least creativity around him.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are strong ball carriers who draw others towards them, creating space. \"It is going to be special,\" said Amorim of his two new wide forwards after the Fiorentina game. \"I think that they are maybe at 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.\"",
      "Another word of caution, though. There is some risk that the opposite is true. There were only three players in the Premier League who outperformed their expected goals by six or more last season. One was Chris Wood. The other two were Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Of the 10 previous players to have done that over the past eight years, only Heung-Min Son has scored more goals in the following season - and he dipped dramatically the year after. The vast majority of players have seen their goal output regress to the mean.",
      "One of the reasons cited for Liverpool's signing of Hugo Ekitike is that he actually underperformed his expected goals - they recognised the potential for his numbers to explode. United appear to have gone the opposite route, trying to sign elite finishers.",
      "Sesko could fall into that category having scored 27 Bundesliga goals over the past two seasons from chances with an expected-goals value of just 17.6. Could he be another Son, another Harry Kane, who consistently finishes better than the metrics suggest?",
      "If so, it could define United's season and with it Amorim's reign. There are other factors, of course. The balance in midfield is a concern and the wing-backs will be key. But it is this new forward line that will probably dictate how the rebuild is perceived.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have Premier League pedigree which will buy them some time. Rather unfairly, the referendum on young Sesko may come sooner than that. A swift impact against Arsenal, with Gyokeres among the opposition, would be most helpful."

      "The Premier League's elite clubs are rebuilding.",
      "This summer has seen the so-called Big Six spend in excess of £1bn between them on new signings. With several weeks of the transfer window still to go, the numbers will continue to rise.",
      "Liverpool are leading the way as they aim to consolidate their Premier League title win but Chelsea are close to their total for money spent, with Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United next on the list respectively, and Spurs not far behind them.",
      "There is particular intrigue around the Manchester clubs.",
      "City recorded their lowest points total under Pep Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term. United plumbed far greater depths as they finished 15th and also failed to win silverware.",
      "So, are they on track to bounce back and enjoy the success their fans crave in the new season? Or is the road to the top longer? Much will depend on whether they can master the art of the rebuild, a process Sir Alex Ferguson once said he believed could take up to four years.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have of course been here before.",
      "How they would love a repeat of the successful rebuild overseen early in his tenure following his arrival from Bayern Munich, when City recovered from a difficult first campaign, like the one they have just had, to win the first of many titles in 2017/18.",
      "\"They are one of the exceptions to that four-year rule,\" says Neville.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho came into Chelsea and won their first league title in a long, long time in his first season, creating a kind of unity straight away. Pep Guardiola got a great side that won the title in the space of two years at Manchester City.\"",
      "Neville also mentions Arne Slot's achievement in winning the Premier League straight after succeeding the legendary Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. \"I would say it was a very different team than under Klopp, with different components and ingredients.\"",
      "What they all have in common, and something key to a successful rebuild in Neville's eyes, is that they inherited the right type of characters in the dressing room.",
      "\"You think of what Slot was handed last season: [Virgil] Van Dijk, Alisson, [Mohamed] Salah, [Andrew] Robertson, [Alexis] Mac Allister, Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",
      "\"They are five or six proven winners at the highest level and they have been around the block. They've got pride and ego and they are not going to sit there and use the fact there's a new manager coming in as an excuse not to perform well.",
      "\"Players can hide behind managers. But if you've got good characters and leaders, people who have standards in their personal lives, you're going to get a better outcome.",
      "\"Slot harnessed that. He did a good job with those leaders. But he is not the one in the dressing room. People may or may not know this, but managers might not go in the dressing room at the training ground even for one minute during the week.",
      "\"For all those hours, it is policed by the senior players.\"",
      "Heavy investment was of course vital to the success of those previous Chelsea and Manchester City's rebuilds. But both Mourinho and Guardiola also inherited senior players to build around.",
      "For Mourinho at Chelsea, it was John Terry and Frank Lampard. Guardiola could call on Fernandinho, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at City.",
      "Guardiola has some similar characters now in Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, among others. At United, though, Amorim inherited very different personnel to the dressing room Neville experienced there in his playing days.",
      "\"For us it was Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce. Then when me, [Paul] Scholesy and others got older, it was us. When we left, others took over,\" he explains.",
      "\"You're asking those players in the dressing room to set the standards, to make sure negativity doesn't creep in. The people who sap energy, close them off straight away. Don't let them drain you, the people who constantly whinge in a negative way\"",
      "Amorim is still in the process of overhauling his dressing room as he aims to reverse a years-long slide from their success under Ferguson. Manchester United have signed three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko but are still struggling to shift numerous unwanted players.",
      "\"This is a really unique situation,\" says Neville. \"I said before that you don't get three or four years to build a team, but because of Manchester United's relentless poor form over two, three, four or five years, it will take quite a bit to unwind that.",
      "\"Amorim has got players he quite clearly doesn't want and doesn't like, players on huge money, some of whom have cost huge money. And even if you do get them out, some of their wages will probably have to be subsidised by the club.",
      "\"So, I think he has a minimum of a two-and-a-half-year build to get to the point he wants with his unique system and buying the players he wants to fit that, just because of what has gone on there previously, but he's going to have to demonstrate progress.",
      "\"The problem he has is that you've got a top five now who like they are getting into the Champions League and the penalty for not being in the Champions League is big now because all these clubs - United, Villa, Newcastle, Chelsea - are on the edge on PSR.",
      "\"It's big for them if they drop out of those Champions League places. So Amorim has got to be relatively successful, which means finishing in the top four or top five, all while building a new team and recruiting the players he wants.\"",
      "Circumstances matter too when it comes to rebuilding efficiently. Guardiola knows that well given the importance of expiring contracts to his first Manchester City overhaul. A long list of departures in 2017 gave him space to reshape his squad.",
      "The list of players who reached the ends of their deals after Guardiola's first season included Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna and Jesus Navas. This summer, by contrast, the only one feels like a significant loss in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Guardiola points out there was a significant loss back in 2017 too. \"In that moment, we made one big mistake which was to not keep Jesus Navas with us,\" he says.",
      "\"I think he would have helped us a lot for the next years because he was a player who could play as a full-back, as a full-back inside, as a right-winger. He was incredible.",
      "\"For the rest, the club decided they needed new, fresh energy, so that's why we rebuilt. They bought some unbelievable players like Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva; top-class players who helped us start to do what we have done.\"",
      "Manchester City are having to work harder to shift players this time around. Their signings so far this summer have left them with a squad of 33 as things stand.",
      "Their plight last season shows the importance of forward planning. Could City's drop-off have been avoided if they had acted sooner to refresh their personnel?",
      "\"It's bloody hard when you've got a team that's won the treble, and a group of players who have been so good,\" says Neville. \"But they do tend to grow a little bit old together.",
      "\"It's about how you change it and when you change it when you have been as successful as they have been. To do it after a treble is the most difficult time.\"",
      "Neville sees some parallels between the plight of City's treble-winning team and that of United's in 1998/99.",
      "\"It felt like we only signed one or two players in the two years after the treble. We won the league in those years but then we saw a sharp decline and we only won one of the next four.",
      "\"You get this euphoric moment winning a treble, where you've built an unbelievable team, but within a couple of years they grow a little bit old together and you've got a situation where you can fall off the edge of a cliff and end up having to make big changes.\"",
      "Neville describes Manchester City's current rebuild as Guardiola's \"toughest job\" in management. \"You get to the point where you think, 'will he win it next season, or will it take two or three years?'\" he says. But the man himself sees it differently.",
      "\"The most challenging summer was when I was chosen to be the manager of the second team at Barcelona and prove myself to the board,\" he says with a smile.",
      "\"Then the challenge was to take over the Barcelona first team and prove myself, and after that go to Germany after the legend Jupp Heynckes had won the treble, when my German language was a disaster, to convince the players to keep going and winning.",
      "\"Then it was arriving here and in the first press conference they said, 'the club have brought you here to win the Champions League', and I said, 'wait a minute, please!' After that I was 'Fraudiola' and it was a disaster in the seasons we didn't win it.\"",
      "Guardiola is eager to point out that he saw progress even in his fraught first season, when he was assisted by now Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City finished 15 points behind eventual Premier League champions Chelsea.",
      "\"In the first season we played really, really well in moments,\" he says. \"Always with Mikel we talk about that, that in that first season we started to build something. This season is not the most difficult one because we did it. We proved we could do it.\"",
      "Guardiola is encouraged by how his side finished last season too, even if it ended in the disappointment of a second consecutive FA Cup final loss at Wembley, this time to Crystal Palace.",
      "\"I didn't like the way we lost against Man Utd in the [previous] FA Cup final. I was grumpy. This season, I was sad because we played really, really well. They know it. They knew we were there, the spirit was there, the chances were there.",
      "\"We missed something we have to recover next season. That belongs to me, it belongs to the players, it belongs to all of us. And after that we will create a team which can compete game by game and start in a better position in the Premier League.\"",
      "Guardiola stresses that pain forms part of every rebuild.",
      "That was true even for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who mastered the art during his historic Old Trafford tenure, creating a series of trophy-winning teams.",
      "\"Each transition came with a bit of turbulence,\" says Neville.",
      "\"We then lost the first game of the next season and Alan Hansen said you can't win anything with kids. So, it was a lot of pressure at that time, changing and transitioning, and that is something you have to manage in a rebuild.",
      "\"We didn't win the league for three years between 2003 and 2006. That's the longest I ever went in my career. That was a point where Mourinho was absolutely on his game and [Arsene] Wenger's football was sensational. They were brilliant teams.",
      "\"Our recruitment wasn't the best. It took a while for Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to come through, for Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra to settle in.",
      "\"That was the time where I thought, 'will we win the league again?' We did it in 2006 and that set us up for another five or six years of winning titles because that team was amazing. But the key was the foresight and bravery Sir Alex had to let players go.\"",
      "The principles behind that ruthlessness remain crucial in today's game. It is about lowering the age of the squad and striking a balance between youth and experience while ensuring there is room for long-term growth and development.",
      "\"I used to think of it as a conveyer belt,\" says Neville. \"We came in in '92, '93, '94. We were the young ones at the start of the conveyor belt and we had the older ones falling off. We eventually moved on to the end of the conveyor belt and fell off ourselves.",
      "\"I always thought you needed a group of players that were young, a group of players in their peak, and then a few, four or five, who were in their 30s and set the standards. I think that was the sort of age profile Sir Alex considered when building teams, but there was always some turbulence.\"",
      "As their respective rebuilds continue, Manchester United and City will hope the turbulence eases for them in the new campaign.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back in the Premier League predictions chair to provide his insight and best bets.",
      "The case for an Aston Villa win is very compelling at 6/5 with Sky Bet when assessing all the evidence.",
      "Alexander Isak is missing for Newcastle in a saga that has been managed appallingly by those advising him - it didn't need to be like this.",
      "Of course, Eddie Howe has managed the situation perfectly, giving Isak the disappointed dad treatment rather than going too heavy on him in public. Howe is a master in these situations, but one area in management where he does struggle, looking at his recor,d is getting a team to start the season fast.",
      "Across the first three league games of a season for each club he's managed, he's only working at a 1.25 points per game ratio (P24 W8 D6 L10) and a winless pre-season won't have helped preparations for this one.",
      "Across the Champions League and Premier League, Villa are unbeaten in 24 home games, winning the last seven - including beating Newcastle 4-1 in April.",
      "If there's one fixture flying under the radar that screams goals at the prices this weekend, it's this one. I'm here banging the drum for the over 2.5 goals line at 4/6 with Sky Bet as a base to build a bet from.",
      "Brighton like to be positive at home and play with attacking risk in committing bodies forward, but that leaves gaps which expose their centre-backs. That's why backing the over line in their games last season was a betting-friendly angle, with 27 of their 38 games producing three or more goals.",
      "This has the smell of a goalless grind, doesn't it?",
      "I'm struggling to see how Sunderland score goals at this level. They only scored 1.29 goals per game last season - the eighth-highest in the Sky Bet Championship. Even Sheffield Wednesday averaged more.",
      "Regis Le Bris is someone who is suited to defence-first football and that is very hard to implement in this league with the quality in opposition ranks. Low-probability chances get taken.",
      "Le Bris will want to make this a scrap, kill the tempo, and smother the game. It's Sunderland's best chance for points.",
      "I wouldn't talk you out of the 0-0 correct score at a juicy price of 11/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Now I'm not for one second suggesting Scott Parker's side are about to storm North London and walk away with three points, but I do think the markets are disrespecting Burnley's potential to keep this competitive and overrating Spurs slightly based on their Super Cup heroics.",
      "This is a tough gig for Thomas Frank. Expectation is internally very high and Frank has no experience of managing workloads within a squad asked to compete across four competitions.",
      "They looked strong and organised for large parts vs PSG, but I think we need to treat that piece of form very carefully as the French side were clearly miles undercooked.",
      "Burnley aren't going to change their rigid and pragmatic style going up a level. This could be fiddly for Spurs as Burnley should be able to cover their +1.5 goal start handicap at 4/5 with Sky Bet, meaning we just need them not to lose by two or more goals.",
      "Jhon Arias could just take the Premier League by storm in this Wolves team. All the evidence suggests he'll adapt pretty quickly, be a main man in attack and judging by what I saw at the Club World Cup and from people who follow the Brazilian league, he has the quality to thrive in England.",
      "Wolves have played the Brazilian market very shrewdly in recent years, with Joao Gomes and Andre showing real adaptability to the league.",
      "Quick, direct and a great drawer of fouls, Arias will be to the fore for Wolves as they look to take advantage of Man City's vulnerabilities in transition without Rodri. Back him to be fouled at least twice through the Sky Bet BuildABet function at Evens.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "Saturday 16 August 2025 07:01, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "By Nick Wright and Adam Smith",
      "Saturday 16 August 2025 07:32, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "Read on to see our top 25 Premier League players - and then join the debate yourself in our live blog, where we want you to list your favourite footballers and debate and discuss our selections!",
      "Arsenal's defence was the meanest in the Premier League last season and Gabriel gets the recognition from our journalists and reporters - no doubt also impressed by his repeated threat from set-pieces at the other end of the pitch.",
      "Where would Man Utd be without Bruno Fernandes? That was a recurring question last season. Amid all of his team's travails, the Portugal midfielder's quality remains respected.",
      "Another driving force of Arsenal's title prospects, Declan Rice is becoming the complete midfielder in the centre of the park for the Gunners. If the football world is increasingly being filled by specialists, the England man can seemingly do it all.",
      "Arsenal supporters will surely want to see Bukayo Saka further up this list and their Star Boy could well prove this coming season he deserves a promotion. The next step is to inspire his team to success with his individual brilliance.",

      "The transfer saga of the summer? Alexander Isak's future at Newcastle is uncertain but his quality isn't in doubt. There's a reason why the Sweden striker is in demand after a brilliant campaign in black and white.",
      "Man City badly missed Rodri through his injury absence last season. If anything it underlined his importance to Pep Guardiola's side even more. He continues to be considered among the best in the world - fingers crossed he can return to his former levels.",
      "We love a maverick and Chelsea's Cole Palmer is one of the Premier League's top entertainers. He delivers in the big moments too - whether that's a Euros final with England or when Chelsea are in major finals.",
