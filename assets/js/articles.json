      "Despite their best efforts to turn a corner, Manchester United are still struggling to find their footing this season. Following their worst season in recent memory, the Red Devils splashed out over £200million in the summer on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in an attempt to bolster Ruben Amorim's forward line.",
      "But despite addressing one major problem, another long-term issue has once again raised its head this campaign. United continue to be plagued by an imbalanced midfield that is frequently overrun by lesser teams.",
      "As previously reported, club bosses and Amorim are acutely aware of the need for investment in central midfield. And as part of their long-term rebuilding strategy, the Red Devils are set to prioritise two signings in next summer's transfer window.",
      "One name that keeps cropping up is Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford last summer following an enquiry, but Brighton ultimately dismissed United's interest in the 21-year-old.",
      "It is understood that Amorim's interest in the Cameroon international, Baleba, remains high, despite Brighton's hefty asking price of around £100m. That can be deemed a price worth paying.",
      "Another starlet on United's radar is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, who carries a similar price tag of between £100m-£120m. The versatile midfielder, capable of playing both as a No.6 and as a roaming midfielder, has attracted significant attention following his standout performances for Forest and the England national team.",
      "Anderson, one of English football's brightest prospects, is already on Amorim's watchlist. The Portuguese manager previously praised the England star ahead of their match against Forest this season, labelling him a \"very good player\". It appears that admiration has now turned into genuine interest.",
      "Sky Germany reports the 23-year-old doesn't have a release clause, putting Forest in a strong bargaining position. However, it's believed that the Red Devils are prepared to go all out to secure his services.",
      "Signing both players for a combined fee of £200m might raise a few eyebrows, but it's certainly a necessary investment. They would form the midfield backbone for the team for years to come, providing Amorim with much more stability and balance in the centre of the pitch than his current options.",
      "The Portuguese boss has been forced to deploy Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role this season within his 3-4-2-1 system, partnering him with either the ageing Casemiro or underwhelming Manuel Ugarte. In that position, the United captain’s defensive discipline and focus have occasionally been found wanting, with opposition sides capitalising to damaging effect.",
      "Bringing in Baleba and Anderson would enable Fernandes to move back into his favoured role as one of the attacking playmakers operating behind the striker, sharing his game time with players such as Cunha. At 31, the Portugal international has likely already delivered his best performances in a United shirt, and managing his minutes more carefully could benefit both player and club moving forward.",
      "There's also the possibility of selling the playmaker, who nearly moved to Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal during the summer transfer window before rejecting their lucrative offer. If they return with a bid in the region of £70m, United might be wise to accept such a lofty fee to finance their double midfield swoop.",
      "Looking beyond their midfield concerns, United could also set their sights on Crystal Palace right wing-back Daniel Munoz. The Colombian has impressed at Selhurst Park since arriving from Belgian outfit Genk in 2024, and recently confessed it would be a \"dream\" to don the famous red Devils shirt.",
      "While Munoz is under contract at Palace until 2028, he appears to be thinking about the next stage of his career. However, he admitted he has no “concrete information” that United, or his other dream destinations - Barcelona, PSG and Real Madrid - have any real interest in signing him.",
      "His qualities would certainly make him a valuable addition to Amorim’s squad. The 29-year-old has played 81 appearances for the Eagles, scoring eight times. His tireless work-rate and attacking prowess also helped the club lift the FA Cup and Community Shield, and he would be a worthy successor to Diogo Dalot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly set to launch a basketball team, according to the President of the Italian Basketball Federation, Gianni Petrucci. It has been claimed that the Red Devils have given the green light to participate in NBA Europe.",
      "The scheme will see major European cities, including Manchester, hosting 10 or 12 founding franchises. It aims to capitalise on the growing popularity of basketball outside of America and within Europe.",
      "Speaking to Italian publication Corriere dello Sport, Petrucci stated: \"It's a new league that will be good for the system, bringing resources and entertainment. The agreement also notes that registered clubs must participate in their respective domestic leagues.\"",
      "He further added: \"In a $50 billion (£37.9bn) market, European basketball has a commercial value of just $200 million (£152m).",
      "\"An NBA league is precisely the opportunity to increase competitiveness and expand the pool.\"",
      "\"If Manchester United, the most popular football team in the world, has already said yes, there must be a reason.\"",
      "The potential kick-off date for NBA Europe is currently slated for the beginning of the 2027/28 season.",
      "This news comes as co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe seeks additional revenue streams to boost the club's finances. Despite record revenues last year, the club continues to lose money.",
      "The Mirror have contacted Manchester United for comment.",
      "If the plans proceed, it won't be the first time that the club has owned a basketball team. Back in the 1980s, Manchester United's basketball side clinched a league championship and drew crowds of around 1,500 at Stretford Sports Centre.",
      "They competed against heavyweights like Barcelona and Real Madrid. However, the franchise was short-lived.",
      "In 1988, a group of local businessmen purchased the team, rebranding it as Manchester Eagles and later Manchester Giants after merging with Olympic City Giants. The current squad is known as Manchester Basketball and was formed in 2024, following the demise of the British Basketball League and Manchester Giants.",

      "A word of warning. A friend had a saying about statistics being used to make a judgement on what might or might not happen in football. He said they were the last refuge of the scoundrel. Or something like that.",
      "And we all know the more general maxim about lies and damned lies. But it is the international break, so for the Premier League obsessive, there has been plenty of time to look at facts and figures from the opening 11 games if you are interested in that sort of stuff.",
      "And if you had a lot of time to fill, you might even have looked at the tables at this stage of every season in Premier League history. Here is what you would have found.",
      "In 16 of the 33 seasons, the team that has led after 11 fixtures has gone on to win the title. That means that on 17 occasions, a team that has been top of the table after 11 games has NOT gone on to become Premier League champions.",
      "And the team responsible for FIVE of those instances was Arsenal. The last side not to win the Premier League after being top at the 11-game mark was Arsenal.",
      "At this stage in 2022/23, the Gunners held a four-point lead over Manchester City, who would go on to become champions. The Gunners currently hold a four-point lead over Manchester City.",
      "As my mate implied, these statistics should have zero influence over the destiny of this season’s title. But what they do show is that leading the table after 11 games does not make overall success anything close to a formality.",
      "And one mildly interesting aspect to these statistics is the gap that has been bridged by teams who have trailed at this stage but have gone on to win the title. In terms of points, the furthest any eventual champion has been from the top at this stage of the season is eight. And that has only happened twice.",
      "But it can happen, which is why the five teams currently on 18 points cannot be ruled out of the title race. Which is why Manchester United cannot be ruled out of the title race.",
      "Yes, United play Wolves twice in three December weeks. Happy Christmas. Of their next five away trips, only one is of any serious distance.",
      "But that road trip to Crystal Palace is followed by visits to Wolves, Aston Villa, Leeds and Burnley. There will not be many festive hours on the road for Amorim and his men.",
      "Numerically, the fixture list only gives United an advantage over those who have European and EFL Cup commitments. And most of those appear to boast stronger squads than the one Amorim has. But the impact made by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, not to mention the steadying effect of keeper Senne Lammens, has been significant.",
      "In the last two games of their unbeaten five-match run - 2-2 draws at Spurs and Nottingham Forest - United have hardly been electric, but they now look like a team that believes in the manager’s system and that, most crucially, believes it is going to win matches. And that is a good portion of the battle.",
      "With the bookmakers, United are between 33-1 and 50-1 to win the title and there is a reason bookies are very rich. They don’t get much wrong.",
      "But of those two teams who have indeed overcome an eight-point deficit after 11 games and gone on to be crowned Premier League champions, the most recent did it in the 2002/23 season. Manchester United. If only for the coincidence punter, Amorim’s side might be worth a bet.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Worry not, England fans, the Three Lions are already among those. A number of other big-hitters including Argentina, Brazil, France and Portugal are also already World Cup-bound.",

      "A £74m signing for Manchester United in the summer, striker Benjamin Sesko has been one of his country’s brightest hopes for the last few years. There’s no doubt he is a talent but that’s not been enough to help Slovenia to the World Cup.",

      "Who will win next year's World Cup? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "Sticking with Man United, they’ve got even more players set to stay behind during the World Cup. Cameroon’s failure to qualify will see both goalkeeper Andre Onana - who is currently on loan at Trabzonspor - and Bryan Mbeumo sidelined next summer.",
      "The African side took on DR Congo on Thursday aiming to book a spot in the final of the playoffs, only for ex-Newcastle defender Chancel Mbemba to seal victory late on for his side.",
      "Across the North West, a number of Liverpool stars will have just a watching brief during the World Cup. Hungary looked to be in an excellent place to at least seal a playoff place having gone 2-1 up in their winner takes all clash with Republic of Ireland.",
      "But they transpired to collapse in Budapest, with a Troy Parrot hat-trick turning the game on its head. That condemned Hungary to a third-place finish in their group and saw them stripped of a potential place at the World Cup. It also means that Liverpool pair Dominik Szoboszlai and Milos Kerkez will not be at the tournament.",
      "After being absent from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Nigeria will now miss a second consecutive tournament. They got as far as the final of the play-off tournament and took on DR Congo.",
      "And despite Frank Onyeka giving Nigeria an early lead, they ultimately went on to eventually lose on penalties. Their failure will see a number of stars left at home including Galatasaray star Victor Osimhen, Fulham forward Alex Iwobi and Atalanta sensation Ademola Lookman.",
      "A name familiar to Premier League fans, the Gabonese forward enjoyed a sensational spell with Arsenal before taking in stints with Barcelona and Chelsea, as well as in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Gabon have never played at a World Cup and cruelly saw their latest efforts ended in brutal fashion. They took on Nigeria this international window, finding themselves 1-0 down.",
      "Ex-Southampton star Mario Lemina scored late on to take the game into extra-time, only for Nigeria to score three times to seal a dramatic win.",
      "A member of England’s qualifying group, Serbia came so close to at least getting a playoff spot. A 2-1 win against Latvia in their final match saw them finish just one point behind Albania in the race for second spot.",
      "Their failure to qualify will see a number of talented forwards including Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic out of action next summer.",

      "Manchester United may be homing in a potential solution to one positional conundrum that's been plaguing the squad for some time now. That's after the player in question admitted it would be a \"dream\" to join the Red Devils one day.",
      "Ruben Amorim is coming off the back of a transfer window that has had a very positive impact at United. So much so that Sir Alex Ferguson has come out voicing his approval for one signing in particular.",
      "Crystal Palace full-back Daniel Munoz has put his hand up as a potential future signing for Amorim after saying it would be a \"dream come true\" to play for United. The Colombian is enjoying a superb sophomore season at Selhurst Park but recently included the Red Devils among his list of ideal transfer destinations.",
      "\"First of all, I think there’s a lot of talk about one club or another,\" he told AS. \"If you ask me, it would be a dream come true to play for one of these clubs, whether it’s Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.\"",
      "There can be no more certain a gesture that a player would be receptive to a transfer inquiry. And given United's issues filling the right wing-back slot as Amorim's system demands, Munoz could be an ideal addition.",
      "Amad Diallo is currently occupying the role, while Noussair Mazraoui and Digo Dalot have offered support there when fit. Even prior to Amorim's arrival, there was debate as to whether the right side of the defence had the talent required.",
      "Though on the older side of United's usual transfer policy, that would in theory reduce the fee Palace might expect for Munoz. And after excelling under Oliver Glasner, the former Genk talisman could be an understated answer to one of the Red Devils' long-term dilemmas.",
      "\"I think I’m working towards that,\" added Munoz before hinting he'd be open to a mid-season switch. \"I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because it’s a dream of mine to get there.",
      "\"Right now I’m focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. If you ask me, I don’t have any concrete information that any of these clubs are interested in me.",
      "\"My focus is on Crystal Palace; we’ll see when the winter transfer window gets closer. Right now, I’m fully focused on these two matches with the national team.\"",
      "Amid the swell of fresh faces that arrived at Old Trafford over the summer, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha stick out as some of the more impressive. The pair formed part of a £200million attacking makeover alongside Benjamin Sesko, and fans have been largely impressed by their impact to date.",
      "However, Ferguson's attention was more focused on the opposite end of the field after addressing the new arrival that has left the biggest mark. And the United great has been thrilled by the upgrade effect Senne Lammens has had between the posts.",
      "\"There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,\" he told Raceday RTV. \"Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they’ve added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - the signs are getting better.",
      "\"I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they’ll enjoy it now.\"",

So far this season, the Slovenian international has netted two goals and provided one assist in his 12 appearances across all competitions.",
      "However, Sesko hit a bump in the road in his last match before the international break - a 2-2 stalemate away at Tottenham - where he was brought on as a second-half substitute only to be quickly taken off due to a suspected knee injury. Consequently, the 22-year-old did not join his national team and has spent the break working towards regaining his fitness.",
      "Reports this week suggest the striker is still a few weeks away from making a comeback, meaning he's likely to sit out several crucial matches after the international break. As the January transfer window looms, rumours about potential new arrivals are naturally gaining momentum.",
      "One name that has been loosely associated with a move to Old Trafford is ex-striker Welbeck, and pundit Don Hutchison reckons the Brighton forward would be the perfect guide for Sesko as he adjusts to the English top tier.",
      "\"I mean, it'd be a brilliant fit,\" Hutchison said in an interview with SportCasting. \"He'd be a fantastic signing because Danny Welbeck's one of those players where, if he went back to Man United, it would be like when Jonny Evans returned.",
      "\"When Jonny Evans went back there a couple of years ago, he was happy to be a sort of mentor inside the dressing room. He was happy to be a mentor to the players that were playing. He was happy to play his part when needed. He was happy to be on the bench.",
      "\"I think Danny Welbeck going to Man United would be a really good fit in terms of he can still play, he can still score goals, he's still really fit. But he would still have the attitude where it would be a fantastic move forward, being back at Man United with the knowledge that he'd be mentoring the likes of Sesko. I think it would be a perfect move.\"",
      "Welbeck progressed through United's academy system and clocked up more than 140 first-team outings before his switch to Arsenal in 2014.",
      "He subsequently had a stint at Watford prior to his Brighton move in 2020, where he's experienced a career revival - especially this campaign, netting six times in 11 Premier League matches to date.",
      "This wouldn't be the first occasion the 34-year-old has been touted for a stunning Old Trafford comeback, with speculation also surfacing around this period last year.",
      "However, at present, there's no solid evidence suggesting United are plotting a swoop for the striker.",

      "Chelsea summer signing Alejandro Garnacho has barely had time to settle in before rumours have started swirling that his position could be under threat. And the potential competition is none other than Marcus Rashford.",
      "Both players experienced their own forms of exile at Manchester United last season before departing Old Trafford in the summer. Garnacho, 21, completed a bargain £40million move to Stamford Bridge, while 28-year-old Rashford was loaned out to Barcelona.",
      "Garnacho has been in the starting line-up for Chelsea's last five Premier League matches and assisted two of their three goals in a victory over Wolves just prior to the international break. However, if Rashford were to join the Blues, Garnacho's spot would immediately be up for grabs.",
      "This scenario is becoming increasingly likely as Rashford's brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, is reported to have held talks with Chelsea. El Nacional claims Rashford's representative was in London for negotiations, while Tottenham are also said to be in discussions.",
      "Barcelona hold first-refusal rights on Rashford and can sign him permanently next summer for a fee of around £28m. The player has seen a revival in Spain and appears to be worth the price tag after contributing 15 direct goal contributions (six goals, nine assists) in only 16 appearances under Hansi Flick.",
      "The England forward is on track to hit double figures for the first time since his 30-goal haul under Erik ten Hag in the 2022/23 season. However, United might be hoping Barca don't make his signing permanent, knowing they could command a higher fee in today's market.",
      "Rumours are swirling that Rashford has had enough of life at United, particularly with the prospect of playing under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. Yet, a return to Premier League action isn't out of the question if Chelsea decide to pursue their interest.",
      "Garnacho used the tension between Rashford and United to engineer his own departure from the club earlier this year. The Argentine star posted a photo of himself donning Rashford's Aston Villa shirt in June, just as Rashford was wrapping up a six-month loan spell in Birmingham.",

      "Enzo Maresca seems to be a big admirer of Garnacho's talent and has given him more responsibility in the starting line-up recently. Cole Palmer's recent injury problems have worked in his favour, although he could find himself back on the bench once the Englishman is fit again.",
      "Rashford's impressive form at Barcelona hasn't gone unnoticed by England boss Thomas Tuchel, who brought the forward back into the starting line-up for the recent 2-0 victory over Serbia. Meanwhile, Garnacho has been overlooked by Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni and is one year removed from his last international appearance.",
      "While United would ideally want to get the highest possible price for Rashford if he were to leave, selling to a direct competitor comes with its own risks. And this could be one reunion that Garnacho might prefer to avoid if it were to jeopardise his position at Chelsea.",

      "Marcus Rashford is reportedly relishing a quieter existence at Barcelona as Manchester United's transfer strategy starts to crystallise.",
      "The England forward moved to Barcelona during the summer on a season-long loan following Ruben Amorim's decision to exclude him from the United squad. The 28-year-old now seems closer than ever to departing the club where he initially rose to prominence.",
      "Rashford entered the United academy at merely seven years old. A native of the city, he is a genuine Mancunian and swiftly became a supporters' favourite at Old Trafford as he progressed into the senior side. He rapidly became not just one of the most prominent figures in Manchester, but a significant presence on the world stage.",
      "His disagreement with Amorim was extensively reported, and his loan period at Aston Villa indicated a desire to distance himself from the club where he developed.",
      "Now, with Spanish heavyweights Barcelona, Rashford is appreciating not being the focal point, according to The Times.",
      "They wrote: \"Around his new club Rashford is said to be more shy and reserved, while his introduction in August seemed almost deliberately low-key. Those close to Rashford insist this was how he wanted it, the attention dialled down and the noise put on mute.",
      "\"Yamal is the real star at Barcelona, their teenage sensation whose personal life makes headlines and whose form and fitness spin the wheel of national debate.\"",
      "Despite Rashford's stellar performances for Barcelona, United bosses are reportedly sticking to their long-term plan for the England star.",

      "Former Premier League star Kieron Dyer has revealed how he agreed to \"kick up some noise\" at Newcastle United in his bid to secure a move to Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. Dyer was at his brilliant best at St. James' Park when Ferguson came calling - quite literally.",
      "The Old Trafford legend was one of numerous bosses who tried to sign Dyer during his early days playing in England's top flight. The ex-midfielder narrowly missed out on Premier League promotion with Ipswich Town in 1999 when a host of top clubs were chasing his signature.",
      "Dyer was quizzed about which sides were keen to snap him up from Ipswich and told the Open Goal podcast: \"Juventus, I know Arsenal, I know Newcastle because Ruud Gullit rung me, I know Leeds because David O'Leary rung me, I know West Ham because Harry Redknapp rung me all when I'm in Ayia Napa, steaming, so I'm thinking, 'What a time to ring!'",
      "\"Everyone talks about your journey but what is so great is taking your friends on the journey with you. Can you imagine, I've got Ruud Gullit on the phone [in front of my friends] and I'm going, 'it's Ruud!'\"",
      "Regarding Ferguson's pursuit of the player, Dyer disclosed just how far the Scot went to test his ambition for the move. And Dyer, who was already at Newcastle by then, was so excited by the prospect that he agreed to help his suitors if it meant joining forces at Old Trafford.",
      "\"There was a time with Man United when I was at Newcastle and my agent rings me and goes, 'I'm now putting you on speaker phone,'\" he continued. \"I'm at the airport at New York me and Titus [Bramble] are coming back to England.",
      "\"[My agent] says, 'You're now going to hear a few voices', the first voice was Pini Zahavi who was the 'super agent', he was Rio [Ferdinand's] agent then the next voice was, 'Hi Kieron, it's Sir Alex,' so I'm like [gestures mouthing Sir Alex Ferguson while pointing at the phone].",
      "\"He said, 'I just want you to answer me two questions, first is do you want to come and play for Manchester United?' I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
      "\"The second was, 'If [Newcastle] don't accept the bid will you go and kick up some noise?' Then I was like, 'Yeah, yeah,' and that was it, he just hung up the phone.\"",
      "Hardly the kind of encouraging reaction Dyer might have anticipated after confirming he'd commit one of football's most heinous crimes. Yet the gaffer may well have been cautious about appearing overly committed by offering a glowing endorsement of Dyer's willingness.",
      "Ultimately, the transfer fell through. United tabled a £15million offer for Dyer but saw their approach knocked back when they were unwilling to match Newcastle's reported £25m asking price. He racked up 250 appearances for the Magpies, even earning a spot in the Premier League Team of the Year after the 2002/03 campaign.",
      "Dyer later donned the jerseys of QPR and Middlesbrough before hanging up his boots at the Riverside in 2013. With no major silverware to his name from his playing career, he might wonder whether things would have been different had he secured that move to United all those years ago.",

      "Former Newcastle United and Manchester United midfielder Liam O'Brien has shared a memory of the moment he left Sir Alex Ferguson speechless after announcing his departure from United to join Newcastle in 1988.",
      "The former Republic of Ireland star, who was seeking additional security for his family, turned down a contract offer from United to make the move. In his new book 'Pass Master', O'Brien delves into the challenges faced by professional footballers in the 80s and how even being a star at Old Trafford didn't guarantee a bright future.",
      "O'Brien went on to become a legend at Newcastle, scoring memorable goals against Sunderland at Roker Park and playing a crucial role in Kevin Keegan's Entertainers. However, after rejecting Fergie's offer of just £400 per week, O'Brien - in the era before football agents - found himself meeting Newcastle coaches Willie McFaul and Colin Suggett for transfer discussions a service station, sealing the deal beside the motorway.",
      "But it was when he broke the news to Ferguson that the legendary Man United boss gave him a piece of his mind over the phone. Reflecting on the moment he confirmed his move to Newcastle, O'Brien said: \"I didn't expect him to be impressed with the news I had to tell him.",
      "\"I have something to tell you,' I said. 'I'm after signing for Newcastle United.' There was a moment of silence.",
      "\"A pregnant pause. He wasn't one bit impressed. He went through me. Who did I think I was walking out of a club like Manchester United?",
      "\"After he had his say, the phone went dead. Suddenly.",
      "\"It took some time for Alex Ferguson to talk to me again. When I met him a few months later, he didn't speak. Eventually, the ice did thaw – although it took a couple of years.\"",
      "\"There were suggestions that Alex and myself had this big bust-up before I left Old Trafford but that wasn't the case. There was no big row.",
      "\"Did I have regrets that I left Man United – especially considering what they achieved later under Ferguson? No, I didn't and don't now, all these years later.\"",
      "O'Brien will always be remembered as a key player in Newcastle's transformation from narrowly avoiding relegation in Division Two to competing in Europe within two years. The former midfielder was a fan favourite, and he still speaks passionately about Sir John Hall's vision that nearly brought the Premier League title to the Magpies.",
      "Speaking to Chronicle Live, O'Brien said: \"Sir John Hall and Kevin Keegan drove it and the stadium shot up from old terraces to all-seater. There's a video somewhere of Sir John with one of those time capsules burying it into the ground.",
      "\"That was when the Leazes End was being built and he said: 'In 100 years time when this is knocked down they'll find this and people will wonder what it was all about'.",
      "\"But it happened so quickly. The stadium is now magnificent. The atmosphere is brilliant, but that was the start of it.",
      "\"Outsiders questioned Kevin Keegan coming in but the Newcastle fans already adored him for what he did as a player.",
      "\"He was a man coming into the club who had not managed and been living in Marbella! He didn't know any of the players to be honest. He was taking a massive gamble really, if it hadn't worked out for him it was his career.",
      "\"When he came in, it could not have gone better. We staved off relegation in the old Second Division then the next year we couldn't believe how well we started. Then it just went from there, and before you knew it Newcastle were in Europe.\"",
      "O'Brien left Newcastle in 1994 for Tranmere Rovers but had already made his mark on Tyneside. His new book features a photograph of Keegan embracing the Irishman at Filbert Street moments after a 2-1 victory in 1992 that guaranteed the club's Second Division status and set the stage for future seasons.",
      "The former Toon midfielder recalled: \"We went into that game at Filbert Street knowing we needed a win and couldn't afford to lose it. We didn't know what would happen to us if he we lost.",
      "\"So there was a lot of tension and nerves at Filbert Street between the players. We actually conceded a late goal and didn't know what it would mean for us.",
      "\"But luckily enough Steve Walsh scored an own goal. It caused all the fans to run on the pitch.",
      "\"We were worried that the game would get abandoned because time wasn't quite up but in the end the result stood, we stayed up and the rest is history.\"",
      "Despite his frosty departure from Old Trafford under Ferguson, O'Brien recalls a pivotal moment when the legendary United boss showed him crucial support during what felt like his darkest hour. Following a red card in a televised match against Southampton - during an era when live football was far less common on British screens - O'Brien's challenge on Mark Dennis came under intense scrutiny.",
      "The early dismissal even prompted Bobby Charlton to burst into the dressing room and tear strips off him, though Ferguson proved more sympathetic on the team coach. O'Brien said: \"I played on ITV against Southampton. Sir Alex Ferguson gave me my debut for Man United down at the Dell.",
      "\"In Ireland, it was the first time I think live football had been on from England, so all my friends and family were watching. I got told to watch out for Mark Dennis in midfield and that he was 'nasty'.",
      "\"I went in for a tackle and Dennis came off worse, I thought it would be a yellow card, back in the day you'd get a caution. Then the ref pulled out the red card after 85 seconds! I went back to the dressing room knowing everybody had been watching at home.",
      "\"It brings you to a dark place and you wonder how things will go for you at a club like Man United. Fergie actually thought I'd insulted the ref.",
      "\"He watched the video back with me on the team bus. But he didn't fine me because he knew it was the wrong decision.",
      "\"All managers have good sides and bad sides. You have to show some type of ruthlessness to be a manager. But Fergie cared about his players first. He was like Keegan and would always back his players.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Thomas Frank met with Sir Jim Ratcliffe in his London garage last spring, before Manchester United cut ties with Erik ten Hag, as per reports. According to TV2, the Danish manager held talks with the Red Devils and Chelsea in May 2024, as both clubs tested the water with new head coaches.",
      "In the morning, it is said that Frank met with Ineos chief Ratcliffe in a London garage, before holding talks with Chelsea in the lavish Mayfair Hotel overlooking Hyde Park. In the end, however, Frank opted to stay on with Brentford for another season, with United appointing Ruben Amorim in the wake of Ten Hag's dismissal in the November, while Chelsea opted to put their faith in Enzo Maresca.",
      "However, Frank told the publication that he was left feeling in awe at the prospect of even speaking with two titans of world football. He explained: \"I know I didn't get either job, but it was still huge.",
      "\"I remember walking through Battersea Park between the two interviews and thinking, 'Thomas Frank from f***ing Frederiksværk - am I really experiencing this?'\"",
      "After a humble playing career with Frederiksværk between 1995 and 2004, Frank transitioned into the world of football management in 2008, taking up tenure with his nation's U16 set-up. From there, he climbed through the ranks to Denmark U17 and U19, before parting ways with the international game to manage Brondby in 2013.",
      "Frank lasted just three years with the club before he resigned after it came about that the club's chairman, Jan Bech Andersen, had been criticising him via an anonymous profile on a fan forum site. A two year break from football then ensued, before he landed a role with Brentford.",
      "A Championship team at the time, Frank led the side to Premier League football in 2021 as a result of winning the play-off final with a convincing 2-0 triumph of Swansea City.",
      "While many newly-promoted teams have faced relegation the year after achieving promotion as a result of struggling to adapt to top flight football, Frank managed to not only retain Brentford's place in the Premier League in the years that followed, but turned the team into genuine stalwarts - finishing 10th last term.",
      "However, the 52-year-old's time at the Gtech Community Stadium drew to a close this summer. Frank found himself linked with taking up tenure with Tottenham soon after the departure of Ange Postecoglou, before he was finally unveiled as the club's new head coach on June 12.",
      "Despite Spurs suffering a 17th-place finish in the Premier League last season under Postecoglou, it appears as though the club is now breathing a new lease of life under Frank's reign. As it stands, the Lilywhites currently sit fifth in the league table after 11 matches, with five wins, three draws and three losses to show for their efforts.",
      "They are also unbeaten in Europe at present, with wins over Villarreal and Copenhagen, as well as draws with Bodo/Glimt to their name in the Champions League. Frank and his side will hope to pick up where they left off when Premier League action returns next weekend, although there may be a titan task awaiting them.",
      "That's because Spurs next face Mikel Arteta's Arsenal on Sunday, November 23. The Gunners currently occupy first-place in the league standings, eight points clear of Tottenham and unbeaten in their last eight top flight outings.",

      "The Cameroon international scored in two of United's three wins. It took him just two minutes to score against Liverpool at Anfield and then notched a brace in the 4-2 win over Brighton. His efforts have now earned individual recognition and he becomes the second United player to win the award in 2025 - following Bruno Fernandes.",
      "But take a look down the list of names to excel in a Premier League month and you'll see some rogue names - some of whom had very short periods in the sun.",
      "Yes across the competitions history there's been several multiple winners. Sergio Aguero, Harry Kane and Mo Salah have claimed it seven times. Cristiano Ronaldo and Steven Gerrard six.",
      "It was a short stint in the Covid-impacted season that basically earned the Newcastle ace his move to St James' Park following a stellar loan stint from Arsenal. The midfielder turned into a goal-getting machine - finding the net in seven games on the bounce when he played. His run began in April and kept going until the end of the season with his goals helping the Magpies to win four of their final seven games.",
      "Once upon a time he was banging on the door to be England's goalkeeper - and that was owing to some of the form he showed whilst at Southampton. Forster had made a comeback from injury and kept a club record six consecutive clean sheets for the Saints - three of which - against Arsenal, West Ham and Swansea - fell in February to secure seven points.",
      "He had quite the purple patch and it helped West Ham secure a memorable win over Manchester City at Upton Park.

Sakho's header against City proving the match-winner as they edged out the champions 2-1.",

They got him four years later after he opted to join Barcelona instead, but he did begin with a bang. Deco masterminded a 4-0 win over Portsmouth on the opening day - scoring a cracker. He also came up with the match winner against Wigan a week later - but that would be as good as his Chelsea career got.",

The Finnish frontman enjoyed the season of his career in 2003/04 - scoring 19 times in all competitions as he outscored the likes of Michael Owen. In March he would score six times - which included braces against Middlesbrough and Leeds.",

It's looking increasingly likely Casemiro will have a crucial part to play at the 2026 World Cup, which suggests he was right to turn down a summer reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo.",

The club have the option to activate a 12-month extension to his terms, and Casemiro has been building a compelling argument despite his staggering £350,000-a-week wages.",
      "Media outlets in his homeland have been singing his praises following another outstanding showings for his country, with several now backing him to secure a spot in Ancelotti's squad for next summer's World Cup. According to reports in Brazil, his most recent outing demonstrated he \"has evolved\" at this advanced stage of his career while also emerging as his team's \"main leader\".",
      "\"There is no longer any reason to divide the midfield, as was done in Brazil in recent decades, between the number five, number eight and number 10 shirts,\" read one report in Folha de Sao Paulo. \"They blend together. As [Jurgen] Klopp, former Liverpool coach, said, more important than a good, classic number 10 is recovering the ball closer to the opponent's goal.",
      "\"Even better is having both options, the pressure and the star player, which happens in many teams. There is still room for midfielders who play more centrally and further back, who protect the defence and initiate offensive plays with excellent passes.",
      "\"They are the links between defence and attack. Great teams have this type of player. Casemiro, who has always stood out from midfield back, has evolved and is now a great playmaker.\"",
      "Casemiro, 33, has demonstrated exactly that recently, bagging three goals and one assist across his last four appearances for club and country. Having earned a Brazil recall under Ancelotti following a two-year absence from the Brazil squad, he has offered greater versatility for United compared to his Real Madrid days, transforming his significance at both domestic and international level.",
      "Having established himself as a deep-lying playmaker in Ancelotti's setup, the midfielder looks set to secure a starting berth for the World Cup after his latest outstanding display. This received more plaudits from Globo: \"But it was the creative and attacking players of the Brazilian national team who were the protagonists of last night.",
      "\"Increasingly in sync, Casemiro and Bruno Guimaraes are consolidating themselves as the starting midfield duo for the World Cup. Since Ancelotti's arrival, both have demonstrated a good ability to alternate in chasing down opposing midfielders and participating in the build-up to attacking plays.\"",
      "Correio Braziliense heaped further acclaim by suggesting Ancelotti has discovered his favoured blueprint: \"Casemiro, one of the few remaining players from the last World Cup and the team's main leader alongside Marquinhos, sealed the result. Both goals were scored in the first half, a period in which the Brazilian team was flawless.",
      "\"The presentation suggests that Ancelotti has found a starting line-up. Or at least he's close to it. It's quite likely that the 11 who started the match in the English capital will be at the World Cup. And that some of them will be starters at the World Cup hosted in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has hailed Senne Lammens' performances as \"outstanding\" and has talked up his future having established himself as the new Manchester United No 1.",
      "The Belgian has recently come into the fold having been signed in the summer as an unknown quantity. The goalkeeper has been a problem position for United across several seasons with Andre Onana struggling to convince during his two-year stint.",
      "He was, somewhat surprisingly, allowed to leave on loan and headed to Turkey in the summer. Altay Bayindir had been deputising but he failed to produce and, on deadline day, the club opted to bring in Lammens in an £18million deal from Royal Antwerp.",
      "The Belgian made his debut against Sunderland, keeping a clean sheet, and also helped secure a memorable win over Liverpool with United in the midst of a five-game unbeaten run which has seen them climb the table.",
      "Ferguson told Raceday RTV: \"Well, they are, the signs… the manager has had some good signs. Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they’ve added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success. The signs are getting better. I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they are enjoying it now.\"",
      "Lammens had made just 52 appearances in the Belgian Pro League before his move to the Premier League, but Amorim has shown huge faith in the 23-year-old who has looked an assured presence at the back.",
      "Ferguson himself could rely on two stellar goalkeepers during his trophy-laden stint. Peter Schmeichel proved to be an inspired signing when he arrived on English shores and Edwin van der Sar was the cornerstone of his success in the later years.",
      "It was the Scot who signed David de Gea shortly before his retirement in 2013. The Spaniard was the team's No 1 for more than a decade, winning a record four Player of the Year awards, but he was allowed to leave in 2023 when his contract came to an end with Onana bought in as his replacement.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Borussia Dortmund sensation Karim Adeyemi has already revealed to Manchester United his preferred role with a thrilling declaration about how he flourishes in the final third. The Munich-born ace's future remains clouded in doubt with reports from Germany indicating that Ruben Amorim could be poised to pounce for the emerging talent.",
      "The 23-year-old, who has previously been linked with Liverpool, ranks among Europe's most exciting prospects and has already collected 11 caps for Germany on the international stage, so it comes as little shock that United are keen on securing his signature. His displays this campaign, though, have been rather disappointing.",
      "Adeyemi has managed to avoid finding the net or providing an assist since late September and has suffered a very public row with boss Niko Kovac.",
      "Should United manage to land Adeyemi, he would bring considerable attacking threat to their forward line, which already features the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The rapid winger has been timed covering 30 metres in a blistering 3.6 seconds, outpacing even Usain Bolt's 3.78 record and establishing him amongst the swiftest players in world football.",
      "He is the official fourth-fastest player in Bundesliga history, clocking 22.77mph in a win over Freiburg in the 2022/2023 season, with the pace earning him a goal in the process. The fastest-ever is Jean-Mattéo Bahoya, who came in at a stunning 23.09mph last season, eclipsing Sirlord Conteh's record which was set in the very same campaign.",
      "\"I think I can play in almost any position in the offensive line,\" he said. \"But right now I am thinking as a winger.\"",
      "Adeyemi then disclosed where he excels most during match situations, adding: \"I think to get on the nerves of the defenders all the time with one-against-one or runs behind the defenders. Being there where the defender cannot see me. Getting assists, getting goals. This, I think, is my game.\"",
      "On his electric pace, he added in the interview that he doesn't think any footballer could get close to him on the field when it comes to raw gas. He also denied a suggestion he could take part in the 2024 Olympic Games.",
      "His dispute with manager Kovac originated from an incident late last month, when Adeyemi hurled a water bottle in the direction of the dugout following his substitution.",
      "Kovac subsequently criticised Adeyemi's behaviour publicly, describing it as \"unnecessary\". During Dortmund's 1-1 draw with Hamburg last weekend, Kovac seemed frustrated with Adeyemi's performance and withdrew him after 66 minutes.",
      "Reports from Bild suggest talks regarding the winger's future have already commenced. With two years remaining on his existing deal, his representatives are allegedly seeking a lengthy contract extension alongside a £70million buyout clause.",
      "Adeyemi's ascent through football's ranks has been extraordinary to witness, with his progression spanning numerous years despite his tender age. In 2019, he claimed Germany's Fritz-Walter Medal as the nation's most promising under-17 talent.",
      "During that period at Red Bull Salzburg, he contributed one goal and four assists across just 12 appearances, helping secure the coveted honour.",
      "Adeyemi subsequently netted nine times whilst providing 12 assists the following campaign, before registering an impressive 23 goals and nine assists in the season after that. He then secured his switch to Dortmund for the 2022/2023 season and received his maiden international call-up.",
      "The Bundesliga have drawn parallels between him and Liverpool icon Mohamed Salah.",
      "\"Both goalscoring left-footers who make magic happen from out wide, there are plenty of similarities,\" reads the Bundesliga's comparison.",
      "\"Both are anti-Lionel Messis when it comes to their dribbling style, using high centre of gravity to trick defenders at speed. If they're not successful with a piece of skill, they tend to win a free kick in a dangerous area. Adeyemi prefers to start off the left to Salah's right, but there are signs that when it comes to entering the opponent's box, BVB's frontman could get even better.\"",

      "Manchester United stars are away with the international break in full flow and they'll return with a match against Everton on their minds. Ruben Amorim's side drew 2-2 with Tottenham before players jetted off to represent their countries.",

      "As Portugal tried to get back in the tie, record goalscorer Ronaldo was shown a red card in the 61st minute for a swinging elbow. Fernandes has come to the defence of the former United forward, but admits this \"mistake\" did cost Portugal.",

      "\"Ireland defended well. We moved the ball too slowly. We need to be quicker and more direct. But we analyse mistakes the same way in wins or losses.\"",
      "Dutchman Matthijs de Ligt has been solid at the back under Amorim this season but it appears Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman does not highly regard him. He has regularly been excluded from teams and squads by Koeman over the last 12 months but was recalled this week.",
      "However, when the Netherlands faced Poland on Friday, De Ligt, signed by United for £40m from Bayern Munich in 2024, was limited to zero minutes from the bench - only adding to his international woes. His side drew 1-1 and Koeman unleashed on his defence, despite not utilising De Ligt.",
      "\"In certain situations, we need to be more patient and improve our defence,\" admitted Koeman after his team's draw on Friday evening.",

Earlier this year, Cantona lambasted the club's owner for stripping United's soul and even dismissed plans for a £2billion 'New Trafford', which Ratcliffe hopes to replace their current M16 home with.",
      "Cantona's view of the British billionaire starkly contrasts with Ratcliffe's opinion of the former United star, who he considers his favourite player. The Ineos founder even named the company that bought up to 29% of United, Trawlers Limited, in reference to his famous speech.",
      "However, Ratcliffe may need to rethink his favourite player following more harsh words from the 59-year-old. During a tour for his one-man show, Cantona seized the chance to criticise the hierarchy once again - referencing failed attempts to collaborate with Ratcliffe and his team.",
      "\"I have many other passions and projects, but I thought that for two or three years I could maybe put those to the side and try to give something to this club, which has given everything to me,\" Cantona told the audience, as reported by Telegraph Sport.",
      "\"But he didn't seem interested. I did what I had to do, so I don't feel guilty anymore. I tried my best.\" Cantona, the Manchester United legend, also criticised the club's owners for abandoning Sir Alex Ferguson's attacking style of football.",
      "He said: \"Sir Alex Ferguson created a style of beautiful attacking football, which the new owners should have used. Instead, they destroyed it.\"",
      "Recently, Cantona's name has been linked with potential investment from the Middle East. Speculation was rife during the October international break when Saudi official Turki Al-Sheikh announced that an investor was on the verge of securing a deal for United.",

United are understood to view Gallagher as an alternative option, whilst Brighton's Carlos Baleba remains their primary midfield target.",
      "However, the Seagulls have reportedly slapped a mammoth £100million valuation on the 21-year-old, which could prove a major stumbling block. Ruben Amorim's squad could make substantial savings by pursuing the ex-Chelsea star instead. Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo recently suggested that Atletico Madrid would entertain bids around the £52m mark.",
      "Former Scotland winger Nevin reckons Gallagher wouldn't merely strengthen Amorim's options, but would also provide crucial support for United captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Speaking to CasinoHawks, he said: \"I think Conor Gallagher would be great at Man Utd, in my opinion. Gallagher can play a number of positions. Remember Gallagher can play in a 3-4-2-1 formation. It wouldn't be the best as one of the wing-backs, but as one of the two in the central four.",
      "\"So you're talking about the two central midfielders or one of the two ahead as well. If you put him in one of the two more holding positions with his energy, his battling, it kind of frees Bruno Fernandes a wee bit to go a bit further forward, because he's been having to come back a few games, hasn't he? Playing in a more defensive place.",
      "\"The energy levels that Connor's got would be perfect which again makes you ask why they sold Scott McTominay.",
      "\"But the other thing about Connor, if you actually have to play him one further forward, there are very few in the game that are better in a high-pressing game.",
      "\"There are very few in football that can do better than him. He's brilliantly suited to the English game.",
      "\"If Manchester United have had a problem for quite some time, one of the biggest problems they've had is energy in midfield. With the best will in the world, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen were lovely players, fantastic world-class players, but they didn't have legs by the end.",
      "\"Certainly Casemiro still hasn't got the legs to do that three games a week. That's clear, that's obvious. So you need somebody in there who's got that. I would be looking at those central positions, to be honest.\"",
      "Gallagher came through Chelsea's academy after joining at six years old and worked his way into the senior squad. He gained experience during four loan spells at Charlton Athletic, Swansea City, West Brom and Crystal Palace before becoming a regular in the Blues' Premier League side.",

      "Fresh developments have surfaced regarding Joshua Zirkzee's prospects at Manchester United as talk intensifies with the January transfer window looming. United brought Zirkzee over from Bologna during the summer of 2024 in a transaction valued at €42.5million (£37.5m).",
      "The Netherlands international arrived at Old Trafford following his acquisition by previous boss Erik ten Hag, though Zirkzee has struggled to secure regular minutes since Ruben Amorim took charge 12 months ago.",
      "Zirkzee has featured in merely five matches for United this season, with four coming in the Premier League, and remains without a goal in the current campaign.",
      "Consequently, persistent rumours have emerged connecting Zirkzee with a potential departure from United when the January market opens.",
      "Nevertheless, The Sun has suggested this scenario is unlikely as Zirkzee appears destined to stay put at Old Trafford. Reports indicate the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of departing United in the New Year.",
      "The publication suggests that the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which is anticipated to result in Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo being unavailable for multiple weeks, is shaping United's January planning.",
      "Zirkzee has reportedly been informed that a January transfer is off the table, with the striker expected to see more action on the pitch in December and January.",
      "Rumours have been swirling for a while now that Zirkzee was eyeing a January exit from United in pursuit of more consistent first-team football, but if recent reports are to be believed, this may not be feasible.",
      "In total, Zirkzee has scored just seven goals for United across his 54 appearances for the club since the start of last season.",
      "United will return to Premier League action after the November international break with a clash against Everton on the Monday after the rest of the league fixtures.",
      "It remains to be seen if Amorim will decide to give Zirkzee any minutes when the top flight resumes this month, with summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo, as well as Amad, often getting the majority of the minutes in the forward line.",

      "Manchester United let down their fanbase last season with poor performances across all competitions.",
      "The Europa League was nearly the saving grace but when push came to shove, the Reds were not the team they needed to be. United were so far away from the levels expected of them that it was hard to see a quick recovery.",
      "And yet here we are in mid-November with United a point off the top-four and five games unbeaten. They are not the finished article but there are clear signs that United are becoming a team who can challenge at the right end of the Premier League.",
      "Speaking to MEN Sport, psychology expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, Dr Martin Turner, believes the turnaround could lie in the mentality of the squad this season.",
      "Dr Turner, who has worked alongside The FA and Scarlets Rugby, said: \"It is so important when we talk about experienced players, it is not just because they have kicked a ball more times than the player next to them, but they have gone through the peaks and troughs of football. They have been under pressure, they have succeeded, they have failed, and they have become psychologically robust to the different ups and downs of the sport.",
      "\"That is part of the reason why experience really counts because through facing difficulty you grow and develop and learn to be a bit more robust. So it is partly about time, particularly with Manchester United and the amount of change that has taken place over a short period of time, which we know can be stressful and taxing, [but] over time those players will start to acclimatise to that and become more robust.\"",
      "When asked if the recruitment of players like Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who have proven Premier League quality, while keeping players who experienced the lows of last season and overcome them, is leading to improved performances this season, Dr Turner replied: \"Yes, exactly they are just able to weather those storms a little better.",
      "\"They have less psychological peaks and troughs. After a good game, they will feel pretty good but they won’t get carried away with it and after a bad game, they would feel pretty bad but it wouldn’t be the end of the world for them. They learn to take success and failure in their stride because they have succeeded and failed so often.",
      "\"When you look at the world’s best performers, it is not just that they succeed all the time, they are able to recognise that when they do fail, it is a temporary thing and they know that they will come back and bounce back. That is hard for a less experienced player to realise because they haven’t had the psychological experience of those successes and failures. Sometimes it takes failure at the biggest stage to do some of that too.\"",
      "Next Monday, United return to the Premier League when they host Everton at Old Trafford. Should they avoid defeat, they will be six games unbeaten. However, the lingering worry for United is that tiredness could start to creep in despite playing fewer matches this season.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt spoke after the Tottenham game about the team feeling tired in the second half of matches and Dr Turner believes that the mental challenges of competing in the Premier League are contributing to that.",
      "\"The brain is using largely the same energy system as the body, people forget that the brain is in the body,\" he said.",
      "\"It feels like it is this separate thing because we talk about mind and body but they are obviously part of the same body so they are using the same energy. We know that it is actually quite difficult for people in high pressured situations, tough jobs, like being an athlete, and that can be exhausting.",
      "\"Not just the physical stuff but dealing with the emotions every day, dealing with expectation, dealing with the social aspect of being involved in sport at a high level, it can actually make you mentally exhausted and it can have an impact on your physical exhaustion because the energy is coming from the same space. So it is about developing this resistance and robustness over time to these kinds of things which is where experienced players come in.\"",

      "When England faced the Netherlands for a place in the European Championship finals 18 months ago, two Manchester United stars were dreaming of international glory. Now they’re facing a transfer conundrum to try and save their World Cup dream.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirzkee are both in the international wilderness just now with game time for Manchester United in short supply.",
      "Mainoo was something of a breakout star for England in their run to the final of Euro 2024 and seemed to have a central midfield position under lock and key for years to come for club and country. Under two years later and the 20-year-old has fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim and will need a January move and a stunning run of form to offer any hope of a late run into Thomas Tuchel’s England thinking.",
      "Mainoo’s stuttering career is puzzling to plenty and while Amorim has offered words of encouragement, they haven’t translated into meaningful minutes.",
      "And even though he is on the fringes of things at Old Trafford, United are unlikely to sanction a temporary move away for the youngster given he is a regular in matchday squads.",
      "It’s a similar story for Zirkzee, who came off the bench for the Netherlands against England in that semi-final but can’t get off it for United this season.",
      "He’s been used sparingly by Amorim and even the injury to sole centre forward Benjamin Sesko doesn’t look like yielding many minutes for the Dutchman.",
      "He has been left out of the recent international squads and with Ronald Koeman’s side all but assured a place in the World Cup, Zirkzee must surely move if he is to join his countrymen in North America.",
      "But again United are not certain to offload the 24-year-old particularly given Sesko’s injury, even if Amorim suggested the club might look to add an attacking option in January.",
      "Zirkzee and Mainoo are set to remain on the outside looking in, just as they will be in the summer come the World Cup.",

      "Just 44 goals. That is the measly sum Manchester United managed to conjure up last season in the Premier League.",
      "To put that into perspective, only the bottom three and Everton scored fewer goals in the top flight. No wonder United were left hovering above the relegation zone.",
      "It was United's major failing and while the argument can be made that the league was sacrificed towards the end of the campaign for the Europa League, goals were an issue when the Reds were taking it seriously. On just 12 occasions out of 38 Premier League matches last season did United score twice or more in a single game.",
      "This includes the times when even that was not enough to secure the three points - like against Brentford and Everton away where the Reds. Compare that to this season, and already the figures are looking brighter.",
      "Only 11 Premier League matches in and United have scored two or more goals in seven games and they have not yet lost after scoring on multiple occasions in a single match. So what could be behind this up turn in form?",
      "Well, the inclusion of Bryan Mbeumo into the starting XI has helped but there is also a secret weapon starting to take pressure off the forward line. His name is Casemiro.",
      "The Brazilian is not known for his goalscoring pedigree. As a defensive midfielder, he hasn't been expected to chip in with goals and his best goalscoring seasons were when he bagged seven in 2020/21 for Real Madrid and matched that tally in his debut campaign with United.",
      "Yet this campaign has seen him score three goals already, easily swamping his record in the 2024/25 Premier League. He scored five in the entirety of last season which included a brace against a hapless Leicester City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Casemiro currently finds himself as United's second top scorer at the club and this could be because of a change in style that we are seeing Ruben Amorim and the rest of the Premier League employ. MEN Sport have spoken previously about the danger the midfielder poses from set pieces.",
      "Apart from his goal against Brighton, which even he will admit was fortuitous, Casemiro has scored either directly or indirectly from a set piece. Against Chelsea, the goal came as the away side failed to deal with a short corner routine which the Brazilian eventually nodded in.",
      "At Nottingham Forest, he headed home from a corner and during this weekend's international friendly against Senegal at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, he showed great composure from a Rodrygo free kick to add another goal. Casemiro is quickly becoming a danger man from dead ball scenarios for both club and country and that can only be a good thing for United.",
      "Lots could be made of Rasmus Hojlund's lack of goals last season, but it should not be solely down to the centre-forward to be scoring. Goals need to be coming from all over the park and that is what Casemiro is starting to do.",
      "United are no longer so one-dimensional in their attack. Just ten different players scored in the Premier League for the Reds last season, now there is already nine different goalscorers.",
      "Casemiro is the secret weapon though, leading the way for others to chip in with goals in the Premier League this season.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United's struggle for goals last season saw them turn to the perilous field of the January transfer market.",
      "Their two senior striker options, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, had mustered just five league goals between them as the final knockings of the mid-season window approached. Mathys Tel and Christopher Nkunku were considered as emergency options to sharpen one of the league's bluntest attacks, but ultimately United stuck with the misfiring Hojlund and Zirkzee.",
      "Two league goals for Hojlund in the second half of the campaign and none for Zirkzee, alongside an abysmal 15th-placed finish and no silverware added to the cabinet, would suggest United were wrong not to sign a striker in January. But the truth is neither Tel nor Nkunku were the answer.",
      "Tel bagged a January loan move to Spurs and notched just two league goals. He would go on to secure a permanent £30million move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and his haul of four league goals for the club in nearly a year is hardly eye-watering stuff - albeit one of those strikes did deny United a win at Spurs earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, Nkunku scored just one Premier League goal in the second half of the 2024/25 season before swapping Chelsea for AC Milan in a £36m deal in the summer. His Serie A tally for the Italian giants currently stands at zero.",
      "Neither striker would have helped United salvage something from a disastrous campaign, and neither would have been able to provide the focal point Ruben Amorim's system requires. Say what you like about Benjamin Sesko, he is a physical presence and in time could become the foil Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha need to go up yet another gear at Old Trafford.",
      "United were right to avoid the £66m pair last January, and they may need to hold their nerve yet again in a few months' time.",
      "Sesko has shown signs of promise but is still adapting to life in England, while Zirkzee is understood to want out of Old Trafford in a bid to reignite his World Cup dream.",
      "United are said to have no interest in allowing Zirkzee to move on in January, and it's a stance they must stick by. For all his flaws, Zirkzee has shown himself to be a useful squad player at times. He is not good enough to challenge for a place in the first team and should be moved on next summer, but midway through a season isn't the time to go cutting ties with one of your two senior striker options before desperately searching for a player who will need time to settle in and could cost a small fortune.",
      "With the likes of Mbeumo and Cunha adding to United's attacking threat, Amorim has goals all over the pitch and doesn't need his strikers to be hitting 25 goals a season, although if United are to challenge for titles of course Sesko will eventually need to reach that point.",
      "Nineteen goals in 11 league games is no bad record. There is no need for unnecessary upheaval in the January transfer window.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "Hello and welcome to today's live Manchester United blog, keeping you on top of the latest transfer news and rumours from Old Trafford.",
      "It's not too long now until the January transfer window opens and there continues to be talk of potential imcomings and outgoings as plans for the window are put into place.",
      "One player who has been linked with a move away from United is midfielder Kobbie Mainoo. The academy graduate has struggled for game time this season and Napoli are the team said to be showing the most interest in a potential deal.",
      "It's in the middle where Ruben Amorim is most likely to strengthen in the next couple of transfer windows. Several names have been linked including Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba.",
      "But it's not only in central midfield where United could strengthen as Amorim may look at other areas too. Another player to be linked over the last few days include Borussia Dortmund winger Karim Adeyemi.",
      "With the return of the Premier League on the horizon, Amorim will be preparing his team for the home clash against Everton which takes place in one week. Ahead of that game, United sit in seventh place in the table, but are just one point from the top four.",
      "Follow along below for all the latest United transfer news, rumours and updates.",
      "United striker Joshua Zirkzee has 'made it clear' that he is interested in joining Roma in the January transfer window, according to reports in Italy.",
      "Corriere dello Sport report that Zirkzee is 'top of the list 'when it comes to Roma's search for a striker.",
      "The repor adds that the player himself is open to the move, due to a chance of starying games more reguarly and therefre increasing his chance of making the Netherlands squad for the summer's World Cup.",
      "Manchester United are one of five clubs keeping an eye on the situation over the future of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, according to reports.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport name United alongside Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, Tottenham and Barcelona as club 'keeping their eyes peeled'.",
      "The striker is out of contract with Juve next summer, and is yet to agree a new deal. It is said that he will have to take a wage cut of around half if he was to sign a new contract with the Italian giants.",
      "Barcelona have made their feelings clear on Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford.",
      "The forward was sent out to Catalonia on a season-long loan after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds' head coach Ruben Amorim. The La Liga giants have the option to make his move permanent for £28 million in 2026, with reports from Sport suggesting Barca are already working to \"outline an agreement\" with United.",
      "Rashford has impressed so far in Spain with six goals and nine assists across all competitions in a Barcelona shirt. The 28-year-old has the most assists of any player in Europe's top five leagues.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "Roma are in talks with United over a deal for Joshua Zirkzee, according to reports in Italy.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport report that talks are underway over a loan deal with an option to buy. It is added that it is hoped that a deal can be done early in the transfer window.",
      "It's reportsd that the buy option in any deal will 'not be less' than €35 million (£30.8m). Roma will reportedly pay half of Zirkzee's wages during the loan spell, although discussions are yet to be finalised.",
      "Mason Greenwood has been named Ligue 1's Player of the Month shortly amid reports linking the 24-year-old with a return to the England national team.",
      "Greenwood won the award for October. The former Manchester United forward scored five goals during the month, with four of those coming in Marseille’s 6-2 victory over Le Havre. He also found the net against Lens in a 2-1 defeat.",
      "The youngster has scored nine times this season and provided four assists in 15 appearances. His numbers last year were impressive too, with Greenwood tying PSG’s Ousmane Dembele for the French Golden Boot with 21 league goals.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "Manchester United's official Instagram account have made their feelings on Joshua Zirkzee clear amid links with a move away from the club.",
      "The striker has sturggled to make an impact at Old Trafford since his arrival last summer. He has been linked with a January deal to AS Roma.",
      "Amid the speculation, United have used the player as part of their marketing for the United store.",
      "They have posted a picture of Zirkzee in official merchandise, along with a caption that simpy reads: \"Josh\".",
      "A move for Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba is likely to be reignited next summer, according to journalist Fabrizio Romano.",
      "United were first linked with an interest last summer, with the player said to be keen to make a move.",
      "While the January window is coming up, it's said that a move then is unlikely with eyes instead on summer 2026.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano has said:",
      "“It was August, here on the channel. I told you, Man United want Carlos Baleba. Baleba wants to go to Man United. The conversation with the player and his agents was very good, but Brighton, at that time in August, didn't want to sell the player.",
      "“In January it’s likely to be a difficult deal, the Baleba one, because Brighton insist on not selling the player.",
      "“But for the summer, unless the stance changes for January, we have to see what happens, but for the summer, let's say for 2026, for sure, Manchester United see Carlos Baleba as a priority target.",
      "“I gave you a video last summer saying Baleba will remain a target if the deal doesn't happen now. Man United want to insist on the deal in 2026.",
      "“And that remains the case. Man United still want Baleba. Baleba is still very keen on a move to Manchester United, even more so now they are doing very well in the Premier League.”",
      "Reported United transfer target made his first start for England in the 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Albania on sunday evening.",
      "The Crystal Palace man played 75 minutes of the game before being replaced by Elliot Anderson - who has also been linked with the club.",
      "Former United captain Roy Keane delivered his verdict on Wharton's performance.",
      "Speaking on ITV, he said:",
      "\"I do like Adam Wharton. A lot of the modern midfielders, their first option seems to be 'can I go sideways or backwards?'",
      "\"What I like about him, the first option he seems to look at it is 'can I pass it forward?' and that's a big strength to have.",
      "\"This is where he can mature over the next year or two if he's playing at the top level, put demands onto people. He's a bit soft there. Shout at players, go \"give me the ball!\". That's what I used to do, I used to fall out with people a lot. \"Give me the ball!\" Put demands on your team-mates.",
      "\"He's still new to it, so I'm not going to be too harsh on him. But as he matures and starts playing more games, put demands on your team-mates.\"",
      "Napoli are the team to be heavily linked with an interest in United academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo this summer, but the Italian club have now been linked with a potential alternative.",
      "According to CalcioNapoli24, Quinten Timber, the brother of Arsenal's Jurrien Timber, has emerged as a target as the Serie A club looks to cover for injuries to Frank Zambo Anguissa and Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Timber will have just six months remaining on his contract with Feyenoord when the January window opens, while the Dutch side are keen to get him tied down to a new deal, an agreement is yet to be reached, opening up the possibility of a January move.",

      "United will provide coaches to ferry supporters between the stadium and the training ground.",
      "During the Carrington tour, fans will get a glimpse of the swimming pool, cafeteria, recovery areas and press conference room, but photos will not be permitted.",
      "The tours will cost £100 for adults, Over 65s and Under-16s. They are currently scheduled to take place across three days in June while the 2026 World Cup is ongoing in the United States.",
      "The tours will be across 15-minute intervals - the first starts at 10am and last at 2:45pm.",
      "United advertised the tours on their website, writing: \"For the first time ever, Manchester United is opening the gates to Carrington and allowing fans the ultimate glimpse behind the curtain.",
      "\"Our leading-edge training ground was reopened in August following an extensive renovation process that made it one of the world’s best sporting facilities.",
      "\"Supporters can follow in the footsteps of our squads and learn how players prepare for matchdays by enjoying an exclusive guided tour of Carrington.",
      "\"These unmissable training-ground experiences are due to take place during the off season in June and July 2026, and places are understandably limited. Priced at £100, the package will begin with an all-access tour of Old Trafford, including the dressing rooms, tunnel, Museum and Megastore.",
      "\"Fans will then board a club coach to Carrington to see the inner sanctum of United's day-to-day home. Supporters will visit the state-of-the-art dressing room, gym, swimming pools, recovery areas, press conference room, media studios and players' lounge.",
      "\"As stated, places on our first-ever tours of Carrington are limited to please act quickly to avoid disappointment.\"",
      "When the Carrington refurbishment was unveiled in August, Sir Jim Ratcliffe said: “Everyone in the world knows the Manchester United brand, so with those two things the club has to compete at the highest level, that’s appropriate to the brand and the size and the history of the club.",
      "“While a world-class facility won’t take us to that place alone, I think it is one of the key ingredients in the modern world. I think here now we have a world-class training facility.",
      "“When we first arrived, two years ago, I came to Carrington and we had a nice presentation here. It’s an excellent facility and I’m sure it was in the year 2000 but 25 years later it wasn’t quite what it needed to be for the top four or five teams in Europe.",
      "“It was pretty much the first big decision we made when we arrived, in the first quarter of 2024, to invest in this training facility. There were lots of naysayers around, who said you’re not going to do that within 12 months, it’s going to be a mess.",
      "\"But I’m quite pleased to say that it’s come in on budget, on time and we’ve managed to operate all the teams here in reduced facilities but we made it work in that 12-month period.”",
      "United have been working within the constraints of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). The failure to qualify for European football has impacted revenue this season, and Carrington tours will raise cash.",

      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September.",
      "Young goalkeeper Will Brook came into the side and helped Shrewsbury to their first win of the season. Harrison started the two matches upon his return, but Brook was recalled and has kept his place since, which saw him pick up the Shrewsbury Player of the Month award for October.",
      "Last Saturday, Shrewsbury moved out of the League Two relegation zone thanks to a 1-0 win against Newport County, in which Brook kept his fourth clean sheet in his eighth league start.",
      "The 22-year-old was released by Nottingham Forest in the summer. Shrewsbury boss Michael Appleton said Brook had been signed to challenge Harrison, but he has become first choice.",
      "Speaking about the competition with United loanee Harrison, Brook told the BBC: \"We've got a good relationship. We really push each other. It's up to the gaffer who starts and it's never guaranteed but I'm trying to work week in, week out to make sure he keeps his trust in me.\"",
      "United are following Harrison's situation at The Croud Meadow. The young stopper is highly regarded and Shrewsbury landed his signature due to their game time assurances.",
      "Almost every academy player who leaves United on loan has a recall break clause that can be activated after six months, which gives a chance to assess whether it's best for the youngster to stay on loan.",
      "Brook signed for National League North side Leamington Spa on a part-time contract before signing for Shrewsbury. He had also taken the first steps to becoming a labourer for his father's building business.",
      "He added: \"I got a call from my agent saying 'Shrewsbury want you to go down' so I went, signed on a Friday and was on the bench Saturday - it was a quick as that.",

      "Manchester United are said to have agreed to launching a team that will compete in basketball.",
      "President of the Italian Basketball Federation Gianni Petrucci has claimed that United have ‘said yes’ to participation in NBA Europe.",
      "The plans will see major European cities, including Manchester, to be the host of 10 or 12 founding franchises. It aims to cash in on the growth of basketball outside of America and in Europe.",
      "In an interview with Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport, Petrucci said: “It’s a new league that will be good for the system, bringing resources and entertainment. The agreement also notes that registered clubs must participate in their respective domestic leagues.”",
      "He added: “In a $50 billion (£37.9bn) market, European basketball has a commercial value of just $200 million (£152m). An NBA league is precisely the opportunity to increase competitiveness and expand the pool.",
      "“If Manchester United, the most popular football team in the world, has already said yes, there must be a reason.”",
      "A potential launch date for NBA Europe has been earmarked as the start of the 2027/28 season.",
      "The claim comes with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe searching for more revenue streams to bring more money into the club. Back in September, the club’s finances showed a record revenue for last year, despite the club continuing to lose money.",
      "Should the plans go ahead, it’s not the first time that the club have owned a basketball team. In the 1980s, Manchester United basketball side won a league championship and were watched by crowds of around 1,500 at Stretford Sports Centre.",
      "The team faces the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid in their matches. But the franchise didn’t last too long.",
      "In 1988 they were bought by a group of local businessmen with the name changed to Manchester Eagles and then Manchester Giants following a merger with Olympic City Giants.",
      "The current team ae called Manchester Basketball and were established in 2024, following the collapse of the British Basketball League and Manchester Giants.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Karim Adeyemi was in Manchester just last week. The forward has been linked with a move to Manchester United in recent days but it was at the other end of the city where he caught the eye.",
      "Borussia Dortmund were ultimately well beaten by Manchester City in the Champions League but Adeyemi was the bright spark for the German visitors, consistently asking questions of the home defence and playing his part in a Dortmund revival as the Bundesliga outfit briefly threatened a comeback from three down before losing 4-1.",
      "It's not the first eye-catching European display from the 23-year-old this season with Adeyemi, reportedly valued at around £70million, having netted in the 4-4 with Juventus in September.",
      "Adeyemi is capable of playing through the middle or on either side, and in many ways is the modern forward who is direct and skilful with an eye for goal and the versatility to play across the frontline.",
      "He's long been touted as a star of the future and at times this season has looked like he is making good on that potential.",
      "Dortmund Sporting Director Sebastian Kehl, speaking after Adeyemi starred in a win over Wolfsburg earlier this term, said: \"(Karim) exudes a certain kind of relaxed attitude, professionalism, but also a winning mentality. At the moment, he's probably the best Karim Adeyemi we've seen here at Borussia Dortmund.\"",
      "The Germany international has only managed three goals this season and is under contract at Dortmund until 2027, with reports suggesting he wants a release clause included in any new deal.",
      "Adeyemi is a player who thrives when running at defenders and has a thirst to improve his numbers, with goals and assists key to the way he plays. He's grown in stature at Dortmund since arriving in 2022 from RB Salzburg, following a path trodden by Erling Haaland.",
      "Having been at Bayern Munich as a young player, he was plucked from the second tier of German Under-19 football to join Salzburg. And the man recognised as spotting the untapped talent? Christopher Vivell - now head of recruitment at Old Trafford but then a scout within the Red Bull system.",
      "The established connection between the pair would likely be a lure for Adeyemi if the reported interest from United were to be firmed up. Adeyemi was overlooked for the most recent Germany squad but did feature in October and has one goal from 11 caps for his country.",
      "He first made his debut four years ago, while still at Salzburg, with his decision to move to Austria vindicated by regular football at a young age and European experience.",
      "\"The most important thing for a young guy is to play,\" he said, speaking in 2023 of his decision to join RB Salzburg. \"They have a second team who play against adults. I played in the second league as a 16-year-old, a lot of games. I adapted to men's football and this is what is important for a young player.",
      "\"If you develop you can play in the first team of Salzburg and they play Champions League or Europa League. That is a great thing for a young player and you learn a lot. There are really good players in Salzburg and, for me, it was the best move that I could do.\"",
      "That move came about in part because of Vivell. Maybe the United chief will have a say in his next transfer as well.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "“He’s a player with extraordinary qualities. He can play anywhere on the pitch, he’s special. He can play as a midfielder, or as a defender,\" said Carlo Ancelotti of Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "Camavinga is supremely talented and he was on Manchester United's radar before he signed for Real Madrid, so perhaps United should reignite their interest at the end of the season.",
      "You were probably tempted to close the article after reading that sentence. \"Why would a Madrid player join United?\" you likely thought. It may seem unlikely, but stranger things have happened in football.",
      "Camavinga has slotted back into Madrid's team after recovering from an ankle injury, starting three games, but he was back on the bench for the 4-0 victory against Valencia at the Bernabeu.",
      "A move for Camavinga would be ambitious. It's not rocket science to work out that he is at the best club to lift major honours, although Madrid may consider parting ways with Camavinga if the money is right. Every player has a price in football. Nobody is outright not for sale.",
      "United were interested in signing Carlos Baleba from Brighton in the summer transfer window. Brighton value Baleba in excess of £100million and that valuation won't change much by next summer.",
      "Yes, a move for Camavinga seems unlikely, but it would make sense to make an offer to Madrid before potentially spending a similar fee on Baleba, who is not on the same level.",
      "If United are prepared to commit a package worth around £80m to £90m for a midfield signing, they should test Madrid's resolve for a dream target before turning to someone like Baleba.",
      "What have United got to lose? You miss all the shots you don't take. United were first interested in Camavinga in 2021 when he was at Rennes and had entered the final year of his contract.",
      "The argument to at least consider sending an enquiry about Camavinga is essentially based on Baleba not being worth the fee Brighton valued him at. The 21-year-old failed in his audition at Old Trafford last month and he hasn't looked like a £50m player, never mind a £100m player.",
      "Baleba was substituted at half-time against Everton in August, and he didn't look like the midfielder who caught United's attention last season when he came off the bench against Bournemouth in September.",
      "Speaking after Bournemouth, Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler admitted he was struggling. \"I think it’s normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s not easy for this player to handle it. Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",
      "\"But he’s a young player and I think that’s something we have to accept, that young players don’t always have the face we want to see. It’s our responsibility to help them in the right moments.\"",
      "When asked specifically if the interest from United had affected the midfielder, the Brighton boss added: \"I think everyone gets affected, especially when you are that young and you hear these kinds of things, no matter if they are wrong or right. But it’s just noise we don’t need.\"",
      "Baleba must improve and put an underwhelming start to the campaign behind him if he wants to earn a move to Old Trafford. United must consider other options in the meantime, including ambitious targets.",

      "Manchester United may be closing in on a solution to a long-standing squad issue, with one player calling a move to Old Trafford a \"dream come true.\" Ruben Amorim's recent transfer activity has had a positive impact at United, so much so that Sir Alex Ferguson has publicly praised one particular signing.",
      "While United's fall from grace in recent years has seen the club struggle to attract certain elite stars, the well is evidently not dry. And there are even those willing to publicly campaign for their transfers, suggesting a move could happen as soon as January.",
      "It remains unclear how active United will be in the upcoming January transfer window. However, recent developments suggest a promising outlook as we delve deeper into winter, and MEN Sport breaks down all the latest happenings around the club.",
      "Crystal Palace full-back Daniel Munoz has expressed his desire to potentially sign for Amorim, saying it would be a \"dream come true\" to play for United. The Colombian is having an excellent second season at Selhurst Park and recently included United in his list of preferred transfer destinations.",
      "\"First of all, I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another,\" he told AS. \"If you ask me, it would be a dream come true to play for one of these clubs, whether it's Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.\"",
      "This statement leaves no doubt the player would be open to a transfer enquiry. And given United's struggle to fill the right wing-back position as required by Amorim's system, Munoz could be the perfect addition.",
      "Amad is presently occupying the role, whilst Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot have provided cover in that area when available. Even before Amorim's appointment, questions were being raised about whether the right flank of the defence possessed the necessary quality.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that [a big transfer],\" added Munoz before suggesting he would be receptive to a January move. \"I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because it's a dream of mine to get there.",
      "\"Right now I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. If you ask me, I don't have any concrete information that any of these clubs are interested in me. My focus is on Crystal Palace; we'll see when the winter transfer window gets closer. Right now, I'm fully focused on these two matches with the national team.\"",
      "Among the wave of new arrivals who joined Old Trafford during the summer window, players such as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha emerge as particularly noteworthy additions. The duo were part of a £200million offensive overhaul that also included Benjamin Sesko, with supporters expressing considerable satisfaction with their contributions thus far.",
      "Nevertheless, Ferguson's focus was drawn to the other end of the pitch when discussing the new arrival who has made the most significant impact. And the United legend has been delighted by the transformative influence Senne Lammens has brought after United signed him from Royal Antwerp in an £18.2m deal.",
      "\"There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,\" he told Raceday RTV. \"Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he's only played three or four games and he's looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they've added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - the signs are getting better.",
      "\"I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they'll enjoy it now.\"",
      "Andre Onana failed to inspire between the posts before he was sent out on loan to Trabzonspor this season. And the last-minute deal to add Lammens to their ranks looks like a gamble that's paying off thus far.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Mary Earps, rightly or wrongly, has dominated the headlines, and everyone was waiting to see how the night unfurled. When she emerged from the tunnel at Old Trafford, she received a rapturous reception from the early birds in the stadium.",
      "It was not a given, but was perhaps to be expected. What was not in the script was the boos that rung out every time she touched the ball in the game.",
      "To their credit, the United fans aimed to drown out the boos with cheers and, by the end, Earps had won them round. But thanks to their performance on the pitch, the Reds changed the narrative.",
      "Instead of talking about Earps, the main takeaway from last night's game was the performances of the players in red. Safia Middleton-Patel who managed to overcome the nerves of replacing Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who suffered a facial injury against Aston Villa, produced a decent display to help win the game.",
      "Her save at the start of the second half was top draw and one which United keepers of all codes would have been proud of. Melvine Malard, before being forced off with cramp, was superb leading the line and left Earps with no chance as she curled the ball beyond the former England No.1.",
      "Jayde Riviere was dynamic at right-back and her last-ditch tackles helped keep PSG at bay as they pushed for an equaliser. Jess Park did superbly well for the winner, linking up play with neat one-twos before Anna Sandberg crossed for Fridolina Rolfo to win the match.",
      "Earps may have dominated the build-up to this fixture, but it will be the United players who will be remembered when we look back at this game at the end of the season. United now sit third in the Champions League table, with women's powerhouses Barcelona and Lyon the only other teams to have 100% starts to the competition.",
      "Marc Skinner was beaming in his post-match press conference and he had every right to be. This United team has really gelled and you now have to wonder just how far they can go in both the Women's Super League and the Champions League.",

      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism [about his condition] anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "On his return to the Netherlands squad after being overlooked last month, the defender added: “If you’re not in the squad, it affects you. But the national coach decides. For me, it was important to stay true to myself and keep going. I think being selected again is a victory.\"",
      "Earlier in the week, Netherlands manager Koeman explained De Ligt's recall, saying: \"He didn't look confident in his play, and I told him so. He's calmer now, and I felt I should include him again.\"",
      "De Ligt was not included in the United leadership group that was introduced in the summer, but boss Ruben Amorim said the Dutchman leads by example when he spoke during his post-Spurs press conference.",
      "\"We choose. Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play, then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other. I think he is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well. I think he has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball.",
      "\"He is doing that really well because that is a smart thing for a player. But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",

      "Former Manchester United and England goalkeeper Mary Earps was cheered by fans as she made her way out on to the pitch for Paris Saint-Germain's warm-up, before the goalkeeper was subject to a smattering of boos during the early stages of the Champions League match.",
      "Earps returned to Old Trafford for the first time this evening after leaving the club for the Parisians - in June 2024. The 32-year-old has made headlines in the past few weeks following the release of her book; 'All In'.",
      "An excerpt from that book caused controversy as she discussed a conversation she had with England head coach Sarina Wiegman about Chelsea star Hannah Hampton. It was claimed in the book that the goalkeeper, who helped England win Euro 2025, was criticised by Earps prior to the tournament.",
      "Earps alleged that Hampton was 'disruptive and unreliable' during Euro 2022 and is believed to have told Wiegman that the Dutch head coach was 'rewarding bad behaviour' by calling up the 24-year-old thereafter. These allegations were met with backlash from England fans and Earps has since spoken out to defend her comments.",
      "In a statement on Instagram following backlash, Earps said: \"It is not easy to be as vulnerable and open as I have been in the book, and I also understand that my honesty and rawness will divide opinion. That's okay, everyone is entitled to feel what they feel and I respect that.\"",
      "Speaking prior to the match, the goalkeeper admitted she expected a frosty reception at Old Trafford. That's not what played out on the night, at least pre-match, but Earps was booed when she took her first touch of the ball, even if the majority of fans tried to drown that out with further cheers!",
      "\"I'm probably expecting a little booing,\" she said. \"I hope it's a little bit, but it might be a lot.",
      "\"A few of the fans have come out to support me at PSG, but United is their No.1 team. I understand that.\"",
      "When asked about the prospect of Earps being booed, United head coach Marc Skinner also moved to ward off potential ill-will towards his former player. \"Deep down I know Mary is a good person,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm sure part of bringing out a book is bringing out controversial stuff that will help sell the book. I know that she has to defend that publicly.",
      "\"Knowing the human she is, I'm sure she will be getting criticism that she won't like. It's part of the other side of releasing a book.",
      "\"But she's a great person, she doesn't need me to say that really.",
      "\"I hope people toe the line with criticism, but I'm sure Mary understands the situation she's put herself in.",
      "\"She's on a platform where people are interested in what she says, so that's a credit to her and to her hard work. The goalkeeper we had at the start, to the one that left, was not the same person. She transformed.\"",
      "Once the whistle goes this evening, Earps will be hoping her performance will not leave the home fans so happy. United headed into the match with two wins from two matches in the Champions League - while PSG had yet to pick up a point in the competition this season.",

      "Manchester United Women have continued their 100 per cent record after a 2-1 victory over PSG at Old Trafford.",
      "Melvine Malard opened the scoring for United as she shrugged off a defender to curl the ball beyond Mary Earps. The Reds would have deserved to go into the break ahead however Olga Carmona had other ideas.",
      "Picking up the ball 25 yards out she fired right into the top corner to make it 1-1 at the break. But it was United who picked up the victory that they deserved when an excellent team move was finished by Fridolina Rolfo with a great header.",

      "United would have been deservedly ahead at the break. Malard's curling effort gave Earps no chance. However, Carmona has just produced a goal of the season contender to make it 1-1 at half time",
      "PSG level. Carmona with a beauty. She picks the ball up 25 yards out and curls it into the top corner. In fairness to PSG, that was special.",

      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is nestled between high-rise flats when you leave the overground White Hart Lane station.",
      "The glass facade and sleek design immediately catch the eye. It looks almost as if a spaceship from a faraway galaxy has docked in north London and you can't approach quickly enough.",
      "Manchester United visited Tottenham last weekend and I made my first visit to their stadium. I'd been repeatedly told it was the best arena in the country and it didn't fall short of that billing.",
      "Although the security staff took their time to admit the press into the media suite, it was worth the wait, as the press facilities and food offerings are second to none in the Premier League.",
      "The press food at Stamford Bridge is excellent, but Tottenham edges their London neighbours. The 12.30pm kick-off meant a full breakfast was on offer and the selection was superb for a media suite.",
      "The press room itself was akin to a luxury hotel reception. There was ample working space, comfortable leather-padded seats and Spurs offer lockers for journalists to store bags.",
      "The walk from the media suite to the press box is sign-posted - you could easily get lost on the way - and the interior of the ground is even more impressive than the exterior.",
      "Tottenham left White Hart Lane in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, and moved to their new 61,000-seater venue three years later. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new 100,000-seater Old Trafford by 2030 and there are a few lessons to be learned from Tottenham.",
      "The design of the stadium is outstanding. You feel like you're working in a special arena throughout your visit, and architecture firm Populous deserved all the plaudits they received.",
      "From a journalist's perspective, the press box is spacious and well-positioned, offering a good vantage point, while the media auditorium is a superb space for managers to conduct their post-match duties.",
      "Ratcliffe wants the new Old Trafford, set to be designed by Foster + Partners, to be the greatest arena in the world, and they will deliver if the rebuild is anything like Tottenham's home.",
      "Tottenham's stadium was rebuilt 170 yards away from where White Hart Lane stood, which means the feeling of the old ground hasn't been totally lost, and the new Old Trafford will seek to retain that 'feeling'.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is designed to maximise supporter experience and it brings fans closer to the pitch than at any comparable-sized stadium in the United Kingdom.",
      "The distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres to 7.9 metres, and the single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK with a capacity of 17,500 people.",
      "The steep South Stand is remarkable. It was designed with the hope that it would generate an intimidating atmosphere, but no such noise was produced during the game on Saturday.",
      "Like a lot of big clubs in the Premier League, Spurs have become a tourist attraction, which means there were hundreds of fans with tickets in that stand who did not contribute to the atmosphere.",
      "That is their prerogative and 'tourist fans' are still valued fans, but local Tottenham season ticket holders have argued their South Stand should be a designated area for supporters looking to create noise.",
      "The Stretford End is currently that stand within Old Trafford, and United should consider introducing a designated singing section to ensure an atmosphere can be created in the new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "I was fortunate enough to visit White Hart Lane before it was demolished. It was an ageing ground and Spurs were right to move on, but it could be intimidating for the opposition.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur stadium is not intimidating. It feels welcoming. United need to ensure they don't fall into the same trap.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Fabrizio Romano has named Manchester United’s ‘dream’ midfield signing and both he and sources at TEAMtalk have confirmed the player wants to join the Red Devils.",
      "It’s no secret Man Utd are on the hunt for impactful additions in central midfield next year. However, what’s less clear is which of the countless players they’re linked with they actually want to sign, and of those, who is number one on the shortlist.",
      "From just the Premier League, Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson are understood to be in Man Utd’s crosshairs. From further afield, the likes of Conor Gallagher and Angelo Stiller have been mentioned.",
      "United may yet make multiple additions in midfield, but obviously will not sign five new players in the same position. And per the latest from transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano, we now know who United will give priority to signing before all others.",
      "“There is a lot of confusion in the media [about] who is the dream target for Manchester United in midfield,” began Romano when speaking on his YouTube channel.",
      "“My information remains that there are several names, but I keep telling you since August, don’t forget Man Utd want Carlos Baleba.",
      "“Baleba wants to go to Man Utd. Man Utd want Baleba. The conversations with the player and his agents were very good but at that time in August, Brighton didn’t want to sell the player.”",
      "United made an official approach to Brighton for Baleba in the summer window, but were informed a deal could not be made at that time, irrespective of how much United bid.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest in the 21-year-old has maintained and Romano then stressed a winter window move will be “difficult,” with a summer swoop in 2026 the likelier scenario.",
      "“In January it’s likely to be a difficult deal,” the reporter continued. “Brighton insist on not selling the player [in January].",
      "“But for the summer, unless the stance changes in January, let’s see what happens… but the summer of 2026, for sure, Man Utd see Baleba as a priority target.”",
      "Romano concluded by stating Man Utd will “insist” on signing Baleba next year and and the player is “very keen” on making the move.",
      "At the time of United’s approach for Baleba in August, it was widely reported the Cameroon international was receptive to the interest but was not actively seeking to leave Brighton.",
      "However, Romano categorically stated Baleba now “wants to go to Man Utd” and that echoes what our own insider, Dean Jones, reported on Sunday.",
      "Jones revealed Baleba “clearly wants the move” and United’s summer approach – which may have been launched with one eye on turning the player’s head ahead of a move in 2026 – appears to have succeeded.",
      "The player is now unsettled on the south coast and would jump at the chance to move to Old Trafford. However, Brighton – who previously valued Baleba in excess of £100m – won’t go down quietly.",
      "Baleba is contracted to the Seagulls until 2028 and there’s an option for an extra season. As such, Man Utd’s biggest issue now is negotiating a more palatable fee with Brighton, but one that is still convincing enough to get their green light.",
      "Jones exclusively told TEAMtalk on Sunday: “It is being talked about again that Baleba is a priority target, but it has to be stressed that they [United] are not paying £100million for him any time soon.",
      "“The player clearly wants the move, and their attempt to turn his head in the summer has worked, but his form has actually been worse since then, and so I do not see United going close to the level Brighton value him at.",
      "“The message remains clear that United want a midfielder in January and also a midfielder in summer.",
      "“So they are working on targets that are attainable in each of those, and the ones from the Premier League seem unattainable in January. That’s how the picture is for now.",
      "“Obviously, these things can change, but Baleba is going to have to be very patient here because a lot is going on.",
      "“United do still like him; they do still think he would suit the role, but his form and valuation do not match up at the moment. And on top of that, Brighton don’t want to sell him in January.”",
      "In other news, insider Ben Jacobs has revealed it’s “absolutely true” that Manchester United want to sign a Newcastle star who director of football Jason Wilcox knows “incredibly well.”",
      "Elsewhere, Eric Cantona has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has “destroyed” the style of football created by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, and the legend has revealed his offer to help the club was rebuffed.",
      "Finally, Manchester United scouts will be patting themselves on their backs for identifying a young midfield gem who has won a major award, but the Red Devils will not find it easy to negotiate a deal with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis."

      "Man Utd still want to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba as transfer expert Fabrizio Romano clears up rumours about their “dream target”.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new players in the summer transfer market with INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe targeting improvements in attack as a priority.",
      "Despite making some enquiries about midfielders, Man Utd ended the summer transfer window without a signing in that area, which was seen as a major oversight by many fans and former players.",
      "Since then, there has been speculation about lots of different midfielders joining Man Utd in January with Conor Gallagher, Angelo Stiller, Baleba, Adam Wharton, Andrey Santos and Elliot Anderson some of the names linked.",
      "And now transfer expert Romano insists there are still a lot of names on the Man Utd shortlist for the winter window but that Baleba appears to be at the top of their list.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “I want to close this video with midfielders, guys, as many of you keep asking me. There is a lot of confusion in the media: who is the dream target for Manchester United in midfield?",
      "READ: Man Utd still the club with most England caps, with Spurs ahead of Arsenal",
      "“My information, guys, remains that there are several names, and we will discuss all of them in the videos these days. But I keep telling you that Man Utd want Carlos Baleba and Baleba wants to go to Man Utd.",
      "“The conversation with the player and his agency is very good. In August, Brighton didn’t want to sell the player. In January, it is likely to be a difficult deal again because Brighton insist on not selling the player. But for the summer, let’s say for 2026, Man Utd see Baleba as a priority target.",
      "“I gave you a video last summer saying Baleba will remain a target if the deal doesn’t happen now. Man Utd want to insist on the deal in 2026, and that remains the case. Man Utd still want Baleba and Baleba is still very keen on a move to Man Utd.",
      "“So, Baleba is a name we have to keep very high on Man Utd’s shortlist for the midfield.”",
      "Spanish website Defensa Central has claimed that current Man Utd midfielder Casemiro has been offered a new contract at Old Trafford with the Red Devils looking to more than cut his salary in half.",
      "The report adds: ‘United’s priority is to renew Casemiro’s contract for another year. His current contract expires in 2027, he earns £350,000 a week, and the Old Trafford club wants him to stay but on a much lower salary: £130,000 a week . This figure is ridiculous, and Casemiro will likely reject it. If that happens, [Aurelien] Tchouameni is the Red Devils’ first choice.’",
      "Chelsea are not trying to sign Rodrygo or Vinicius Junior from Real Madrid in the January transfer window, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘torn over’ signing a new striker in January after Benjamin Sesko picked up an injury before the international break.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘decided’ who is at the ‘top of the list’ as they look to sign a new midfielder in 2026.",
      "Manchester United star Matheus Cunha answered with just three words when asked by an Arsenal fan if he was going to join the north London club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing’ to offer Casemiro a new contract, but they want him to take a massive pay-cut.",
      "Man Utd are desperate to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window with six targets identified ahead of the winter, according to reports."

The goalkeeper’s most recent appearance for the Three Lions had come during his time at West Brom, but when he replaced Joe Hart at half-time of a 1-0 win over Sweden, he was plying his trade in Turkey with Bursaspor.

He had played three times for England before moving to Spain in 1980, with his subsequent three caps all falling in that calendar year. He later moved to Sporting Gijon, Marseille, Charleroi and Rayo Vallecano (twice) before his untimely passing in 1989, but never again came onto the Three Lions radar.",

He earned more caps in three years at Rangers (22) than in four with Tottenham (20), as well as 12 at Lazio and three with Middlesbrough.

His time in Serie A was not quite so memorable, with Sven-Goran Eriksson playing him out of position at right-back in his only year outside of England, but he did keep his international place.",

      "Man Utd flop Antony is now being likened to Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar just months after Ruben Amorim sold him to Real Betis for £22m.",
      "The Red Devils signed Antony from Ajax in a deal worth around £85m, making him the most expensive Eredivisie player in history, with Erik ten Hag making him one of his first signings at the club.",
      "It never worked out for the Brazilian at Old Trafford as he only managed five goals and three assists in 62 Premier League appearances over three seasons.",
      "Antony was sent on loan to Real Betis in the second half of last season under Amorim before the Portuguese head coach and the Man Utd hierarchy took the decision to sell him to the Spanish outfit at a great loss.",
      "After an impressive loan spell last term, Antony has once again been impressing in La Liga with six goals and two assists in 11 matches in all competitions.",
      "Real Betis defender Marc Bartra insists that fans are now “seeing the real Antony again” after a horrible time at Man Utd, and has likened him to Ronaldo and Neymar.",
      "READ: Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal stars in danger of missing out on expanded 48-team World Cup",
      "Portugal great Ronaldo is regarded as one of the best players that has ever lived, while Neymar is seen as the most talented player of his generation in Brazil.",
      "And when asked how Antony has been able to revive his career at Betis, Bartra told Mundobetis: “It’s a style of football that suits him very well, that’s why we’re seeing the real Antony again, even an improved Antony.",
      "“The first day I spoke with him, I already saw his mentality, with that quality and that Brazilian talent.",
      "“I always say he’s a mix between Neymar and Cristiano. He has the same mentality as Cristiano, always striving for more and being very focused on the game.”",
      "Antony was forced to train away from the rest of the first team over the summer as Amorim made him one of the ‘bomb squad’ as Man Utd looked to find the Brazilian a new club.",
      "On his time at Man Utd, Antony said: “They were very tough months in England, more than 40 days in a hotel, training separately… I feel like I was disrespected, but that’s not the point.",
      "“I don’t want to create controversy, that’s life. I’m feel grateful towards the club. There were bad times, but also good times with two titles.",
      "“My family travelled to Seville four or five days before the deal was finalised; they had rented the house. I had already spoken to them and my heart was telling me to return to Betis.",
      "“I always look at happiness first and I was very happy here at Betis. I know my children and my wife are happy here.",
      "“Before making the decision, I spoke with them all. It’s an incredible city and the people, too. Not just the fans, but everyone.",
      "“I looked at my happiness first, because I know that when I’m happy, things turn out well. Money is important, but happiness is much more important.”",
      "According to reports, Portugal are ‘preparing’ to issue a ‘complaint’ to FIFA over Cristiano Ronaldo’s red card against the Republic of Ireland.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo was brutally mocked by the Republic of Ireland supporters after being sent off as Portugal lost 2-0 on Thursday night.",

      "It is still arguably too soon to judge Sesko as he is still settling in at Man Utd and certainly has the necessary physical attributes to become a great striker in the coming years.",
      "Despite this, Shearer has explained why he is not sold on Sesko.",
      "“One player that must do better for United is Benjamin Sesko,” Shearer told Betfair.",

      "“They’re far from the finished article,” Shearer added.",
      "“I still think there’s a lot of work to be done, and I don’t expect them to finish in the top six. Just outside that would still be an improvement given last season.",

      "Frank was one of the longest-serving managers in England at Brentford, but he left the London club in the summer to join Spurs.",
      "A move to a Big Six club was overdue for the Danish head coach, who had done a great job at Brentford over many years as they surpassed expectations to stabilise in the Premier League.",

      "‘In the morning, he sat in club owner Jim Ratcliffe’s garage in London – an unlikely place for a meeting with Manchester United, but such is the world of football. Hours later he entered the plush luxury of the Mayfair Hotel near Hyde Park, where Chelsea wanted to hear for the second time how the Dane viewed the game, people and leadership.’",
      "‘Two meetings. Two of the world’s biggest clubs. On one and the same day. No contract was signed. United went with Rúben Amorim. Chelsea with Enzo Maresca. But for Thomas Frank, the day was proof that his name had now become one that was talked about in the finest circles.’",

      "Initial contact from a pair of London clubs has reportedly been made with Dwaine Maynard, the agent and brother of Marcus Rashford, about his Premier League return.",
      "Rashford is on his second loan away from Manchester United in as many seasons. While he’s one of their main goal threats, the Red Devils man has never counted boss Ruben Amorim as a fan.",
      "That much was evident almost as soon as the Portuguese manager walked through the door in November 2024, and as such Rashford went out on loan to Aston Villa, and now with Barcelona.",
      "Reports have long suggested Rashford wanted to play for the Spanish giants, and there’s a chance he does so permanently, with a €30million (£26.2m) option to buy looking a steal given the forward has six goals and nine assists already at Barca.",
      "However, El Nacional reports the United man’s future in Spain is ‘far from guaranteed.’ There are reportedly doubts at the cliub over whether paying the option for Rashford is worth it.",
      "It’s felt Barca could use the money they could spend on the Englishman on a star striker instead.",
      "If they aren’t to sign Rashford, he will still have options. He’s already said to be exploring them in the event that he’s not signed permanently at Barca – though that is his preference.",
      "Indeed, it’s said he doesn’t want to waste time and is ready to join another club if Barca decide they don’t want him.",
      "His brother and agent, Maynard, has reportedly already held meetings in regards to his future, with London clubs Chelsea and Tottenham.",
      "Both are said to have made initial contact to try to convince Rashford to move.",
      "Tottenham’s struggles to find a fitting left-winger this season mean the Englishman would be a perfect asset there, while the Blues have a number of forward options, so that move might not be welcomed.",
      "In any case, it’s known that Rashford does not want to return to United, and his preference, if they want to sign him, is to remain with Barca.",
      "Given he’s got more assists than any other La Liga player this term suggests Barca would be happy with signing him, as he’s been in top form and is having a big impact on the second-placed club.",
      "Barca’s uncertainty in regards to the move does not seem the most rational, and given he’s set to be cheaper than other players who’d impact them in the same way, it could be a poor call to let him go and try to sign someone better for a similar price.",
      "Even before kick-off this looked like a game that England players looking to stake their World Cup claim would rather not be playing in, and so it proved for Eberechi ...",
      "Roy Keane thinks Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford should be starting for England ahead of Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Solskjaer says a poorly ear was to blame for Sancho’s struggles under him at Man Utd but can’t put his finger on why Rashford “didn’t enjoy himself” at Old Trafford.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford is reportedly at risk of missing out on a permanent move to FC Barcelona due to a ‘major stumbling block’.",
      "Rashford has been impressing on the pitch for Barcelona but one of his teammates believes there’s more to come on the basis of his “magic” in training."

      "Man Utd have been told by a former club scout that they “gave up” on Real Madrid star Alvaro Carreras too soon with the Patrick Dorgu signing “a dud”.",
      "After an inconsistent start to the season, Man Utd are now five Premier League matches unbeaten after winning three and drawing two under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Dorgu – who was signed last January from Serie A side Lecce in a deal that could reach €35m – have not impressed with Paul Parker recently speaking out over Dalot’s performances in particular.",
      "Former Man Utd youngster Carreras moved onto Real Madrid in the summer after leaving the Red Devils in 2024 to sign for Portuguese side Benfica.",
      "And Man Utd have been criticised by their former Polish scout Piotr Sadowski, who also left Old Trafford in 2024, for allowing Carreras to move.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Liverpool drop a full 15 places!",
      "Sadowski told Przeglad Sportowy of Carreras: “Initially, his career path was quite good. He was loaned to Preston, received good reviews, and…United gave up on him, selling him to Benfica for a small fee.",
      "“Carreras is a truly top-class player. There’s a good chance he’ll become the best, or one of the best, left-backs in the world. He scored a beautiful goal recently against Valencia in La Liga. It was a huge mistake for United to let him go.",
      "“So something is missing here and I think that something is United’s lack of courage in investing in young players.”",
      "On Dorgu, Sadowski added: “A dud, I definitely agree. And he was brought in for €30 million. Honestly, having recently worked at Blackburn Rovers and operating on a much lower transfer budget, I would have had no problem finding a few players at Dortmund’s level for Manchester United, but not for €30 million, only up to a maximum of four.",
      "“Manchester United have been in crisis for several years now, desperate to return to the top, so they’re wary of bringing in youngsters. Coach Ruben Amorim was supposed to be the one to do this, but the results haven’t been right, so he prefers to buy ready-made players.",
      "“Whether he has anyone to choose from in the backroom is another matter. In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell [he plays for Sheffield Wednesday]. The club’s biggest shortfall right now is the transfer players.”",
      "Former Manchester United scout Piotr Sadowski has taken the club to task after the “abandoned” academy star Alvaro Carreras who could now become “the best” left-back in the world.",
      "Dorgu absolutely isn’t ‘a dud’ and Man Utd leaning on the scouting opinions of a man who thinks he is for seven years explains a lot about pre-Amorim transfers.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been tipped to replace two players in January, while Matheus Cunha’s impact on the team has been “exaggerated”.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "Man Utd defender Patrick Dorgu has revealed he was “shocked” to see Rasmus Hojlund leave Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "Real Madrid have ‘generated great anger’ at Man Utd following one of their purchases in the summer transfer market, according to reports."

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",

      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",

      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",

      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",

      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",

      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",

      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",

      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
      "Freddie Woodman",
      "Woodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.",
      "In the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.",
      "Rhys Williams",
      "Even with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Casemiro is in the final year of his Manchester United contract, 33 years old and it's fair to admit he's also past his pomp, but he is a crucial cog in Ruben Amorim's midfield.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, five have come when Casemiro was on the pitch. The other 15 goals they've shipped have come without him. That pattern was clear in United's 2-2 draw at Spurs.",
      "Casemiro was taken off with less than 20 minutes to go and United leading through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header. Spurs then scored twice late on when he left the field.",
      "Casemiro has an undeniable impact on United but Amorim's over-reliance on the Brazil international is a further reflection of the club's need to find an appropriate heir in midfield. United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",
      "However, Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser extended Spurs' winless home run in the competition to five.",
      "In spite of these struggles, and a raft of injuries with 10 players out, Spurs are still third in the table. Sorting those home struggles is crucial if Spurs are to be contenders.Zinny Boswell",
      "Good things can't last forever, and in the case of Arsenal, their run of clean sheets came to its conclusion at the Stadium of Light.",
      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",
      "Had another clean sheet been secured, this wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. But, ultimately, this would be costly.",
      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",
      "Admittedly, in the second half, the Black Cats were at the mercy of Arsenal, who looked likely to score with almost every attack. In the first, though, it was a very different tale.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side put in a commanding first 45 minutes. And it wasn't by playing the most beautiful football. It was by forcing their opponents to play the game exactly how they wanted it to be played.",
      "The resolute nature of Sunderland's rearguard performance began to irritate the Gunners, and by the time they conceded they were just playing into the hands of the hosts. Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",
      "When people say there are no easy games in the Premier League, Sunderland are the evidence they will continue to point towards.Callum Bishop",
      "Booed off at half-time, given a standing ovation at the final whistle. There was a big mood-shift at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea eventually broken down and then tore apart Wolves.",
      "The Chelsea supporters had been celebrating before kick-off, too, watching Arsenal get pegged back by Sunderland on the TV screens inside the stadium. Those two results, leave Chelsea second in the Premier League title race and just six points off the Gunners.",
      "Are the world champions now Premier League contenders?",
      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",
      "After this third international break of the season, the hard and decisive winter months begin. Chelsea are well placed - just as they were at this stage last season. Can they kick on and go for the crown?Peter Smith",
      "Former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil says the club needs a \"reset\". To stay in the Premier League they'll need a miracle.",
      "Every single top-flight side with two or fewer points at this stage have then been relegated - Man City in 1995-96 (2), Sunderland in 2016-17 (2), Sheffield United in 2020-21 (1) and 2023-24 (1), and Norwich in 2021-22 (2).",
      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",
      "Even in 20 years time, Tomas Soucek will be scoring goals for West Ham in the Premier League. Probably.",
      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",

      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "Ruben Amorim was downbeat after Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Man Utd at Spurs and extended their unbeaten run in the league to five games, their longest under him, after throwing away another lead and seeing Benjamin Sesko forced off with a knee injury",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his team \"have a lot of problems\" as he delivered a reality check after the 2-2 draw at Tottenham.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a point for United to extend their unbeaten league run to five games, their longest under the Portuguese, but Amorim was frustrated to see his side repeat the mistakes of last Saturday's draw at Nottingham Forest.",
      "United led for nearly an hour through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header, but late goals from Spurs substitute Mathys Tel and Richarlison, seven minutes apart, turned the game before De Ligt rescued a draw with his side a player down after Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "Amorim said United, who would have gone second had they held on to win, struggled to cope when he took Casemiro and Harry Maguire off with less than 20 minutes to go as he struck a downbeat tone ahead of the international break.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
