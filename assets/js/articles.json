      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of Benjamin Sesko despite Newcastle also wanting to land the RB Leipzig frontman. Both teams are in the market for a striker, but the Red Devils look to have won the race.",
      "The Slovenian is poised to sign a five-year deal at Old Trafford and compliment the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo with his possible signing taking the Manchester outfit's spending to around the £200million mark.",
      "Ruben Amorim knew he needed to get serious quality through the door if he was to improve on last year's horror showing, which ended with United finishing 15th. The club still need to try and get a number of players off their books or risk carrying them for several months.",
      "Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are all looking for ways out of Manchester and their exits could help fund some of the club's future business. Here's the latest news involving the Premier League outfit.",
      "Leipzig have confirmed Sesko is training away from his team-mates as speculation over his move to Manchester ramps up. The striker reportedly told his team-mates earlier this summer that he would be on the move to pastures new.",
      "The German club confirmed on Wednesday morning that the 22-year-old was again working individually. In a brief statement they said: \"Wednesday squad update: Andrija Maksimovic is back in Leipzig, but is training individually today. Benjamin Sesko and Lukas Klostermann are also working individually.\"",
      "Sesko is also very much on Newcastle's radar and the Magpies were the club to make the first bid. However the striker has expressed a desire to head to Old Trafford, shunning Champions League football in the process, as Amorim closes on the No 9 he's been after.",
      "Those in Manchester have made contact with Brighton as they look to land explore a deal for midfielder Carlos Baleba. The Cameroon star enjoyed a stellar year last season and the Seagulls have no plans to cash in.",
      "The Red Devils are aware the move may be unrealistic, especially if their transfer funds to end up being spent on Sesko, but are looking to gauge whether anything can be done in the coming weeks as Ruben Amorim seeks to further bolster his squad, reports the Athletic.",
      "United's current focus is on landing the Slovenian from RB Leipzig after they jumped ahead of Newcastle in the transfer race. There is an acceptance that any move, which could cost more than £70million, will make any swoop for the Brighton star very difficult.",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta is confident the club will be able to register Marcus Rashford and their other signings before the new season starts. The forward has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "The deal includes a £26m option to buy and involves Barcelona paying his wages in full. There were concerns that Barcelona may not be able to register Rashford due to their financial struggles - but they have been addressed. \"It's progressing well,\" Laporta told ESPN. \"We're doing our job and we're confident that we'll be able to register everyone.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko is heading to Manchester United after snubbing Newcastle United, a decision that sees the Slovenian forgo an opportunity to play in this season's Champions League.",
      "And while that should be seen as a coup for Old Trafford decision-makers, evidence that despite their decade of decline they remain a bigger draw than a side that finished in the top five last season, it is a huge blow for the Toon who still fear the sale of Alexander Isak to Liverpool.",
      "But there are also knock-on effects for the dressing room Sesko is heading towards in the north west with his impending arrival set to alter the roles of team-mates - and leave the future of at least one star in serious jeopardy.",
      "Here is how United’s latest arrival could impact Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee plus new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After two frustrating seasons in which he has struggled to score consistently with the confidence draining slowly from him, speculation for much of the summer to date has surrounded the Denmark striker being sold.",
      "Sesko’s arrival will increase the likelihood of that happening significantly with United willing to accept a fee in the range of half the £72m they paid Atalanta for Hojliund in the summer of 2023. A number of Serie A sides have been linked but no interest has translated into a formal offer yet.",
      "Hojlund himself is determined to transform his fortunes and was unfazed about transfer speculation with the likes of Sesko: \"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.\"",
      "Injury problems may have hindered an average debut season at the club but he does have the size and skillset that could provide Ruben Amorim with scope to mix things up.",
      "Expect him to be an impact sub behind Sesko, which may see the pressure be taken off the big Dutchman and United fans will hope that can allow him to play with a bit more freedom when given the opportunity.",
      "The Brazil star thrived cutting in from the wing while at Wolves and Sesko being the central member of the front three will surely bring the best out of Cunha. He linked up impressively with Jorgen Strand Larsen as the middleman at Molineux and Amorim will expect similar with Sesko.",
      "United’s other big summer arrival is in a similar boat to Cunha.",
      "At Brentford last season he spent a lot of time operating more centrally but arguably his best work in West London came when providing more width, stretching opposition defences and simultaneously hurting them himself by switching inside or ensuring more space for his team-mates to thrive.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Benjamin Sesko could come at a cost, and not just a literal one. By prioritising the Slovenian striker, Ruben Amorim's side are unlikely to be able to plug their midfield hole with Carlos Baleba.",
      "United are set to pay up to £74million including add-ons for Sesko, with RB Leipzig confirming the player is training away from the rest of their squad. The Red Devils are confident they have beaten Newcastle to his signing, with the deal set to take their summer spending to around £200m in total.",
      "They have also explored a move for Brighton star Baleba, whou wouldn't come cheap. According to The Athletic, the move is likely unrealistic given United's spending power, but they are still testing the water in an effort to get an idea of whether a move might be possible.",
      "Signing both Sesko and Baleba in this window would require significant sales elsewhere, something which doesn't appear to be on the cards. There is likely to be some money coming in, with Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all potentially leaving before the window shuts, but that would counterbalanced by the outlay for Sesko.",
      "United have already spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo while also bringing in young left-back Diego Leon. A move for Baleba is likely to have to wait until 2026, despite Amorim having limited options in front of the defence.",
      "Baleba joined Brighton from Lille in the summer of 2023, just a fortnight after the Seagulls sold fellow midfielder Moises Caicedo to Chelsea. The Cameroon international made 34 league appearances last term, scoring his first goals for the club, and was asked about his future in May.",
      "\"If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future,\" he said. \"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\"",
      "United's season begins against Arsenal on August 17, and Ruben Amorim's side have impressed in pre-season. They claimed two wins and a draw in their three Premier League Summer Series fixtures, and head coach Amorim has seen plenty of positives.",
      "\"I think it's a perfect feeling to go back to Carrington,\" Amorim said ahead of Saturday's friendly against Fiorentina. \"The momentum of the tour was perfect.",
      "\"We had two weeks to work in a good environment with a good feeling to go back to Carrington. We are near to the start of the season and we are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things.\"",

      "Mikel Arteta insists Viktor Gyokeres will be \"100 per cent\" mentally ready to kickstart Arsenal's Premier League campaign with a bang against Manchester United. The Swede worked tirelessly on his first Emirates outing on Wednesday night but was starved of service as the Gunners were beaten 3-2 at home by Villarreal in their penultimate pre-season fixture. Gyokeres was subbed on 63 minutes but Arteta has no doubts he'll be in a position to hit the ground running this season, starting at Old Trafford.",
      "Arteta said of his marquee £63.7million summer capture: \"I think mentally and understanding what he needs to do, he will be 100 per cent or more because he's so willing. He's so confident as well that he can deliver for us straight away, I have no doubt he'll be in a really good place.\"",
      "Gyokeres has endured a gruelling, whirlwind summer, but Arteta is adamant he noticed immediate chemistry with his new Arsenal team-mates on the pitch.",
      "When asked how long it may take to click for the 27-year-old striker, the Spaniard added: \"I hope just days, every day in training I think he's getting a really good feeling.",
      "\"I think he's built connections as well outside of the pitch, which I think is really important with players that are going to help him to be in the position that he needs to get in.",
      "\"He hasn't trained really with the team for two months, so he's done five or six sessions now before today. I think he will take another step in the right direction on Saturday and he will be in a better condition.\"",
      "Teenage sensation Max Dowman dazzled from the bench but Arteta revealed the 15-year-old starlet is now heading on holiday for a well-earned break. The Arsenal boss was unable to provide any assurances that Dowman will be making his top-flight debut imminently ahead of the new season.",
      "He said of the nimble attacker: \"Let's see how it goes. Let's go into Saturday, into his break as well. He needs a little break because he hasn't had any holidays really. So, in the next few days, he's going to have a break, which I think he needs. Then the following week, he'll be ready again to go.\"",
      "Arsenal play Athletic Club on Saturday in their final pre-season fixture before they gear up for the trip to Manchester United. Arteta has no doubt his side are the finished article - they now just have to prove it after three second-place finishes.",
      "He continued: \"We know we need to make the next step and we're going to be better. The same as any other team, when you look at the competition, the pieces on the puzzle that they're adding, some of the ones are big ones as well. So, we're all trying to be at our best and ready to compete to win the Premier League.\"",

      "Manchester United icon Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta even wanted new striker signing Viktor Gyökeres. Scholes also fears that the Swede may not adapt well to the Gunners' high levels of possession.",
      "After struggling without a bona fide No. 9 for some time, Arsenal finally completed a deal for Sporting CP star Gyökeres last month, snapping him up after a summer of speculation for roughly £64million.",
      "The Gunners fought off competition from Premier League rivals United for the 27-year-old, but Red Devils legend Scholes has now questioned whether head coach Arteta wanted the player, and whether Gyökeres will prosper in light of Arsenal's high-possession playstyle.",
      "\"[Arsenal needed a] Centre forward, I just wonder if you've chosen the right one,\" Scholes declared on The Overlap Fan Debate. \"Because there was a lot of um-ing and ah-ing about it, I wondered if Mikel Arteta really wanted him, as the main one he wants? I'm not too sure, and he's got him now.",
      "\"He's had a really strange career path - Brighton, Coventry, and then he's gone to Sporting Lisbon and his goal record is absolutely brilliant – you can't take it away from him.\"",
      "Gyökeres netted a staggering 97 times in 102 matches for Sporting in all competitions over the past two seasons, but Scholes doubts whether the Gunners' style of play suits him.",
      "\"If there's any team that he could go to and create chances, then it should be Arsenal and it should be a really good match,\" continued Scholes.",
      "\"The only thing I'd say against Gyökeres really is that with Sporting Lisbon, he's probably playing on the counter-attack a lot, in Europe especially.",
      "\"You think of Arsenal, they have the ball an awful lot, is he going to be clever enough to make these runs in behind? A lot of him that you see, he's sprinting from the halfway line almost.",
      "\"You can't keep up with him, he's ramming people, he's quick and he's smashing the ball in. Is he going to be that clever striker – we know Isak can do that. Can Gyökeres do that?\"",
      "One player who thinks that Gyökeres will fare well at the Emirates is club captain Martin Odegaard, who sang his new team-mate's praises during Arsenal's pre-season visit to Hong Kong.",
      "\"I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far,\" claimed Odegaard. \"Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves. He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher and intelligent as well.",
      "\"I think he's a very complete striker and you can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. I'm really excited to have him with the team. He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality, the energy, and the willingness. I'm excited to have a pitch with him.\"",

      "Incoming Manchester United recruit Benjamin Sesko is the top scorer under the age of 23 in Europe's five biggest leagues over the past two seasons. Ruben Amorim appears to be getting a new No. 9 in the form of RB Leipzig star Sesko, who is the subject of a £65.3million bid from the Red Devils, which could rise to nearly £74m if certain add-ons are achieved.",
      "Premier League rivals Newcastle have also shown interest in the striker and have put forward a more lucrative proposal than United's, but the 22-year-old's preference is a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko is currently training separately from his Leipzig colleagues, according to a statement released by his club, and while some have expressed doubts about his abilities and hefty price tag, his goal-scoring statistics speak for themselves.",
      "This puts him one goal ahead of Real Madrid and England sensation Jude Bellingham, and five goals ahead of Florian Wirtz, whose summer transfer to Liverpool could set a British record if certain add-ons are met.",
      "In fourth place on the list is Bayern Munich phenom Jamal Musiala, who has racked up 33 goals during this period, followed by PSG's Bradley Barcola and German ace Maximilian Beier on 26.",
      "Sesko's impressive goal-scoring record, outperforming some of Europe's top young talents, will be a welcome sound to Amorim's ears. It suggests that the 22-year-old won't be overwhelmed when he arrives in Manchester, and United are fully committed to Sesko, having already agreed personal terms with him.",
      "Current Red Devil Rasmus Hojlund, who also scored 26 goals during this period, underscores the gap between him and Sesko. Despite not being entirely goal-shy since his £72m move to Old Trafford in 2023, the Dane has struggled to meet high expectations.",
      "Now, it seems likely that Sesko will join United, and Hojlund is reportedly prepared for the possibility of being pushed out if the Slovenian signs. Just two seasons after his £72m transfer, Hojlund could be available for as little as £30m, less than half of what was originally paid for him.",
      "However, during United's pre-season tour of the US, Hojlund expressed optimism about his future, stating: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "\"I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "The Magpies have endured a difficult window with a number of their targets choosing to look elsewhere. But Eddie Howe is looking to land the defender from the Italian club having already seen a bid for Thiaw rejected by the Rossoneri.",
      "Reports in Germany claim that a fresh offer is likely to come from Newcastle. The German international's versatility has proved a huge plus with Thiaw playing centrally, as a right-back and a defensive midfielder in the past.",
      "Negotiations continue between the Premier League side and their Serie A rivals, whom they played in the Champions League two years ago. Schalke, who Thiaw played for before his move to Milan, also stand to benefit from any possible deal due to their sell-on clause.",
      "So far this summer Newcastle's only major signing has been their £55million capture of Anthony Elanga, who joined after an impressive year at Nottingham Forest. He will bolster their frontline but other than him Howe has struggled to get new faces through the door.",
      "Their latest blow could come with Sesko potentially heading to Manchester. The Red Devils are increasingly confident of signing the Slovenian from RB Leipzig after the striker indicated his preference to join the club with both options available to him.",
      "Newcastle are interested in Sesko and made the first move with their initial bid, but the young striker favours a move to Old Trafford, where he is due to sign a five-year deal. The Magpies can offer Champions League football, but that doesn't seem to have been enough to tempt him.",
      "The problem for Newcastle is they want to get a top class striker through the door before they allow Alexander Isak to leave the club. The Swede is pushing for the exit door with Liverpool eyeing up a move that could cost them as much as £150m if the Magpies valuation is met.",
      "Isak has been told to train away from the first-team having also missed their pre-season trip to Asia. He would leave a huge void in the Newcastle attack with Howe also seeing the likes of Joao Pedro, who was on his shortlist, opt for Chelsea ahead of a move to St James' Park.",

      "Newcastle are expected to move on to other targets with Manchester United now the red-hot favourites to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig after submitting an offer for the sought-after striker.",
      "The Magpies already had plans to acquire new No 9 this summer before transfer speculation linking Alexander Isak with Liverpool heated up. But unfortunately for Newcastle, they have suffered a number of setbacks in the market this summer.",
      "They were keen on signing Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt and bid for the Frenchman, only to then see him move to Anfield.",
      "Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and Bryan Mbeumo are among the other attackers who have headed elsewhere after being courted by Newcastle this summer.",
      "And the Magpies are now braced for more disappointment in their pursuit of Sesko, who is understood to favour a move to Manchester United.",
      "With that in mind, talkSPORT claim that Ollie Watkins, Nicolas Jackson, Yoane Wissa and Lois Openda are alternative targets that Newcastle are now considering.",
      "Aston Villa's Watkins has previously been linked with both Arsenal and United, while interest in Wissa had emerged previously. The DR Congo forward has also been linked to Tottenham.",
      "Jackson could yet leave Chelsea this summer and has also been linked with United. Openda, meanwhile, scored nine goals in the Bundesliga for RB Leipzig, who are braced for the departure of Sesko.",
      "With Newcastle struggling to acquire their preferred No 9 targets, Liverpool's hopes of landing Isak hang in the balance.",
      "The Reds are believed to be willing to smash the British transfer record for a second time this summer to sign Isak after previously agreeing to pay a sum in the region of £116million including add-ons to acquire Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Sesko was regarded as the type of statement signing who would, potentially, soften the blow of losing a player of Isak's quality. But the Slovenia striker's preference for a move to United could scupper - or at the very least delay - Liverpool's swoop for Isak.",

      "Benjamin Sesko's decision to ignore Manchester United's interest in favour of staying at RB Leipzig was deemed the correct one by Gary Neville. The 22-year-old joined the Bundesliga side in 2023 and made an instant impact, scoring 18 goals in all competitions in his first season.",
      "His impressive performances saw him subject to interest from the Premier League giants as well as Arsenal last summer. But the Slovenia international opted to remain in Germany and ended up signing a new deal.",
      "While there were reports that a gentleman's agreement existed between Sesko's camp and the club that would allow him to leave this year for a reasonable fee, his contract tied him down in Leipzig until 2029.",
      "Following his debut campaign in the Bundesliga, Sesko - who is nearing a move to Old Trafford this month - was in action at Euro 2024, and it was Neville who was on punditry duty for Slovenia's 1-1 draw with Denmark.",
      "The Manchester United legend discussed the forward's ability and admitted that his decision to stay in Germany, which was not confirmed at the time, was best for his personal development as a footballer.",
      "\"[He's got] goals, youth and physically,\" the ex-England defender said on ITV. \"I think we are moving back to having a big physical striker up front, the game seems to have flipped a little bit by having big defenders and big strikers.",
      "\"He is someone who has so much potential and you can see why Premier League clubs are interested. But I can also see why, what is being suggested, he is staying at Leipzig for another year.",
      "\"It will give him the chance to grow without the spotlight you get on you in the Premier League and just develop his game a little bit more,\" Neville added. While United could have done with Sesko's talents in what was a dismal campaign last season, the striker enjoyed another fruitful season with Leipzig, scoring 21 goals in all competitions and contributing six assists.",
      "The added experience Sesko's collected from leading the line for a European club in a top-five league and the Champions League may benefit United even more this season.",
      "The 6'5\" ace looked to be closing in on a transfer to Newcastle after the Magpies bid £72million plus £2.1m for his services, but he made clear his intention to join Ruben Amorim's side after their bid of £65m plus £8m was tabled, according to The Athletic.",
      "Sesko's insistence on signing for United has been relayed to all parties involved in the deal. Newcastle have now been left rueing another failed transfer as they look to reinforce their attacking reinforcements amid Alexander Isak's uncertain future following a rejected bid from Liverpool.",

      "Despite competition from Newcastle, the Red Devils are confident that Sesko favours a move to Old Trafford this summer and discussions are ongoing with Leipzig to seal a complete club-to-club agreement.",
      "United have tabled a €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7m) in add-ons bid in an attempt to secure Sesko. Newcastle have proposed a more lucrative package to Leipzig, but the player's preference is expected to be decisive.",
      "Sesko has been training separately from his teammates this week while negotiations over his future progress, and Leipzig confirmed on Wednesday morning that the 22-year-old was again working individually.",
      "United moving forward to sign Sesko means Rasmus Hojlund faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford. Hojlund has insisted he wants to stay and fight for his place, but United are ready to take a loss to sell him this summer. The MEN reported on Wednesday that Hojlund is resigned to being forced out by United if Sesko signs.",
      "Speaking about his future in the US, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",

      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "United have splashed out a combined £127.5million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer, and sealing a deal for Sesko would push their spending towards the £200m mark.",
      "Should a move for Sesko get the green light, Ruben Amorim will have transformed his frontline in just one window, after a campaign where United managed a measly 44 goals in the Premier League.",

      "Manchester United could play a major role in shaping Liverpool's summer transfer plans if they succeed in landing Benjamin Sesko. The Red Devils are in advanced talks to sign the RB Leipzig striker and look set to pip Newcastle to his signature.",
      "They have reportedly submitted a £65.2million bid for Sesko, which could potentially rise to £73.8m with add-ons. It falls a little short of Newcastle's bid - £69.7m up front, potentially rising to £75m with add-ons - which has been accepted by Leipzig.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim's side are confident of winning the race, with reports suggesting the 22-year-old Slovenian favours a move to Old Trafford over St James' Park. If they do, it would mark a major coup for a club who finished 15th in the Premier League last season - and yet another setback for Newcastle, who have already missed out on several high-profile attacking targets this summer.",
      "But the impact of this transfer won't be limited to Manchester United and Newcastle - Liverpool could also feel the ripple effects. Once Sesko is sold, RB Leipzig will be left somewhat short in attack and are expected to move swiftly in the transfer market for reinforcements.",
      "High on their wishlist is Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott, whose future at Anfield remains uncertain after spending much of last season on the bench. Elliott is being considered as a direct replacement for Xavi Simons - currently in talks over a move to Chelsea - but Sesko's departure could further accelerate Leipzig's push for attacking additions.",
      "Elliott is capable of playing in multiple position across midfield and in wide attacking areas - making him an attractive prospect. That said, he won't come cheap.",
      "According to The Athletic, Liverpool have told Leipzig they want at least £40m plus a buy-back clause for the 22-year-old, and will only drop said clause if they receive an offer in excess of £50m. The Reds aren't the only ones Leipzig will need to convince either. Elliott has previously expressed a desire to stay and fight for his place at Anfield, describing Liverpool as \"my club\".",
      "\"I'm not leaving. This is my team, this is my club,\" he said back in January. \"Liverpool is my club... I want to fight for my place... Help the team out... I am not going to give up, I am going to keep fighting.\"",
      "Saying that, his stance appears to have softened after failing to break into Slot's first team. In June, the midfielder admitted he was wary of \"wasting years of my career\", having made just seven starts in all competitions under the Dutchman.",
      "\"It's just a situation that me and the team have to have a conversation about because I'm coming into an age now where I'm 22, I'm going to be 23 next season,\" Elliott said. \"I don't really want to be wasting years on my career because it's a short career. You don't know what's going to happen.",
      "\"I need to reflect. I need to see if I'm content in doing what I'm doing and how can I can improve as a player because that's the most important thing.\"",
      "He clarified: \"Nothing makes me want to leave. I love the club, I love the fans, the team. I support them as well. But as I said, most importantly, it's just about what's best for my career.\"",
      "Previously, Elliott looked set to become a key figure at Liverpool. During Jurgen Klopp's final two years in charge, he made 99 appearances in all competitions - missing just 11 games. Still, Klopp said he regretted not starting Elliott more often.",
      "\"If I regret one thing a little bit it's that Harvey didn't play often enough maybe,\" the German said in May 2024. \"Because in a very important, intense period - January, a lot of injuries - he played really good. He was probably our best player, right wing, right midfield, all these kinds of things.\"",
      "A reunion of sorts with Klopp could be on the cards if Elliott makes the switch to Leipzig. Earlier this year, the former Liverpool manager took on a new role as Head of Global Football at Red Bull, overseeing the group's network of clubs - including RB Leipzig, Red Bull Salzburg, and the New York Red Bulls - where he provides strategic guidance to sporting directors, coaches, and scouting departments.",
      "Klopp's presence alone could make Leipzig an appealing destination for Elliott. But the Bundesliga club's strong reputation for developing young talent - and reviving the careers of players who've lost their way - adds further weight to the move.",

      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta is confident the club will be able to register Marcus Rashford and their other signings ahead before the new season starts. Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan this summer after he was frozen out at Manchester United by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The deal includes a £26m option to buy and involves Barcelona paying his wages in full. There were concerns that Barcelona may not be able to register Rashford due to their financial struggles.",
      "The club had issues registering Dani Olmo and Pau Victor last season, with their temporary licences getting revoked during the January transfer window after La Liga claimed the club had failed to prove they were compliant with their financial rules.",
      "Olmo was only able to be registered against after Spain's National Sports Council ruled that La Liga's decision was \"null and void\". Barcelona are yet to register and fellow new signings Joan Garcia and Roony Bardghji, but Laporta is not concerned about the situation.",
      "\"It's progressing well,\" Laporta told ESPN. \"We're doing our job and we're confident that we'll be able to register everyone.\"",
      "Rashford has also insisted he is not concerned, telling reporters: \"It's something for the club to sort out. I believe they are going to get it sorted. I just focus on training and be ready for the start of the season.\"",
      "Rashford recently scored his first goal for the club on their pre-season tour of Asia, finding the back of the net in their 3-1 win over Vissel Kobe on Sunday, and he is looking forward to the start of the new campaign.",

      "Manchester United have been urged to make a move for Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope amid ongoing uncertainty over Andre Onana's comeback date. United's No.1 has been sidelined for every pre-season fixture following a hamstring injury he picked up in training last month.",
      "Onana remains optimistic about being ready for the kick-off of the new Premier League campaign, though the Cameroonian could still be ruled out. Even if declared fit, question marks continue to hang over the 29-year-old's displays following a string of costly blunders last season.",
      "Former United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster has now urged his old side to pursue Pope, insisting they are \"crying out\" for fresh goalkeeping talent. The 10-cap England star moved to Newcastle from Burnley for £10million in 2022, though now faces a new rivalry for his spot after the Magpies sealed Aaron Ramsdale's arrival on loan from Southampton last week.",
      "\"Manchester United are absolutely crying out for a goalkeeper,\" Foster said on his Fozcast podcast. \"You'd do so much worse than getting Nick Pope. I think it would be a fantastic fit, I really do.",
      "\"If you're looking to get it to the forward areas as quickly as possible, Nick Pope's your boy and he'll stop goals. Onana's had this big injury at the start of pre-season and he's looking like he'll only get that fit maybe just for the start of the season.",
      "\"But you don't want that from your goalkeeper. You want him to have had four or five pre-season games and weeks and weeks of training.",
      "\"There were also a lot of questions raised at the end of last season thinking that he's probably not going to be the first choice goalkeeper. Nick Pope will be looking at this thinking, 'Hmm.'\".",
      "Pope has featured 95 times for Newcastle in all competitions, and Leeds United are amongst the clubs reportedly keen on the 33-year-old. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounds whether the Magpies would be prepared to sanction his departure, with Eddie Howe anticipated to use Ramsdale as competition for Pope rather than as his replacement.",
      "United have been connected with numerous shot-stoppers this summer, including AC Milan's Mike Maignan and Emiliano Martinez. The Daily Mail claimed earlier this summer that United even made a bold bid to secure Martinez from Aston Villa on loan, though prospects of a deal were swiftly extinguished.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim has utilised both Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton throughout pre-season owing to Onana's fitness concerns. Despite scrutiny surrounding United's current number one, Amorim voiced faith in Onana's capabilities last week and seemingly dismissed speculation that he's hunting for fresh competition.",
      "\"I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers,\" Amorim said. \"Even Tom is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper. Altay did really well, and Onana is going to be better, like the other guys, this year.",
      "\"I think we are better in every detail, in the organisation of the day-by-day. The nutrition is better, the way we cook, what we eat, how we prepare training.",
      "\"I think that we are more organised. I think we have people now that help us to be better. I'm not concerned with small things and I was last year.",
      "\"Those things help us and help me to think more about watching the game, watching the team. So it's a big help for me. When it's a big help for the technical staff, it's a big help for the players.\"",

      "Alan Shearer looks to have been left red-faced again after Benjamin Sesko snubbed Newcastle in favour of a move to Manchester United. Magpies legend Shearer claimed at the end of last season that the Red Devils would struggle to attract the game's top stars after missing out on Champions League football.",
      "This is a theory that has already been proven wrong by United's acquisition of several in-demand players this summer. Sesko, 22, has now become the latest player to turn down Newcastle, who are in the Champions League this season, after they bid twice for the RB Leipzig striker, leaving Shearer embarrassed all over again.",
      "Newcastle's second offer totalling £78million was accepted by the German side earlier this week. However, all parties are now fully aware of the Slovenian's preference to move to Old Trafford after Ruben Amorim's side offered a package worth up to £73.8m, with personal terms thought not to be an issue.",
      "Sesko's move heralds part-two of an epic climb-down for Shearer. After United's 1-0 loss to Tottenham in the Europa League final, and their 15th placed finish in the Premier League, the ex-England forward claimed they would find it tough to shop at the highest level.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, he said: \"They’re going to have to recruit very well because clearly a lot of these players are not good enough or not suited to that style of play. They’re a million miles off it on and off the pitch and I don’t know how they get out of this.",
      "\"How do they attract top players this summer and are they even going to be able to pay for them now they’re not in the Champions League? Why would big players want to go there?\"",
      "However, contrary to Shearer’s opinion, it seems Sesko has not been put off by the lack of European football on offer at United. While United have stolen a march on Sesko, the Red Devils also wrestled Matheus Cunha from the north east club's grasp earlier in the summer transfer window, while Bryan Mbeumo also spurned the Toon for Old Trafford.",
      "Despite signing Anthony Elanga for £55m from Nottingham Forest and securing Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan, Sesko is not the only player to turn down Newcastle boss Eddie Howe this summer. French striker Hugo Ekitike joined Liverpool from Eintracht Frankfurt after interest from the Magpies.",
      "Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford later signed for Manchester City after being eyed by Howe. Both Ipswich's Liam Delap and Brighton's Joao Pedro, who were fancied by Newcastle, joined Chelsea.",
      "Matters could yet worsen for the club with Liverpool thought to be preparing a second offer for Isak after their opening bid of £110m, inclusive of add-ons, was rejected.",
      "Shearer is also facing another humiliating back-track on that matter too after stating that Isak would be staying at Newcastle next season. This came before the Sweden international communicated his intentions to the Newcastle board that he wishes to play his football elsewhere.",
      "England international and Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins, 29, could now be an option for Newcastle after reported interest last month, as their need for a quality forward has intensified.",
      "Speaking on Isak's uncertain future, Howe said: \"I wouldn't put a timescale on it. I think with these situations, it has to be right for the football club, and everything then is taken into context below that. The manager of course has an opinion, but ultimately the decision will rest with the board.\"",

      "Gary Neville's hopes of Manchester United signing six new players look to be in tatters as the club closes in on a big-money deal for Benjamin Sesko. Ruben Amorim's side are the favourites to sign the Slovenian after he picked the Red Devils over Newcastle.",
      "The Magpies were seemingly in pole position to sign him after RB Leipzig accepted their £78million bid. United offered a package understood to be worth around £73.8m, which has yet to be accepted by the German side.",
      "Sesko will be the fourth signing to arrive at Old Trafford this summer, after Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. While some may consider this to be a successful window, Neville felt United needed at least six fresh faces, including two midfielders, after this disastrous campaign last term.",
      "There is a chance that United will bring in more bodies, as well as Sesko, before the window closes. However, most, if not all, of United's budget will have been accommodated to the Sesko deal, meaning Neville's hopes of at least two more signings look unlikely.",
      "United are expected to strengthen in the goalkeeping department next, but will likely only sign a backup for Andre Onana. Speaking before the Europa League final, Neville insisted that United would need a dramatic overhaul in the summer.",
      "\"Five or six players minimum [are needed] to be able to change the direction of how he (Amorim) wants to play,\" Neville said. \"There’s at least two forwards, a central midfield player, definitely two wing backs and another centre-back.",
      "\"They need six players minimum. Ruben has been very good at identifying the players he wants out of the club; that’s really clear to everybody. The club’s job now is to get them out and get replacements in that he likes and wants in his team.”",
      "Neville is not alone in thinking that United's recruitment team need to bring in more players. Gary Lineker insisted this week that they 'needed a lot more,' while Alan Shearer said on the Rest is Football podcast: “Two good signings… they need at least another three, I would say. They need a top-class centre-forward and goalkeeper.”",
      "If a move for Sesko is completed, United will have signed three forwards and one left-wing-back. However, in the case of 18-year-old Leon, it's currently uncertain as to whether United see him as a first-team player or as someone who will go into their under-21s side.",
      "If Sesko arrives, United's transfer outlay will surpass the £200m mark, likely closing their spending unless they can recoup some big fees for Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Despite Amorim significantly strengthening his attack, which was a real problem area for United last season, Neville won't be totally satisfied with their business, given that he wanted more midfielders and defenders to join the club.",
      "\"It would seem that what's happening now is Ruben Amorim is identifying players he does not want in the squad and he's moving them out. That's a positive and on paper I do like the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "\"Why do I like them? They've got Premier League experience, they look more like Manchester United styles of players with a bit more pace and power and the physicality to get from box to box quickly.",
      "\"I think when you look at Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are more jinkers, more people who work in tight spaces. I've always felt that United need players that can open their legs up and really stretch teams and I think Cunha and Mbeumo do that.\"",
      "United's new arrivals and current crop of stars will need to be at their best when the Premier League starts. They have home clashes against Arsenal, Burnley and Chelsea and away matches against Fulham, Manchester City and Brentford in their first six matches of the new campaign.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been warned against signing Benjamin Sesko and urged to bring in Ollie Watkins instead. The Red Devils look set to win the race for Sesko after it emerged that he has made it clear he would prefer to join them over Newcastle.",
      "However, former coach Rene Meulensteen, who worked at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson, is unconvinced by Sesko and believes the move is \"exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\".",
      "Hojlund joined the club from Atalanta back in 2023 but the 22-year-old has struggled to make much of an impact, managing just 26 goals in 95 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Speaking to Poker Strategy, Meulensteen said: \" Manchester United's bid for Benjamin Sesko is basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "\"If he scores in the first three or four games and hits the ground running then he could be the answer for the club, but there's a chance that won't happen. If you look at Hojlund, he joined Atalanta and performed well alongside the rest of the team and then joined United.",
      "\"The same can be said for Sesko – the Bundesliga is a very different league to the Premier League, so he'll need to adapt. Has Sesko got potential? 100%, but he's still young and developing and he isn't the finished article.\"",
      "Meulensteen instead believes that his former club would be better served signing Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins, who is a more proven commodity and has scored 75 goals in 184 Premier League appearances.",
      "\"I look at someone like Ollie Watkins who may be available,\" Meulensteen explained. \"He's a hard-working player with similar features to Sesko, except that he already has Premier League experience which is priceless.",
      "\"I think Sesko would probably cost more than Watkins too. Why doesn't the club bring in Watkins and allow the coaches to work closely with Hojlund to allow him to develop?",
      "\"It's a waste of an investment otherwise – they paid close to £80m for him and they're in danger of selling him for less than half of that unless he develops.\"",

      "Newcastle had an opening bid for Sesko rejected by RB Leipzig, but have since returned with an improved offer worth an initial £69.5million plus £8.6m in add-ons. The Red Devils, meanwhile, have also lodged a bid of £65.2m up front and £8.6m in add-ons.",
      "However, it is claimed that those in Manchester are confident that Sesko prefers a move to Old Trafford over a switch to Newcastle. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Sesko, but he is an exciting young prospect who has been compared to Haaland.",
      "Sesko did essentially replace Haaland at Red Bull Salzburg after he left the club for Borussia Dortmund and the Slovenia international has claimed that most of his team-mates believe that he is better.",
      "Addressing the comparisons, Sesko explained that his electric pace was the trait most similar to Haaland. \"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy,\" he said.",
      "\"They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn, so I can be even better than he is. My teammates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "Sesko also regards Haaland as one of his idols, adding: \"He's an amazing player, I've big respect for him and I usually watch many YouTube videos about him. I'm very happy I received Haaland's jersey. I want [to] keep it for my jersey collection. He also said 'well played', I was very happy.\"",
      "The Red Devils do have a potential edge over Newcastle in the form of Christopher Vivell, who is currently working as their director of recruitment. Vivell has been credited for discovering Sesko when he was at Salzburg and spearheading their move for the striker.",
      "And Vivell has previously stated that Sesko is a \"special player\" who has \"enormous potential\". Speaking back in 2022, Vilvell said: \"Benjamin Sesko is among the game's top young talents and has enormous potential to become a top player.",
      "\"He has all the qualities to do that. He's extremely quick, has a great jump on him and is strong in the air. Benjamin is a real goalscorer, who despite his 1.95m (6'4\") is mobile and technically strong. His abilities make him a special player with a special profile.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has introduced a new rule to training at Manchester United - the losers pick up ALL the equipment used that day.",
      "The Portuguese manager's debut campaign after taking over from Erik ten Hag last November proved to be a disaster. However, things have been looking up for him in pre-season, with United winning the Premier League Summer Series in the USA. They recorded victories over West Ham United and Bournemouth, while also drawing 2-2 with Everton.",
      "Amorim has been cutting no corners in his quest to transform United, who were so often criticised last season. One of his methods has been bringing a competitive edge to training drills, to introduce a more intense environment. And one key factor has been the use of forfeits for losing teams, which normally involves requiring them to pick up the equipment from the day's training.",
      "United young star Toby Collyer has commented specifically on the rule, telling The Athletic: \"Everyone wants to be the team that wins. You don't have to get the gear in then. It's a jeopardy if you lose! All the other teams have to get the gear in.\"",
      "Right-back Diogo Dalot also discussed how the standards in pre-season have been raised compared to last term. The Portugal international said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.\"",
      "It comes alongside Amorim's work to enhance his players' understanding of his preferred 3-4-3 formation. The United boss refused to budge from his favourite set-up last term, even when the team's form was at its lowest. And now he is doubling down.",
      "He sets out his defenders in his preferred back five, with substitute defenders standing behind his starters as he shifts them left and right by kicking the ball into a particular area of the pitch. It can be a time-consuming and laborious process, but Amorim is fully focused on the details.",
      "Another area of the pitch where United were regularly outclassed was in midfield. This season, Amorim believes his players will be able to dominate the middle of the park.",
      "When asked why he is feeling so confident, he said: \"I think it's the time to train. Even the certainty of the movements can help a player to be faster, if you are thinking, 'I jump, I don't jump.'",
      "\"We train when they need to jump; they already know. Sometimes it's one metre, one second. That is something that the tactical aspect and the physical aspect are together.\"",
      "United face an ominous start to the new Premier League campaign. On the first day of the season, they host title-chasing Arsenal at Old Trafford before a difficult trip to Fulham the following week.",
      "A home clash against newly promoted Burnley is swiftly followed by an away clash against Manchester City and then another home match against Chelsea. These games will be the biggest test of whether Amorim's methods have been absorbed by his players.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "All parties are now aware of Sesko's preference to move to Old Trafford, as first reported by the Athletic. Ruben Amorim's side offered a total package of £73.8m, so they'll need to negotiate with Leipzig in order to reach a club-to-club agreement.",
      "Personal terms aren't expected to be an issue, as the Red Devils' pursuit of a striker nears a successful conclusion. Sesko - who Old Trafford chiefs have had on their radar since he was playing for Slovenian club Domzale aged 16 - was a target for Arsenal before the Gunners opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "In that case, it was Amorim who missed out, having coached the Swede at Sporting Lisbon. They then looked into signing Ollie Watkins, although Aston Villa were demanding £60m.",
      "At 29, the Red Devils didn't feel that he represented good value. England international Watkins could now be an option for Newcastle, who are preparing for life without Alexander Isak after he informed club officials that he wants to leave.",
      "Liverpool are preparing a second offer for Isak after their opening bid of £120m, inclusive of add-ons, was rejected last week. Like Sesko, Isak has been training alone amid the race to sign him.",
      "The Slovenian's move to Manchester could also signal the departure of Rasmus Hojlund, who's available for just £30m after two underwhelming seasons. Sesko would be part of a new-look forward line at Old Trafford including summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The pair were both linked with moves to Newcastle but chose to work with Amorim, despite the Magpies boasting Champions League football. Other targets who Newcastle missed out on include James Trafford, Hugo Ekitike and Joao Pedro.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund did not arrive with Premier League experience and his time at Old Trafford has not gone as hoped. There is also no guarantee that Benjamin Sesko will succeed in England.",
      "United are rolling the dice with Sesko after Aston Villa reiterated Ollie Watkins was not for sale this summer. Watkins would have been a similar signing to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who are both established Premier League players, but talks are advancing with RB Leipzig over a move for Sesko.",
      "United have bid €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7) in add-ons in an attempt to sign Sesko. Newcastle have offered a more lucrative package to Leipzig, but the player's preference is set to be decisive.",
      "The expectation is that United and Leipzig will agree on a slightly higher fee than the initial bid.",
      "Fans who have been season-ticket holders at Old Trafford for years will wonder how paying such a significant fee for a raw striker is now considered normal, but the modern market is grossly inflated.",
      "United will essentially pay the going rate for one of the most promising young forwards in Europe, but they are investing in potential and Hojlund is an example of the danger of those deals.",
      "Watkins would have been a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. Watkins has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England at Euro 2024.",
      "There would have been a higher chance of Watkins hitting the ground running at United, but that point is redundant when Aston Villa always seemed destined to say he wasn't for sale.",
      "In comparison, Sesko had earmarked this summer for a move away from Leipzig and Arsenal were the front-runners to sign him at the start of the window. Arsenal opted to sign Viktor Gyökeres from Sporting Lisbon instead, which opened the door for United and Newcastle to battle it out for Sesko.",
      "It doesn't make much sense to harp on about Watkins being more suited to a transfer to United than Sesko because one player wasn't for sale, and the other player was up for grabs.",
      "Having said that, concerns can be voiced about Sesko's move. He is younger than Hojlund and will need time to adapt in the Premier League. Will history repeat itself and the pressure of leading the attack become a burden on Sesko's shoulders? It's possible his time at United will be similar to Hojlund's.",
      "On the other hand, it's entirely possible that Sesko is better equipped to succeed at Old Trafford and makes an immediate impact, scoring goals and providing presence in the opposition box.",
      "Amorim will desperately hope it's the latter. United's head coach needs a dependable goalscorer and Sesko should be targeting 15 goals in his first season.",
      "Christopher Vivell has been crucial in the proposed deal for Sesko, to the extent that Sesko will feel like a 'Vivell signing'. United's director of recruitment oversaw the signing of Sesko during his stint at Leipzig and holds him in high regard.",
      "And when Leipzig signed Sesko in the summer of 2022, Vivell said: \"Sesko is among the top international talents and has enormous potential to become a top player as well. He has everything it takes, is extremely fast, has tremendous jumping ability, and is very strong in the air.\"",
      "Vivell believes Sesko can develop into one of the world's best strikers, but United sources said the same when Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in a deal worth £72million two years ago.",
      "It will be a disaster if Sesko isn't a success in Manchester, given that his profile is similar to Hojlund's, albeit he has shown more than Hojlund did before his move to United.",
      "Sesko has 39 goals in 87 appearances for RB Leipzig and his record for Slovenia (16 goals in 41 games) is encouraging. Sesko was a livewire at Euro 2024 and his explosiveness will help him in the Premier League.",
      "The 22-year-old could prove to be an outstanding signing if he continues to develop in the next few seasons. Sesko obviously comes with risk but there is plenty of potential there.",
      "Every United fan will be hoping lightning does not strike twice.",

      "Speaking about his future in the US, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "United have spent a combined £127.5million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer, and completing a deal for Sesko would bring spending close to the £200m mark.",
      "If a transfer for Sesko is rubber-stamped, Ruben Amorim will have overhauled his attack in a single window, following a season in which United mustered just 44 goals in the Premier League.",

      "Newcastle have offered a higher package to the Bundesliga outfit, but Sesko's preference is set to be decisive.

      "Newcastle are gearing up for a return to the Champions League under Eddie Howe next season, while United will not be offering any European football. Nonetheless, there is hope that Sesko is eager to join Ruben Amorim's squad as they aim to bounce back from a disastrous 2024/25 season under the former Sporting head coach.",
      "Below is all the latest on Sesko's potential move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Sesko has trained away from his teammates this week while talks over his future advance. And Leipzig confirmed on Wednesday morning that the 22-year-old was working individually again.",
      "In a short statement, the German club said: \"Wednesday squad update: Andrija Maksimovic is back in Leipzig, but is training individually today. Benjamin Sesko and Lukas Klostermann are also working individually.\"",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano, who specialises in transfers, has provided an update on the deal - claiming that Leipzig maybe looking to extend the negotiations to extract a higher fee.",
      "\"Christopher Vivell is working on this deal because he knows the Red Bull group very well, but also Jason Wilcox is being crucial once again in these conversations and negotiations,\" he said in a video on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"He is now taking care of the structure of the deal with RB Leipzig to change maybe the structure of add-ons, to make it almost guaranteed, the main part of the transfer fee for RB Leipzig.",
      "\"So work in progress to reach an agreement club-to-club and then to complete the transfer of Benjamin Sesko. The big signing for United is coming.",
      "\"There is a feeling that RB Leipzig want to extend the negotiations because they want to get the best price possible. Manchester United have a good relationship with Leipzig, so they hope this will not be very long.",
      "\"So let's see, it can really be any moment because the two clubs are in direct contact and then Sesko is expected to become a new Manchester United player.\"",
      "The MEN understands that Reds forward Rasmus Hojlund is resigned to being forced out by United if Sesko completes a move to Old Trafford. It was revealed in May that the club had planned to sell Hojlund amid their interest in recruiting a new striker.",
      "Sources close to the Denmark international concede that if Hojlund is unwanted, it could lift his game, but ultimately, he will have to seek a move before the transfer deadline on September 1. The Danish striker said in Chicago last week he planned to stay at the Reds but head coach Ruben Amorim refused to confirm if he would keep a player United bought in a £72m deal from Atalanta two years ago.",
      "United's director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, worked alongside a young Sesko during his time at RB Salzburg and the Slovenia international clearly made an instant impression. In his analysis of the 22-year-old, Vivell claimed Sesko has all the attributes to become one of the world's leading players.",
      "\"Benjamin Sesko is among the game's top young talents - and has enormous potential to become a top player,\" Vivell said, per Bundesliga.com. He has all the qualities to do that. He's extremely quick, has a great jump on him and is strong in the air.",
      "\"Benjamin is a real goalscorer, who despite his 1.95m (6ft 4in height) is mobile and technically strong. His abilities make him a special player with a special profile.\"",
      "United first tried to sign Sesko three years ago; however, a £21million deal was already in place for the striker to leave RB Salzburg after four years in Austria.",
      "Sesko addressed interest from United, during a 2023 interview with The Telegraph, before RB Leipzig played Manchester City in that year's Champions League group stages. \"The thing is, I was not really into that kind of conversation, but I think it was better just to come here,\" the Slovenia international said.",

      "Manchester United are set to be one of the busiest Premier League clubs in the final stretch of the summer transfer window after spending £120million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United have bid €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7m) in add-ons, a deal which would see their spending surpass the £185m mark. There has also been recent speculation linking them with Carlos Baleba after his impressive displays at Brighton.",
      "Baleba is the latest talent to develop at Brighton after being snapped up at a low price. Unfortunately for United, the £23.2m they paid Lille for him two years ago is nowhere near the fee they will have to pay.",
      "According to TBR Football, there is no release clause in the Cameroonian's contract and it could cost the Reds over £100m to sign him. The signing of Sesko will take United's summer spending to more than £185m meaning players have to be sold to raise funds.",
      "Baleba is valued at €87m (£75.9m) by CIES Football Observatory.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"United have to be careful that they don't overspend here. PSR concerns and no European income means anything close to £100m is highly unlikely. However, with amortisation and the luxury revenue income at Old Trafford, it isn't impossible.",
      "\"Amorim and the recruitment team just need to be certain that the Brighton ace will improve their midfield. They have Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro to do a similar role so selling one of them wouldn't be the worst thing.\"",
      "If United miss out on Sesko like they did Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, Amorim is reportedly planning to raid Liga Portugal with the signing of Benfica's Vangelis Pavlidis, according to The Sun [via Give Me Sport].",
      "The Greek international scored 19 league goals last term, helping them finish second and win the Portuguese Super Cup. He only joined Benfica last summer and at 26, could be the perfect striker for United.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"If United missed out on Sesko, they should go for Ollie Watkins. Moving for Pavlidis wouldn't make much sense. He scored a decent amount of goals in Portugal but Gyokeres outscored him and there are doubts about whether he can translate that to the Premier League.",
      "\"Watkins is proven in England. Pavlidis is the sort of profile that needs a season or two with a club like West Ham before a move to Old Trafford.\"",

      "Brighton & Hove Albion chief executive Paul Barber has played down speculation that Manchester United have been in contact over the possibility of signing Carlos Baleba.",
      "Reports on Wednesday night have claimed that United have contacted the Seagulls, via intermediaries, to explore the conditions for a move for the midfielder.",
      "Baleba has three years left on his current deal at the AMEX Stadium and is one of the most sought-out youngsters in his position after moving to Lille. It's understood that Brighton want to keep the Cameroon international for at least another year while United need to sell players to afford further additions.",
      "On Wednesday evening, Brighton held their annual pre-season Fans' Forum with head coach Fabian Hurzeler and Barber taking questions ahead of the new Premier League season. Asked if this summer would be the right time to sell the 21-year-old, Barber revealed an insight into the current situation regarding Baleba and United.",
      "After Hurzeler jokingly seemed to avoid the question for Barber to answer, the Seagulls chief, via BBC Sussex, said: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players.",
      "\"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",
      "\"If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a very competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Each deal has provided varied circumstances. Leon's agreement to move to England from Paraguay was finalised in January and Cunha became signing number one of the summer quickly.",

      "Baleba, who has three years left on his contract, is one of the most highly-rated youngsters in his position and has replaced Moises Caicedo in Brighton's midfield. It has been noted, however, that Brighton want to keep the Cameroon international for at least another year.",
      "There has been some speculation coming out of Africa that Brighton have agreed to let Baleba depart if the price is substantial.",

      "Barcelona have been struck by Marcus Rashford fever ever since the Englishman completed his loan transfer from Manchester United this summer.",

      "The 27-year-old has gone on to make three pre-season appearances for Hansi Flick's side, most recently scoring for the first time in Blaugrana colours in a friendly against South Koeran outfit Daegu.",

      "They are said to be confident of finding common ground, and their next offer is reputedly worth over £40million. However, serious consideration is now purportedly being given to alternatives by the club so they are not caught out.",
      "La Gazetta dello Sport claims Inter are starting their search with Christopher Nkunku, but his former Chelsea teammate, Sancho, is reportedly the name gaining most traction. The report highlights that the winger would cost significantly less than Lookman or Nkunku, describing his £22million transfer fee as 'low'.",
      "Securing such a fee for Sancho would be a welcome boost and help offset any outlay on Benjamin Sesko. At one stage Juventus seemed the likeliest destination for the United outcast.",
      "However, their general director Damien Comolli recently claimed they \"have two of the best wingers in the world in [Kenan] Yildiz and [Francisco] Conceicao, plus Nico [Gonzalez] who's an excellent player. If anyone leaves, we'll be ready for the transfer market.\"",

      "The Magpies are gearing up for a campaign in the Champions League under Eddie Howe while United won't be offering any European football. However, there's hope that Sesko is eager to join Ruben Amorim's squad as they aim to bounce back from a disastrous 2024/25 season under the former Sporting head coach.",
      "Leipzig, meanwhile, confirmed on Wednesday that the 22-year-old is continuing training alone as he looks to resolve his future. The Slovenian has taken a very different approach to some of the other big-name strikers when they have been surrounded by transfer speculation - providing Amorim with positive signs.",
      "Former Reds-linked Viktor Gyokeres went on strike at Sporting amid a dispute over the transfer fee he was permitted to depart for. The former Coventry City forward eventually joined Premier League rivals Arsenal.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres' compatriot at Newcastle, Alexander Isak, was left out of the club's pre-season tour of Asia before travelling to train in Spain instead of staying in the North East.",
      "The pair will have had their reasons for taking the actions they did, and it's important to note that Isak has since returned to Newcastle amid interest from Liverpool. But Sesko's approach to sealing a summer exit has been very different to both players as he continues to train at his club.",
      "And Amorim's recent comments suggest that United have completed thorough checks on his character before accelerating their interest. It comes after previous claims that the Reds have faced attitude problems, fallouts and dressing room leaks with their squad.",
      "\"It is a key point in our way of doing things now,\" he told club media at United's training base in Chicago this summer.",
      "\"It's not just how they play. It's really important how they play, of course, because that is their job, but their character is really important.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to get to know the players and talk with everybody before we brought players into our group. That is going to be a rule and will be massive in our decision to sign a player.\"",
      "United will be hoping that their assessments of Sesko's character will translate into goals and provide the much-needed boost Amorim so badly needs in 2025/26.",

      "United will welcome the Gunners to M16 for their season curtain-raiser on Sunday, August 17.",
      "The 1958, who have organised numerous demonstrations and protests against United's ownership down the years, will march to Old Trafford with new banners being produced reading 'Jim Can't Fix This'.",
      "Ratcliffe secured a minority stake in United last year and the club has since been forced to navigate choppy waters since.",
      "The workforce has been slashed and numerous other unpopular decisions have been made across the board.",
      "A spokesman for The 1958 said: \"It's a new season but the same old ownership issues. Twenty years of the Glazers and their debt mountain is 20 years too long. Enough is enough.",
      "\"We won't allow some natural optimism and a couple of shiny new signings to deflect from the bigger off-field picture. Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and in our opinion is helping keep them in charge.",
      "\"So on 17th August, we protest not just against the Glazers, but now also against Jim Ratcliffe – a man once seen by many, including ourselves, as a possible saviour, a beacon of hope but now revealed as complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is.",
      "\"This is no longer just about ownership; this is about survival – the survival of our identity, our community, and our values.\"",
      "The spokesman added the protest is for \"every fan who has been silenced, evicted, priced out and disregarded\", adding \"this is about the future of football\".",
      "\"Jim Ratcliffe, you have chosen your side and it is not ours,\" The 1958 member continued. \"You now stand shoulder to shoulder with the Glazers.",
      "\"The mask has slipped. You are no saviour. You’re like a (red) devil in disguise.\"",

      "However, it seems that more clubs have emerged as potential destinations before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Spanish news outlet, Cadena SER, have claimed that Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus could pursue a move for Antony this summer. It has been claimed that Antony may consider a move to either of the duo, or a club that plays in the Champions League, provided a suitable offer is made.",
      "Antony is also continuing to be linked with a move to Saudi Arabia with unnamed clubs in the Saudi Pro League apparently interested in the former Ajax star.",
      "A return to Betis is still on the cards - according to the report - with another loan deal being suggested between United and the Spanish outfit. It remains to be seen where Antony will be playing his football next season, having not played for United since the 3-1 defeat to Brighton in the Premier League back in January.",
      "United have moved mountains to add to their ranks in attacking quarters this summer. After striking up deals for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, they are now closing in on a transfer for RB Leipzig's striker, Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Manchester United will have a new transfer priority if a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko is completed.",
      "Signing the Slovenian striker will eat up a large chunk of available funds for Ruben Amorim, and United will need to be mindful of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). So far this summer, the Reds have only managed to offload Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "The Catalan club are paying 100 per cent of Rashford's wages during his 12-month loan spell and have the option to sign him on a permanent deal. The deal is thought to save United around £12million and that will no doubt play a role in their ability to afford a move for Sesko.",
      "But where would the arrival of RB Leipzig's star forward leave the struggling Rasmus Hojlund? United's Danish striker has looked completely out of his depth across much of the past few seasons since joining from Atalanta in August 2023.",
      "Tuesday marks the two-year anniversary since his signing at M16 was announced. Much has changed since then for both club and player - with both seemingly at odds with what they now want.",
      "The player himself meanwhile appears less keen to leave. Hojlund insisted during United's recent pre-season tour that he intends to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "Elsewhere, Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move away. The MEN reported earlier this summer that Amorim had told the 21-year-old he could leave the club.",
      "It follows Garnacho's complaint about not getting enough playing time in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli and English top-flight rivals Chelsea have shown the most interest as he continues to train away from the senior squad. However, neither club has made a move so far.",
      "If United can sell both players, then the Reds could receive a much-needed £60m cash boost after potentially spending over £70m on Sesko. Signing a new midfielder should then be where United turn to although time is running out before the summer window closes on September 1.",

      "Old Trafford or St James' Park? That is the question facing Benjamin Sesko right now.",
      "With just under four weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, the RB Leipzig striker finds himself at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "Both clubs are determined to strengthen their respective forward lines ahead of the September 1 deadline and Sesko has emerged as a leading target for the pair of them.",
      "After finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer.",
      "They have brought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively, but they are still missing the most importance piece of the jigsaw in the form of a recognised centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who United are open to selling for £30million, regressed last season, scoring just ten goals in all competitions. Fellow attacker Joshua Zirkzee, who arrived from Bologna last summer, scored seven goals and is not a centre-forward.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap in early-June, United have since been chasing shadows in their striker search. However, it was never unrealistic to suggest sourcing their most important signing could take the most amount of time.",
      "Right now, Sesko occupies top spot on United's wish list. However, unlike Newcastle, they are yet to table a formal offer for the Slovenian international, who scored 21 goals for Leipzig last season.",
      "United do not want to get drawn into a bidding war for the striker, and understandably so, and it is believed they want assurances from Sesko that he wants to move to Old Trafford before potentially making an opening offer.",
      "Despite already spending more than £130m this summer, United are confident of financing a deal for Sesko before overseeing sales. United expect to save £14m this season on Marcus Rashford's wages, they have banked £5m from Chelsea's decision not to sign Jadon Sancho permanently and have raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses inserted in previous sales.",
      "In a better financial position than what was originally anticipated at the start of the window, United have resources available to them to sign Sesko. But is he worth the fee Leipzig are demanding?",
      "As with any transfer pursuit, United's interest in Sesko has split opinion. Many recognise his high ceiling and potential, and also acknowledge his respectable goalscoring record in Germany and Austria, but can United afford to take such a big risk at this moment in time?",
      "On one hand, supporters are within their rights to say yes, acknowledging the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, of which 35 were scored in the Premier League. On the flip side, others believe United should go for somebody who is more established and proven, no doubt mindful of the gamble United took on Hojlund two years ago.",
      "Last week, it was confirmed Ollie Watkins had also made his way onto United's list of options, but Aston Villa are currently refusing to sell him. He has three years left on his contract and scored 16 Premier League goals last season.",
      "However, if United are capable of throwing big-money at Leipzig in an attempt to sign Sesko, they will almost certainly have the funds available to try and change Villa's stance.",
      "Watkins is seven years Sesko's senior, meaning his ceiling is not as high, but what he does boast is a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Despite never scoring 20 goals or more in a Premier League campaign, the England international has reached double figures in each of the last five seasons since joining Villa in 2020, scoring 75 league goals. He has plundered 87 goals in all competitions for Villa.",
      "At 29, Watkins is not necessarily as attractive a signing as what Sesko would be, but there is a stronger likelihood of him coming in and hitting the ground running. He has scored 35 Premier League goals in the last two seasons, assisting 21.",
      "Having already swooped for two of the Premier League's best players in Mbeumo and Cunha this summer, Watkins would be a fitting addition to come in and spearhead United's attack.",
      "Sesko currently sits at the top of the wish list, but it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to Watkins and his record.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Jackson could be allowed to depart Chelsea this summer, after the west Londoners added more strikers to their squad. The signings of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap could see Jackson be allowed to leave Stamford Bridge before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Despite that back-up suggestion, though, it appears to be all-systems-go for Sesko at United.",

      "Three games, two wins, one draw, eight goals and one trophy marked a positive pre-season tour for Manchester United as they won the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.",
      "Beyond the results and performances, United have looked fitter than at this stage in recent years, the manager is secure and no clouds are hovering over the squad.",
      "United's schedule was more streamlined and Chicago was a perfect base. The Endeavor Health Performance Center they trained at only opened this year and the players could socialise in a superb city with next-to-no hassle.",
      "The past fortnight has provided a promising platform for a successful season. With the transfer window open for four more weeks, United are certain to be active with incomings and outgoings and there are unaddressed issues that were apparent before they took off for Chicago.",
      "Here are five talking points from their tour:",
      "Bruno Fernandes, typically, was one of three players to start all three tour games and scored three goals. Fernandes ended the match against Everton in midfield, where he started against Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "Fernandes will flitter between the No.10 and the No.8 over the course of the season as United have a surfeit of options to play behind the striker. Even when Matheus Cunha operated as the false nine against Everton, Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Mason Mount had stints as one of the 10s.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another option as Amorim ponders how to enhance a midfield arguably as in urgent need of an upgrade as up front. Whenever Fernandes eventually departs United, they are not going to require a playmaker for a while.",
      "United's intention to loan out Toby Collyer all but confirms a midfield recruit is lined up. Amorim criticised the \"lack of pace\" in the area after the goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and he hooked Mainoo before the hour mark against Everton.",
      "The bigger issue in the 2-2 draw was Manuel Ugarte, who was stuck against the Toffees. Everton preyed on Ugarte's limitations and he wilted against an aggressive press. Ugarte sought protection from the referee and when he attempted to match Everton's physicality he committed an obvious foul.",
      "Casemiro is undeniably a squad player and not even in the new six-man leadership group, having been a part of it under Erik ten Hag. Collyer's three career starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One. Amorim has belief in Mainoo but seems caught between two stools as to his role.",
      "Amorim suggested he was \"happy\" that United underperformed against Everton, easily the least accomplished of their performances, as the players would not be lulled into a false sense of security back at Carrington. This has been a buoyant United tour but the midfield has to be improved.",
      "United's second-best player last season was another playmaker and Amad started behind Rasmus Hojlund in Chicago. In the other two games, he was on the right wing and that appears to be the role Amorim has settled on for him.",
      "Amorim had Geovany Quenda to service Viktor Gyokeres in his final months at Sporting and Amad is a similar profile: a young left-footed winger expected to assume defensive responsibilities whilst offering attacking intent down the right-hand side.",
      "With £133.5million worth of new forwards and the totemic Fernandes in the attacking trident against Everton, United had dexterous playmakers to drop deep and spring through Amad, playing on the shoulder of the last defender. It led to a chance for Cunha and the penalty that Fernandes converted.",
      "Amad played on the wing in Amorim's first United match in charge at Ipswich. Four other wingers are in the bomb squad, either unwilling or incapable of meeting Amorim's demands.",
      "Another 'hidden' attacking asset is Leny Yoro, who is literally stepping up and playing more on the front foot.",
      "One of the last kicks from Rasmus Hojlund in the States was his boot against the post. He was appalled that Patrick Dorgu had shot at goal rather than gone across goal.",
      "Dorgu was well within his rights to shoot. Hojlund may have strayed offside, too. We have become accustomed to that reaction from Hojlund and he vented at Diogo Dalot in Stockholm a little over two weeks ago.",
      "It cannot be easy for Hojlund to continue as United's No.9 when they are enquiring about almost any attainable striker. He is in an identical position to Erik ten Hag last year when United asked every Tom, Dick and Harry if they would take over as manager. Ten Hag remained in situ after the head-hunting but was eventually summoned to the guillotine.",
      "Hojlund is digging his heels in amid United's efforts to flog him but it is unsustainable and could jeopardise the squad harmony. Hojlund was socialising with Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as recently as United's penultimate night in Chicago. United need to be transparent with the Dane.",
      "This has been the most upbeat United pre-season since 2017. The quirk of that is United entered that summer having just won the Europa League final.",
      "Denying the 'bomb squad' members a seat on the plane to Chicago has indubitably helped. The players have publicly backed Amorim's handling of players who have caused him and the club problems. United are not treading on eggshells with Marcus Rashford any more after he was whisked away to Barcelona.",
      "Ten Hag had Jadon Sancho foisted onto him for pre-season last year and his working relationship with Rashford was practically irreparable. Senior figures at United want to provide unequivocal backing for Amorim and his authority is yet to be challenged over his handling of a player.",
      "The days when Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba rode roughshod over the manager are thankfully over.",
      "Andre Onana is expected to be match-fit for the Arsenal fixture but if he isn't then a 39-year-old deserves to be between the sticks for United.",
      "This tour was additional evidence that Altay Bayindir is the third-best of United's senior 'keepers. In a summer where United are exploring the possibility of recruiting a new goalie, it is peculiar that they are not actively looking to shift Bayindir, whose reputation hinges on a couple of penalty saves in a cup tie.",
      "Bayindir was utterly unconvincing again in the draw with Everton whereas Tom Heaton kept competently against Bournemouth. Onana has to demonstrate clear evidence that he has honed his technique when he does return and the first-choice goalkeeper position can be parked for a year.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "The report also claims that interested parties have been told the likelihood is that Maguire is likely to extend his contract. It is also claimed that the England international, 32, wants to spend the rest of his career at Old Trafford.",

While there is no club-to-club agreement yet, the situation is moving in that direction.’",
      "United’s push to sign a new No.9 has put Hojlund’s future at the club in doubt, with the club bosses now said to be more than open to his sale.",
      "After scoring in the pre-season win over Bournemouth last week, Hojlund said: “I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused, and then obviously we’ll see what happens.”",
      "“I think my plan is very clear, and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22.",
      "“Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",

      "Ex-Red Devils assistant Rene Meulensteen believes his former side should have instead pushed to sign Ollie Watkins.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Manchester United’s bid for Benjamin Sesko is basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund. If he scores in the first three or four games and hits the ground running then he could be the answer for the club, but there’s a chance that won’t happen.",
      "“If you look at Hojlund, he joined Atalanta and performed well alongside the rest of the team and then joined United.  The same can be said for Sesko – the Bundesliga is a very different league to the Premier League, so he’ll need to adapt. Has Sesko got potential? 100%, but he’s still young and developing and he isn’t the finished article.”",
      "Meulensteen added: “I look at someone like Ollie Watkins who may be available. He’s a hard-working player with similar features to Sesko, except that he already has Premier League experience which is priceless. I think Sesko would probably cost more than Watkins too.",
      "“Why doesn’t the club bring in Watkins and allow the coaches to work closely with Hojlund to allow him to develop? It’s a waste of an investment otherwise – they paid close to £80m for him and they’re in danger of selling him for less than half of that unless he develops.”",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nHaving missed out on Sesko, it makes sense that Newcastle would switch to Man Utd’s alternative target, especially now Villa are closing a deal for a new striker of their own. Newcastle’s problem now, though, is that Villa know how much they were prepared to pay for Sesko. So, if it happens, it will be on Villa’s terms.",

      "",
      "19) Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Jeremy Jacquet – Rennes to Arsenal\nAnother defender, Mikel? That’s insane. Arsenal’s interest in Jacquet will only be accelarated should Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior leave. The latter is attracting interest from all over Europe, but Arteta wants to keep him. Arsenal even rejected an offer from Portugal earlier this summer for the Pole, who’s destined for a place on this rumour ranking very, very soon. A fresh report has suggested Arsenal could sign Jacquet and loan him back to Rennes, William Saliba style. This rumour just became more realistic…",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIt looks like Newcastle are about to take another gargantuan L but when you’re rivalling Man Utd, there’s always hope they will screw up until it’s signed and sealed.",
      "MORE: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Let’s see who blinks first…",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £40m but Liverpool remain his preferred destination.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThere are no negotiations between United and Chelsea but Romano says the winger is giving his ‘full priority’ to the Club World Cup winners. The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave. This club, man…",
      "",
      "12) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",

      "",
      "7) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 John Victor – Botafogo to West Ham\nThere is a ‘verbal agreement’ for Big John to join the Hammers. No, not the guy from The Inbetweeners. Though with West Ham, you never can be sure. The Brazilian will by vying for Alphonse Areola’s No.1 spot…",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nA deal has been agreed with Al-Hilal to take Nunez to Saudi for £56million. PIF paying Liverpool big money – over the odds? –  so they can buy Alexander Isak is quite the situation. Given Nunez was so keen to remain in Europe, this one could have a twist yet.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nWe await confirmation but all the whispers suggest Sesko has chosen United over Newcastle after both clubs submitted their offers to RB Leipzig. It looks like a win for United but we remain to be convinced…",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Evann Guessand – Nice to Aston Villa\nThe Villans have been linked quite a bit but an agreement with Nice came out of nowhere in the end. The Nice striker will join for £30m, which could open the door for Watkins to depart.",
      "",
      "2) Armando Broja and Lesley Ugochukwu – Chelsea to Burnley\nIt will be permanent moves for Broja and Ugochukwu, with announcements expected any day now. Rumours are that Chelsea will bank £20million for Broja. Far less than the £50million he was once valued but still more than he’s worth.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Heung-min Son – Tottenham to LAFC\nThe Spurs captain will end a spectacular time in north London by becoming the most expensive signing in MLS history. And Tottenham will shift their highest earner. Which is nice for Daniel Levy."

      "Including three Manchester United outcasts and several Arsenal targets, these are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders. Oh, and centre-backs. Plus defensive midfielders.",
      "10) Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)\nManchester United need to sell Sancho and he certainly is an available winger. Juventus have been linked with a while but it’s all very quiet regarding the ex-Borussia Dortmund man’s future.",
      "",
      "9) Antony (Manchester United)\nThe Red Devils have managed to offload Marcus Rashford, who dropped out of this ranking after agreeing a move to Barcelona.",
      "Antony impressed during a productive loan spell at Real Betis in the second half of last season. The Spanish club want him permanently, and the Brazilian is keen on the move. They’re a great fit.",
      "",
      "8) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nWe are three for three for United players on the chopping block. Garnacho is reportedly valued at a staggering £60million — a figure that feels wildly inflated for a player who underperformed last season and comes with baggage. But at just 21 years old, he still holds plenty of promise.",
      "Garnacho wasn’t alone in struggling at Old Trafford; very few besides Bruno Fernandes stood out. But unless Sir Jim Ratcliffe lowers his valuation, United might be forced to keep or loan him out, risking a repeat of this summer’s dilemma in 2026.",
      "",
      "7) Maghnes Akliouche (AS Monaco)\nThe 23-year-old had a solid campaign with Monaco, regiestering five goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1. He’s earned six caps for France, which is no small feat, and was recently linked with a move to Arsenal. That interest seems to have cooled after the Gunners picked up Noni Madueke.",
      "Still, Akliouche is available…for a steep £70million. He’s not cheap, but he’s fantastic.",
      "",
      "6) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "5) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale — meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is underwhelming. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "4) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon might be safe from relegation, but they’re still resigned to losing Belgian winger Fofana this summer. Saying that, there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, he is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out — they’ve welcomed Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer — but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How did they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight in January?",
      "With Grealish likely off and Jeremy Doku not fully convincing, Man City could come calling too. Liverpool would also make sense if they don’t sign Alexander Isak.",
      "Leao’s performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act. Even after signing Madueke from Chelsea, we shouldn’t rule the Gunners out.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club — and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Liverpool’s ‘dream target’ if they miss out on Alexander Isak as Real Madrid star Rodrygo is embroiled in a potential transfer domino.",

      "The Magpies have had a difficult transfer window as Eddie Howe and his transfer team keep missing out on their top targets with Anthony Elanga and Aaron Ramsdale their main arrivals this summer.",
      "Amid interest from Liverpool in Alexander Isak, Newcastle had been targeting a move to sign Bundesliga striker Sesko but they have been beaten to the signing by Man Utd.",
      "Despite having a bid accepted by Leipzig, it became clear that Sesko favoured a move to Man Utd over Newcastle and now journalist Sacha Tavolieri has revealed that the Red Devils are looking to seal the transfer in the ‘next 48 hours’.",
      "Tavolieri wrote on X: ‘Manchester United are confident of completing the deal for Benjamin Sesko in the next 48 hours after United’s latest offer. They are closing in on a full agreement with RB Leipzig.’",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano added: ‘Manchester United and RB Leipzig, in direct talks again to adjust fee package and add-ons, trying to get it done ASAP. Follows Šeško’s decision to join #MUFC as revealed last night with personal terms agreed. Šeško will train separately until deal is done… ready to fly’.",
      "READ: Newcastle face ‘worst of all worlds’ Sesko outcome as ‘catastrophic ineptitude’ is exposed",
      "Before former CBS Sports reporter Ben Jacobs added his update: ‘Manchester United optimistic on reaching an agreement in principle with Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko. €75m+€10m offer meets Leipzig’s ballpark valuation, but structure of the deal is still being negotiated. €5m of the add-ons are easily achievable. Sesko is waiting for permission to travel after agreeing terms on a five-year contract.’",
      "And now GiveMeSport claim that Newcastle are ‘looking at completing deals for Yoane Wissa and Ollie Watkins’ in a double deal to make up for losing out on Sesko.",
      "The Magpies board ‘have now identified a duo they see as being able to strengthen their attack and save their transfer window, and are now plotting bringing them in’.",
      "Brentford have already rejected a £35m verbal offer from Newcastle for Wissa with the Bees reluctant to lose him and Mbeumo in the same window – but ‘there is confidence a deal can be done for around £40m before the September 1st deadline’.",
      "MORE NEWCASTLE COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Carragher reveals doubt on Isak as he ‘doesn’t want’ Liverpool to ‘spend £150m’ for one reason\n👉 Newcastle chose four Sesko alternatives after Man Utd make ‘improved offer’ for Leipzig star\n👉 Liverpool ‘transfer in limbo’ after Sesko news with Isak ‘to submit an official transfer request’",
      "Newcastle reckon Aston Villa’s Watkins – who was a target for Man Utd before they took the lead for Sesko – ‘could be the perfect partner for Wissa as Eddie Howe plots to use a front two more often’.",
      "GiveMeSport adds that the ‘Wissa-Watkins partnership was something the club were keen on doing before they made a move to sign Sesko’ with the Aston Villa striker set to cost in the region of £60m, taking a double deal to around the £100m mark.",
      "“This was the summer when Newcastle were supposed to strengthen and as we know now, they’ve gone for a number of players and just missed out on pretty much everyone they’ve gone for bar Aaron Ramsdale and Anthony Elanga.",
      "“The likes of João Pedro and Liam Dalap have gone to Chelsea. If Manchester United get Benjamin Sesko over the line, their front three next season, Bryan Mbuemo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha are three players that Newcastle liked and certainly tried and got far on with two of them in the shape of Sesko and Mbeumo.",
      "“By my last count there was eight players that Newcastle have just missed out on, so it’s been a bruising summer for them.",
      "“I think this one will be the hardest one of all, seeing Benjamin Sesko join Manchester United.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’.",

      "Meulensteen told Poker Strategy: “Manchester United’s bid for Benjamin Sesko is basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund. If he scores in the first three or four games and hits the ground running then he could be the answer for the club, but there’s a chance that won’t happen.",
      "“If you look at Hojlund, he joined Atalanta and performed well alongside the rest of the team and then joined United.  The same can be said for Sesko – the Bundesliga is a very different league to the Premier League, so he’ll need to adapt. Has Sesko got potential? 100%, but he’s still young and developing and he isn’t the finished article.”",

      "“Why doesn’t the club bring in Watkins and allow the coaches to work closely with Hojlund to allow him to develop? It’s a waste of an investment otherwise – they paid close to £80m for him and they’re in danger of selling him for less than half of that unless he develops.”",

      "Sesko is a top talent but also wanted by Newcastle. United may need to make sales before bidding, which doesn’t help. It may not be Sesko in the end, but signing a reliable striker is non-negotiable for Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Striker\nEddie Howe will need two strikers if Isak leaves. They’ve been targeting Wissa for a while and are now advancing in their pursuit of Sesko.",
      "Signing Sesko first would open the door for Isak to join Liverpool. Signing Wissa first opens…nothing. But their interest in Sesko remains unless Isak apologises and says he wants to stay.",
      "The original plan was Joao Pedro and Isak playing together. Chelsea signed Pedro, so the plan became Ekitike and Isak. That went awry so now the most realistic scenario is Wissa and Sesko leading the line, while Isak heads to Anfield.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Centre-midfielder\nJudging by the links, Forest want a central midfielder and we’re on board. Dan Ndoye has replaced Anthony Elanga, so that issue is sorted. Another winger could arrive, but improving Nuno Espirito Santo’s midfield depth is the priority.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Striker\nThe newly-promoted Black Cats have been busy, but they’re lacking quality up front. Chelsea’s Marc Guiu looks close to arriving on loan. That’s something, but not enough.",
      "RB Leipzig’s Lois Openda is reportedly under consideration, which would be one of the coups of the summer. It’s probably fantasy, but still.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Attacking midfielder\nAn attacking midfielder was already the priority — but now it’s urgent, with James Maddison picking up what looks like a serious injury. The poor guy has missed a lot of football already; an ACL tear is the last thing he needs.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was a top target even before Maddison’s setback. That deal was nearly done until Forest threatened legal action and Spurs backed off.",
      "Alternatives include Marc Casado, Hayden Hackney, Bilal El Khannouss, Lucas Paqueta, Kobbie Mainoo and Harvey Elliott.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Striker\nIt feels like West Ham need a striker every summer. Callum Wilson isn’t enough and Graham Potter surely knows that. They have plenty of options that feel like they could work. But they need to stop browsing and actually buy one.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Goalkeeper\nJose Sa was supposed to be replaced by Sam Johnstone, but has lived to fight another year. We’ll probably see a new goalkeeper arrive, with Johnstone now a target for Burnley.",
      "Wolves also need quality in attacking areas after losing Matheus Cunha, but replacing him won’t be easy. Keep it simple, lads: get a new No.1.",

      "Newcastle’s summer disaster\nI enjoyed Noj’s email as I love FM and can totally appreciate what they are saying about the owners at Newcastle, as a lot of my current ire is directed at them rather than solely focusing on PSR.",
      "Newcastle fans are very accustomed to board/owner level incompetence, but we genuinely thought we’d got past that when PIF came in. Staveley and her husband seemed to know what they wanted and could make it happen. Since she left we’re approaching comedy club status again. The CEO needs replacing because of illness, which isn’t anyone’s fault, but a serious business wouldn’t sit idle and just be in limbo like we are.",
      "The Sporting Director was a useless sh*te who seemingly did f*** all across all his time with the club, but left just at the most important time of the year with no replacement lined up, apparently having done nothing to prepare the ground for new transfers.",
      "The entire recruiting team needs an overhaul. So many of the players we’ve gone after never wanted to join. Players we’ve landed in the past we had little or no competition for – Botman, Isak, Bruno, Tonali all landed with minimal fuss, so what are we doing differently now than 3-4 years ago? Was Mitchell actually right in saying our recruitment set up was bad? If that were true, how has most of our business worked out so well but this summer it’s been so terrible? Lessons have to be learned.",
      "I completely get why other fans are fed up with hearing about how PSR is holding Newcastle back when there is so much catastrophic ineptitude on display for all to see. We have money to spend, what we appear to lack is any nous in identifying the players who want to join, and the skill to negotiate the right deal.",
      "The Sesko transfer – we’re haggling over a sell on clause according to reports. Why? We need him! We’re absolutely desperate and we’ve not even addressed the other gaping holes in the squad.",
      "The rewards of landing him are so bleeding obvious. All of a sudden from looking utterly f**ked we’ll have two very good strikers. At my most optimistic I believe there might be a  path back for Isak if Liverpool are not just posturing about walking away from a deal.",
      "But even if Isak gets sold if Sesko joins, which seems more likely, Newcastle will have money to spend on the other areas of the squad we’ve not even begun to address. Its win-win and could turn the summer around completely. No-one will care how many targets we missed at the start of the summer if by the end of it our squad is in better shape than at the end of May.",
      "Failure to get Sesko and we are in the worst of all worlds. Guedes from PSG is the next cab off the rank apparently – we’re down to wanting PSG’s third choice striker and supposed to be enthusiastic about this.",
      "This genuinely feels like a home-grown catastrophe, and there has to be accountability. We have to have a Sporting Director who works well with Eddie Howe and team. There has to be a better scouting and recruitment team who don’t waste time on deals with players who simply don’t want to be at Newcastle. And instead of this boom and bust cycle, there has to be a CEO with a strategy of mitigating the unassailable PSR gap over the 10-15 years it may take, with a decision on the new stadium or expanded St James’, new training ground and facilities, and huge investment in youth academies and recruitment.\nJames",

      "Regardless, unlike the movie, there’s no returning to Woody Harrelson/Newcastle. The trust is gone and the relationship is over. It is just a matter of time and to pretend otherwise is delusional. All Newcastle can do is collect the money. Unlike Woody, I assume they won’t be donating it to charity.",
      "All the talk of loyalty and betrayal is nonsense. It’s not a relationship that’s based on unconditional love, and football clubs (and fanbases) only want players to stay when it’s of benefit to them, and will cut a player loose as soon as it behoves them to do so (age, loss of form, injury, need the money). Why should more be expected for players?",
      "While it would have been nice to receive a fee for Trent, I couldn’t care less when he left, or how he left. The club is the thing and he’s no longer a Liverpool player. Same for Coutinho, Suarez, Torres, McManaman and Owen. I just remember the good times and move on.",
      "Obviously it’s not for me to tell Newcastle fans how to feel, but I’d be looking to get excited about how to spend the £135m and taking one step back in order to take two steps forward. Isak isn’t going to be your life partner (e.g. Shearer), just a hot ex.\nPeekay",

      "A word on Wissa\nI’ve noticed a bit of sympathy shown towards Wissa on this site so please allow me to give a Brentford fan’s perspective on this.",
      "First of all, almost all of the information being reported in the media is conjecture. Nobody involved has gone on the record and said anything of note (apart from some fairly bland comments from Keith Andrews). So we mostly don’t know what is true and what isn’t.",
      "This, it seems, doesn’t stop the media from reporting as if they are “facts”. But let’s be honest, most of the noise here is almost certainly coming from Wissa’s agent who’s trying to stir things up to engineer a move for his client and a massive payday for himself. Maybe, just maybe, there is some ulterior motive there that makes him an unreliable source.",
      "Was he ‘promised’ by Brentford that he could leave this Summer? Does anyone truly believe that?!? I’ve no doubt there may have been some conversations along the lines of “if we get a sensible bid we won’t stand in your way”, but that hardly amounts to a promise. And £25m hardly amounts to a sensible bid for a player who was only outscored by Salah last season for non-penalty goals.",
      "Of the facts we do “know”, Wissa left the Portugal training camp early and wasn’t in the squad for the friendly v QPR last weekend. He also appears to be training separately from the main squad (although even that isn’t certain). I’m struggling to see why there should be any sympathy for the player’s behaviour that has led to this situation? No player should be holding their employer to ransom like this. And I would argue that a player of Wissa’s talent has essentially hit his ceiling already anyway. He’s not being coveted by Newcastle to be their main striker. Maybe he wants the extra coin and champions league prestige, but I wouldn’t say it’s really stepping up to be a back-up centre forward for the 5th placed PL club compared to being the first choice at the 10th placed PL club. There’s only one way Wissa gets even close to matching the 19 goals he scored last season, and that’s staying with Brentford (and not being a d*ck about it).",
      "That’s all to say, I wouldn’t begrudge him the move if it’s what he wants. But it has to be on our terms, and it’s disappointing that some (maybe most) of the reporting seems to be with a slant towards Wissa and/or Newcastle’s perspective, with very little in support of little-old Brentford’s position.\nRob, Surrey, Bees fan",

      "Crystal Palace – one step back, two steps forward?\nI, along with I’m sure the majority of football fans, wish Crystal Palace well in their appeal against demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League. However, if the worst should happen and the decision not be overturned, they shouldn’t be too down, because I think the Conference League is a Cup they could actually have a damned good chance of winning.",
      "Sure, the Europa League is a higher standard and offers the dream of qualifying for the Champions League via the back door and Palace fans could argue with some credence that if a largely rotten Spurs team could win that then why not them, but it would be quite the long shot, whereas in the Conference League, they ought to be within the half dozen strongest contenders, particularly if they reached the latter stages with no realistic fears of relegation from the Premier League.",
      "Sure, it’d be something of a consolation prize, but I’m sure West Ham fans treasure the memories of their win two seasons back and Palace themselves had a similar experience in winning the FA Cup – their first ever major trophy. When you weigh that up against merely competing in the Europa League and likely being knocked out along the way, it might be a genuine decision which you’d rather go for…\nNick, Bristol",

But doesn’t that cascade down? 4-7th play to decide Champions League teams, then 6-9th for the other European places. At the other end, 15-19 playing for relegation places. Hypothetical: VAR chalk off an Arsenal goal v West Ham in September, they come second, but play a one-off v City for the League?",
      "Nobody genuinely thinks luck evens out. But nobody believes it’s possible to legislate for.\nBrian",
      "",
      "So let me get this straight. Ozzy, AFC’s answer to what he feels is the unfairness of a league playing as few as 38 games and not enough games, therefore, to even out that unfairness – so really needing multiple season’s worth of games to even things out – is to play a one-off decider? Seriously? As if there could be no issues with say, one team also playing a Champions League final at around this time or a major player with a serious injury for that one game, etc?",
      "North America doesn’t do cups the way football teams in Europe do. The ‘league’ is not a league just jostling for position to get into the cup-like playoffs. In the case of baseball with 162 ‘regular season’ games, they play enough to even out most issues – hence why data-oriented (aka Moneyball) stats work.(Teams can have massive dips in performance and still make the playoffs.) Meanwhile,  ice-hockey and basketball play 82 games, while (American football) only 17.   Yet even with such a massive difference in regular season games, they all still do ‘playoffs.’ At least in ice-hockey and basketball the playoff is a grind, with 4 rounds of best-of-seven series to get to the final and win. This playoff scenario is due to the huge geography of North America limiting teams to playing an even schedule between each other thus being separated into divisions where they will play more games against divisional opponents with a few road-trips thrown in. So they aren’t balancing ‘unevenness’ in the way Ozzy is thinking with playoffs. They’re balancing the unevenness of games against each other.",
      "The reality is that if just one player as in Rodri is the total reason a season was derailed then that is an issue that City’s management should have addressed. And the data shows that the new manager impact is in fact neutral.",
      "And we haven’t even got to the impact of specific referees, red cards, penalties being given or not given or poor VAR decisions (ala Liverpool vs Spurs or a whole season for Brighton.)",
      "Perhaps Ozzy would prefer we only hand out a Premier League title every 4 years – after all,  surely 152 games would be enough to even things out?\nPaul McDevitt",

While there are a number of the England team whose performances were immense, Chloe was arguably the stand-out character of the team.",

      "It had been widely reported that United would only submit a bid if Sesko had made it clear that Old Trafford was his preferred destination.",
      "Their offer is the strongest indication yet that Sesko wants to join Ruben Amorim’s side this summer — another crushing transfer blow for Newcastle.",
      "The Magpies have endured a miserable window so far, missing out on several top targets, including Joao Pedro and James Trafford, and now facing the prospect of losing star striker Alexander Isak, who has reportedly told the club he wants to join Liverpool.",
      "Despite their reluctance to sell Isak, Newcastle quickly turned to Sesko as a potential replacement for the Swede.",
      "The Leipzig striker’s signing would open the door for Isak to move to Anfield, with Newcastle unwilling to sell without a replacement lined up, unless Liverpool come in with an irresistible offer.",
      "At first, their pursuit of Sesko looked promising. But United’s intervention has complicated matters, and they now appear to have convinced the 22-year-old to pick Old Trafford over St James’ Park.",
      "Fabrizio Romano provided a key update on Tuesday night, revealing that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team are growing increasingly confident.",

      "“Man United forwarded official contract proposal to Sesko while also keep negotiating with RB Leipzig.”",
      "Sesko scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga games last season, drawing inevitable comparisons to big-money flop Rasmus Hojlund — thanks to a similar age profile, goal record, and lack of Premier League experience.",
      "United signed Hojlund from Atalanta for a total fee of €80million in the summer of 2023 after he scored nine goals in 32 Serie A appearances in the previous campaign.",
      "It’s certainly an interesting approach from the club’s hierarchy, who appear to favour 22-year-old Sesko over Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, who is open to the move, has 75 goals in 184 Premier League games, and is reliably available, missing just six top-flight matches across five seasons.",

      "Newcastle and Manchester United have both made bids for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 17:47, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle and Manchester United have both lodged bids in the region of £70m.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Newcastle's new offer is £69.7m as a fixed fee plus add-ons;  Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 13:39, UK",
      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "It is understood Newcastle are now offering £69.7m (€80m) as a fixed fee plus add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "They have since been negotiating with Leipzig and have now raised their offer.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko.",
      "United have not made an official bid and are aware of Newcastle's latest offer, but they intend to remain disciplined and will not get drawn into a bidding war",
      "Sesko is believed to be open to both projects, although one source has claimed he has been leaning towards United, if they can agree a deal with Leipzig.",
      "It is thought United would want a clear indication Sesko only wants to join them before making a formal bid.",
      "While United's focus has been on Sesko, he is not the only striker United are looking at.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for several strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Man Utd's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit by Isak's desire to leave but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, although the Brentford striker wants to join the Magpies.",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their alternative to Alexander Isak at No 9.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best, so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\"",

      "Match report as Man Utd wrap up a Premier League Summer Series win with a 2-2 draw against Everton; Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty and Mason Mount was also on target; Iliman Ndiaye scored for Everton before an Ayden Heaven own goal",
      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",

      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",

      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
