      "Jadon Sancho was afforded a rare chance in Unai Emery's Aston Villa starting lineup against Maccabi Tel Aviv. The Manchester United loanee only served to leave former Villa captain Stilian Petrov disappointed in his side's 2-0 win.",
      "Sancho made just his third start of the season on Thursday night as he came into the side with Donyell Malen and Evann Guessand as Ollie Watkins dropped out. Goals from former Chelsea ace Ian Maatsen and Malen either side of half-time, secured victory for Emery's men, to take them sixth in the league phase of their European competition.",
      "Former Borussia Dortmund star Sancho lasted 75 minutes before being replaced by Youri Tielemans and he was just one of two players who did not impress Petrov. The ex-Celtic midfielder believes Sancho had an opportunity but failed to take advantage.",
      "\"I'm not sure if I can say that for Sancho and Guessand. I'm a bit disappointed there.\"",
      "Sancho's performance comes in the aftermath of being substituted on and off the pitch against Manchester City in the Premier League last month. The winger faced the ignominy of entering the field in the 29th minute and being replaced by Evann Guessand after 74 against Pep Guardiola's men.",
      "“I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now, he’s not ready to play 90 minutes,\" said Emery, explaining his decisions. \"45 minutes is not easy enough for him, and I am happy and, of course, progressively, he’s getting better and better.”",
      "With Sancho set to return from Old Trafford following his loan, it appears United chiefs have already made up their minds, however. The club are ready to let him leave for nothing next summer despite stumping up £73million five years ago.",
      "The Red Devils have the option to trigger a 12-month extension as Sancho's deal runs out in the summer. But United do not want to risk paying his £200,000-a-week wages if they fail to find a buyer, it is said.",
      "In the summer, Amorim claimed that the likes of Sancho would not be sold cheaply just to see them depart. They now appear ready to cut their losses.",
      "He said: \"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.\"",

      "Liverpool will hope that their win over Real Madrid is a sign that the Reds are beginning to get back on track. Arne Slot's side ended their run of league defeats against Aston Villa at the weekend and followed it up with a statement win over Real Madrid in the Champions League.",
      "The Reds appear to be turning a corner after a dreadful run of form and will have been relieved to see Mohamed Salah score in back-to-back league games. However, Liverpool could potentially be forced to deal without their talisman in the coming weeks as a possible dispute emerges.",
      "Slot will be focused on ensuring Liverpool extend their win streak in a crucial game away at Manchester City on Sunday. Meanwhile, figures behind the scenes will be helping to formulate the club’s transfer plans.",
      "Mohamed Salah is reportedly set for key talks with Egypt boss Hossam Hassan during the upcoming international break later this month. The Liverpool forward could find himself caught up in another club vs country row, as Egypt are scheduled to hold a training camp ahead of games against the United Arab Emirates (December 6), Jordan (December 9) and Nigeria (December 14) in preparation for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "In the same timeframe, Liverpool are set to face Leeds away, followed by Inter Milan in the Champions League and a home game against Brighton. The Daily Mail reports that Salah would prefer to play for the Reds before joining the Egypt squad at a later date, ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "A similar situation arose two years ago and Liverpool were able to keep hold of Salah. However, the 33-year-old will want to avoid any upset as Egypt and Liverpool need to agree on when he will be released for AFCON.",
      "The tournament is being held in Morocco from December 21 to January 18. If it is agreed that he can join up with the squad after the Brighton game, Salah could realistically miss up to eight Liverpool matches in all competitions, should Egypt reach the final.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly in competition with Manchester United for Hertha Berlin starlet Kennet Eichhorn. The 16-year-old defensive midfielder is enjoying the start of his breakout season, making six starts in the German second tier.",
      "German publication Bild has reported that Hertha have placed a £17million asking price on the teenager, who signed a new deal in the summer. However, Liverpool face plenty of competition for the youngster’s signature, including from United.",
      "It is claimed that scouts from Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG and many other clubs have been keeping tabs on Eichhorn. Despite his tender age, Eichhorn, who has been likened to Toni Kroos, is more than holding his own in Hertha’s midfield.",
      "\"He is an incredible, exceptional talent,\" Hertha’s Fabian Reese said Eichhorn’s debut. \"If he continues like this, all doors will be open to him. I have rarely seen anyone so talented at that age. He has a huge career ahead of him.\"",
      "Manager Stefan Leitl added: \"I couldn't care less whether he's 16 or 17. He's a huge talent for Hertha. In many of his actions, you could see what we might be seeing from him in the coming years. I'm completely convinced of his abilities; he did a great job.\"",

      "Manchester United are on their best run of form in recent times and are aiming to take three points from Tottenham on Saturday. The Red Devils will travel to London for the early kick-off at 12:30pm after a week's training at Carrington.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been on an upward trajectory recently, with three wins and one draw in their last four games. The most notable victory came at Anfield against Liverpool, where Harry Maguire scored the winner to beat their rivals 2-1.",
      "The Glazers, who are the majority stakeholders at United, could be convinced to sell their shares in the club if 'the price is right'. The American business family has faced intense criticism from fans regarding the management of the Premier League side in recent times.",
      "Earlier this season, speculation about a potential takeover from a new investor emerged but has since been squashed by United officials. However, The Times reports that if the money was what the Glazers deemed worthwhile, then they could be persuaded to sell their stake in the club.",
      "The report reads: \"I think for the right price, [the Glazers] definitely would [sell]. There is a clause within Ratcliffe's agreement when he bought the club - I think it was triggered in August this year - that meant if the right offer came in - and I think that it was over something like $33 a share - that the Glazers could sell the whole club.",
      "\"Not just their portion of it, but Sir Ratcliffe will be bought out, as well, so there is potential that the Glazers could sell the entire club but, at the minute, it just seems like a strange one with this news, this hype and this excitement that's been triggered by this one tweet.\"",
      "The Glazers last addressed their takeover stance publicly in April when youngest sibling Edward said: \"I think that... We're a family business, and it was really a decision we made collectively.",
      "\"Not every decision is six-nothing. But, ultimately, why we have been successful as a family business is that we've always kind of agreed that, if the majority of family members want to do something, we realise we are in a family business and we have to do it.",
      "\"One day it might be something that I'm in favour of. The next day, it may be something I'm not in favour. It was a family decision [the minority takeover].\"",
      "Sir David Beckham celebrated receiving a knighthood from King Charles by dining at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Chelsea. The former United star was handed the accolade for his services to sport and charity earlier this week and was spotted enjoying a meal at the Michelin-starred eatery.",
      "The Sun reports that Beckham was joined at the dinner table by wife Victoria and his family, which included sons Cruz and Romeo, daughter Harper and his parents, Ted and Sandra. Close friend and restaurant owner Ramsay was also in attendance alongside his wife Tana, as well as Beckham's friend Dave Gardner and his wife Jessica Clarke.",
      "The Beckhams' oldest son, Brooklyn, wasn't spotted at the celebratory dinner, as tensions continue within the family. The 26-year-old is yet to publicly congratulate his father on the honour, as Sir David shared his joy at receiving such an important accolade.",
      "Speaking after the ceremony, the 50-year-old said: \"I couldn't be prouder. People know how patriotic I am - I love my country. I've always said how important the monarchy is to my family. I'm lucky enough to have travelled around the world and all people want to talk to me about is our monarchy. It makes me proud.\"",

      "Enzo Maresca claimed Manchester United were a better side AFTER Erik ten Hag was sacked amid reports that he is edging towards a managerial return. The Dutchman left Old Trafford in October 2024 following a dire start to the campaign.",
      "Ten Hag returned to football this summer as he took the reins from Xabi Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen. But he lasted just three games with the Bundesliga side as they opted to make a surprisingly swift change in the dugout.",
      "Ten Hag could yet find a role over the next few days having been linked with a move to Wolves - albeit they have now made an approach for Middlesbrough boss Rob Edwards. Nevertheless, Ajax are also reportedly mulling over a move for their former boss after sacking John Heitinga.",
      "Regardless, his former Premier League rival Enzo Maresca made his feelings on Ten Hag clear and previously claimed that the Red Devils would potentially have been a tougher opponent after the Dutchman was jettisoned.",
      "Speaking ahead of a meeting between United and Chelsea shortly after Ten Hag's exit, he said: “Yes, for sure,” before adding: “When you change manager, always for the first one, two, three games, you can see the reaction from the players,” he added. “So, probably it will be [tougher]. But in any case it will be a tough game.”",
      "Ten Hag has remained silent over a switch back to the dugout, albeit did release a statement following his exit from Leverkusen. He said: \"The decision by Bayer Leverkusen this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a manager after just two league matches is unprecedented.",

      "The Red Devils chose to sell the winger in the summer, banking £40million when he left Manchester and headed to Chelsea. He'd been in and out of Ruben Amorim's starting XI whilst his attitude had also been cited as an issue at Old Trafford.",
      "He's since begun his new chapter in west London, where competition is particularly high in the final third. He's by no means a guaranteed starter under Enzo Maresca and has scored just once in his first five Premier League outings.",
      "However, Garnacho was on song on Wednesday night when he appeared from the bench to rescue Chelsea against Qarabag in the Champions League. The Argentine scored their equaliser and Sidwell admitted he can be sensational when at the top of his game.",
      "Garnacho had been tipped to be a long-term star in Manchester when he burst onto the scene under Erik ten Hag. He scored some major goals, including one in the FA Cup final in 2024, but was unable to deliver consistently and was eventually allowed to depart.",
      "Since the summer transfer window shut United have already seen some their talent excel elsewhere. Rasmus Hojlund was regarded as a flop but has been in the goals ever since moving to Napoli. He's continued the trend of players who find form once leaving Manchester.",
      "Chelsea are not lacking for quality in the final third with Garnacho going up against the likes of Estevao and Pedro Neto for a starting berth. But Garnacho knows the value of coming off the bench and was happy to make an impact when called upon in Azerbaijan but his coach.",
      "He said: \"He (Maresca) wanted me to help the team, come on and play my part. I scored to equalise, but it’s not enough. We needed to score another. It was a good finish, and I just tried to help the team with a goal or an assist, or even just hard work, but I wanted to win the game. As a winger, you have to deliver with a goal or an assist, and it’s the way you can help the team, and that’s what I’m trying to do.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has reportedly held talks over a return to former club Ajax. Ten Hag is available after being sacked by Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the season and has recently been linked with a return to the Premier League.",
      "The Dutchman was among the names shortlisted by Wolves as they continue the search for a replacement for the sacked Vitor Pereira. Ten Hag is looking for a new club having been sacked by Leverkusen just two Bundesliga games into the season.",
      "Dutch outlet AD says that Ten Hag has already held talks with Ajax chiefs over the possibility of succeeding John Heitinga as boss, who was sacked on Thursday. Ajax are fourth in the Eredivisie and were thrashed 3-0 at home by Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday night in what proved to be the final straw for Heitinga.",
      "Heitinga left his role on Arne Slot’s coaching staff at Liverpool to take over at Ajax in the summer, but won just five of his 15 games in charge. The 41-year-old was dismissed in a statement on Thursday afternoon. Technical director Alex Kroes said: \"It's a painful decision. But looking back at the past few months, we must conclude that things have turned out quite differently from what we had envisioned. We’ve seen too little progress and have unnecessarily dropped points.\"",
      "The loss against Galatasaray made it one win in the last seven games for Heitinga, who saw supporters call for his sacking post-match. One supporter group released a statement on Wednesday which read: “This is no longer sustainable. The decline in the sport must be halted now. The AFCA Supporters Club has enormous respect for Heitinga as a player. But now we are judging him as a coach.”",
      "Ajax’s players have also painted a worrying picture, with Davy Klaasen failing to back Heitinga while saying there was “little foundation” and “little development” post-match. It now seems as though Ten Hag could be the man to fill the void after Fred Grim was appointed as interim boss.",
      "Kroes has reportedly met with Ten Hag this week and his previous success with the club could land him a return. The 55-year-old coach won 73 per cent of his games between January 2018 and May 2022, winning three Eredivisie titles and two domestic cups while also getting Ajax to the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "His eye-catching work at Ajax earned him the move to United in the summer of 2022 and he delivered two more trophies at Old Trafford: the Carabao Cup in 2023 and FA Cup in 2024.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked by United a year ago, with Ruben Amorim coming in to replace him, and while his short stay at Leverkusen was a blow, it doesn’t seem to have damaged his reputation much.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that Cristiano Ronaldo was right to highlight the \"lot of mistakes\" Manchester United made in the past. The United manager was responding to the club's former star forward after he took aim at his ex-employers in an interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "Ronaldo said Amorim was fighting an uphill battle to turn things around at United due to the structures in place around him. But while agreeing that mistakes had been made, Amorim unsurprisingly painted a much more positive picture of the club today.",
      "\"Of course, he knows he has huge impact on everything he says,\" he said in a press conference ahead of United's game against Tottenham on Saturday. \"But what we need to focus on is in future. We know as a club we made a lot of mistakes in the past. We are trying to change that.",
      "\"Let’s not focus on what happened. We need to focus on the future. Let’s focus on the way we are doing things. We are changing a lot of things, the structure, the way we want the players to behave, we are improving. Let’s forget a little bit the past.\"",
      "Ronaldo left United under a cloud in December 2022 for Saudi Arabia after a major falling out during his second spell with the club. He has sniped at the club on a few occasions since - and repeated his scathing view of them this week.",
      "“For me, I'm sad because of the club, that’s one of the most important clubs in the world, and a club that I still have in my heart because of the obvious reasons,\" he told Morgan.",
      "He added: “You have to follow with the intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United have [done] so many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary, Roy Keane, Beckham, they became big players but they had youth. So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure.",
      "“I hope that changes in the future, present/future, because the potential of the club, it's amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Asked for his views on Amorim, Ronaldo said: “He’s doing his best. What are you going to do? Miracles. Miracles is impossible. We say in Portugal, ‘Miracles is only in Fatima’... And he’s not gonna do miracles. They have good players, but they don’t have, some of them, in mind what Manchester United is.”",

United academy product Marcus Rashford, currently on loan with the Spanish heavyweights, is tipped to make his move to the Nou Camp permanent after some stellar performances since his transfer to Spain earlier this season.",
      "Barcelona's German head coach is a huge admirer of the England ace, who has netted an impressive six goals and provided seven assists in 15 matches across all competitions this season. The 28-year-old appears to be rediscovering his top form after falling out of favour under United manager Ruben Amorim, having spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Earlier this week, Spanish outlet ABC claimed that Flick had told his coaching staff he plans to step down from Barcelona due to reportedly growing 'tired' of the atmosphere among the players, pointing to issues in the dressing room.",
      "However, Sky Germany have dismissed these claims, which will come as a significant boost for Rashford and his aspirations of sealing a permanent switch to Barcelona.",
      "The recent report insists Flick is thoroughly content at the Catalan club and is contracted until the summer of 2027, highlighting his ambitious plans for the club's future.",
      "Earlier this season, Rashford opened up about the impact Flick has had on his game during a chat with TNT Sport, saying: \"He's very important. I feel the confidence he's given me.",
      "\"I knew he was a top manager before I arrived here, but to work with him is a pleasure. I hope the good relationship will continue for the rest of the season.\"",
      "Flick's admiration for Rashford is evident, as he showered praise on the striker after United's 3-1 victory over Elche in La Liga.",
      "\"One or two more goals would have been good for him,\" he said. \"I'm happy with him; I know he can play at this level and he's shown it. He's an important player.\"",
      "Rashford wasn't quite able to continue his impressive form for Barca in their recent 3-3 draw with Belgian side Club Brugge in the Champions League.",
      "So far this season, the England international has four goals and two assists in Europe's elite competition, but drew a blank in Belgium on Wednesday night.",
      "Barcelona have an option to sign Rashford at the end of the season and make the England international's move to Catalonia permanent, with United setting out their stance by including the clause in the deal.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's firm, Ineos, has reportedly agreed to cough up over £11million to swiftly settle a lawsuit with Tottenham Hotspur. The company, owned by the Manchester United co-owner, was accused of breaching a five-year minimum contract worth £17.5m that allowed Tottenham to promote the firm's Grenadier as the club's \"official 4X4 vehicle partner.\"",
      "The deal was thought to have been inked in 2022, but Ineos had been partnered with Spurs since they were dubbed the club's \"official hand-sanitiser supplier\" during the Covid-19 outbreak. Tottenham called time on their deal with Ratcliffe's company in March and initiated legal proceedings three months later.",
      "They claim an annual instalment exceeding £5m was not paid on December 1, having already allegedly missed an inflation-related payment of around £500,000.",
      "According to the Telegraph, the total sum paid to Spurs remains under wraps, but a source close to the matter suggested the agreed amount was about half what the north Londoners were seeking. Furthermore Spurs were after nearly £5.3m in damages when the deal was terminated with more than two years left on the clock. Shortly thereafter, Ineos hit back by counter-suing Spurs for over £1m.",
      "They pointed the finger at the north Londoners for engaging in sponsorship talks with Audi, which were tied to Harry Kane's potential transfer to Bayern Munich. Ineos stated: \"On or around 3 August 2023 (i.e. early in contract year two), Todd Kline of the club indicated to Ashley Reed of Ineos that the club had been in discussions with the German car manufacturer Audi AG in connection with rights which were the same as, or substantially similar to, the rights granted to Ineos under the agreement and/or the club had been negotiating with Audi in respect of rights which were exclusive to Ineos under clause 4 of the agreement.",
      "\"According to Mr Kline, the discussions and/or negotiations related to a proposed transfer of the club's player Harry Kane to the German club FC Bayern Munich.\"",
      "Ineos' defence also claimed the commercial partnership had \"not materialised\" before stating \"this sequence of events ultimately resulted in the parties agreeing that Ineos could terminate the agreement with effect from the end of year three of the contract term”",
      "They firmly stated: \"In the circumstances, it is the club which owes Ineos more than £1m for failing to provide any rights to Ineos in the final part of year three.\"",
      "Spurs acknowledged holding commercial discussions with Audi, but rejected suggestions these talks gave Ineos the right to terminate their agreement, given that Tottenham never finalised a deal with the German car manufacturer. Tottenham maintain the arrangement with Ineos \"involved annual payments starting at £2.125m in year one and increasing to £4.6m in year five, all plus VAT and index-linked to the rate of inflation\" and that they would be pursuing interest \"further or other relief as the court thinks fit\".",
      "At the time, an Ineos spokesperson said: \"Ineos Automotive was a partner of Tottenham Hotspur from 2022, expanding on a partnership agreement that Ineos Group had in place with the club since 2020. We had a contractual right to terminate our partnership contract and in December 2024 exercised that right.\"",
      "Ineos have severed links with numerous major sports teams they had been backing. They have already ended partnerships with Ben Ainslie's sailing squad and the New Zealand All Blacks rugby union side.",
      "In February, the Telegraph also reported the latter were launching legal action, claiming their agreement, which was expected to run until 2027, was terminated prematurely, despite a contract being in place.",
      "Ineos have argued they have been compelled into cost-cutting due to \"extreme\" green carbon taxes in Europe. Ratcliffe has pointed the finger at escalating energy prices and taxes as the reasoning behind the firm's decision to shut down their synthetic ethanol plant in Grangemouth, Scotland. This move resulted in the loss of 80 direct roles and an additional 500 indirect jobs.",

      "Liverpool and Manchester United are keeping tabs on German wonderkid Kennet Eichhorn, who Hertha Berlin are willing to let go for £17million. Eichhorn, 16, is making waves in Berlin after breaking into Hertha's first-team this season.",
      "The defensive midfielder has made eight appearances in the German second tier, forcing some of Europe's biggest clubs to take notice. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen have all reportedly sent scouts to watch Eichhorn.",
      "Premier League delegates are also regulars at the Olympiastadion. It's claimed that Liverpool, United, Arsenal and Manchester City have all began scouting him.",
      "German publication Bild, via Mundo Deportivo, report that Hertha have already told interested parties that they'd consider an offer worth €20m (£17m). Eichhorn got his chance in the first-team because of injuries but he's managed to keep his place thanks to a string of impressive performances.",
      "\"He is an incredible, exceptional talent,\" team-mate Fabian Reese hailed following the 16-year-old's debut. \"If he continues like this, all doors will be open to him. I have rarely seen anyone so talented at that age. He has a huge career ahead of him.\"",
      "Boss Stefan Leitl has also waxed lyrical after the match, saying: \"I couldn't care less whether he's 16 or 17. He's a huge talent for Hertha. In many of his actions, you could see what we might be seeing from him in the coming years. I'm completely convinced of his abilities; he did a great job.\"",
      "Eichhorn signed a new contract in July and has earned comparisons to ex-Germany star Toni Kroos because of his ability to control the tempo of a game. Kroos' brother, Felix, has urged him to stay at Hertha for two to four more years and help them return to the Bundesliga.",
      "Speaking to RTL, Kroos explained: \"That's the beauty of football: there isn't one right path, no magic formula. Still, Eichhorn, at 16, is a special case and should remain in his familiar environment.",
      "Who should Kennet Eichhorn sign for - Liverpool or Manchester United? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "\"That's what brought him to where he is now. A move to Bayern or [Borussia] Dortmund in the next two to four years would be too early. I hope he develops at Hertha for a few more years. Ultimately, you can't plan anything in football.",
      "\"If it goes well and Eichhorn stays another two or three years, those six million (euros) could become 60 million. That would be even better for the books in Berlin. And with the sums circulating today, six million is too little anyway.\"",
      "He added: \"The way Eichhorn plays is remarkable. He radiates calm, gains valuable experience, and is allowed to make mistakes. He has the quality, yet he will sometimes sit out. You have to give such a young player a break because it's a lot for the mind.\"",

Names like Xabi Alonso remained on the shortlist for the job but after the now-Real Madrid boss turned down the offer, other potential candidates began cropping up.",

Pearce writes: \"After Alonso publicly ruled himself out of contention, the name most persistently linked with Liverpool in the media was Sporting Lisbon coach Amorim, who was about to clinch his second Primeira Liga title with the Portuguese giants.\"",
      "However, while the Reds admired Amorim's success in Portugal, they were concerned about how he set up his team and his style of play, which was not deemed as a good fit for the Liverpool squad. Pearce continues: \"Amorim was a serious contender and boasted the best record in terms of player availability. However, that was partly attributed to him working in a less intense league.",
      "\"There was plenty to admire but Edwards and Hughes had doubts whether his preference for a three-man defence would suit the squad he would be inheriting at Anfield. There were also concerns that his slower, less dynamic style of play might fail to energise supporters.",
      "\"Hughes held talks with Amorim in Lisbon but the Sporting boss was subsequently informed that Liverpool were going in a different direction.\"",
      "Liverpool ended up opting for Slot, who had won the Eredivisie with Feyenoord and finished runner-up in the UEFA Conference League in the 2021/22 season. Pearce adds: \"Slot was always the preferred candidate.",
      "\"They loved how his football connected with the emotional fanbase at Feyenoord, they felt it wasn't too much of a change from Klopp's approach and they knew he was well versed in working in a sporting director model.\"",
      "While Amorim has seemingly finally settled at United, Liverpool's decision to select Slot seems to be the best move for both club and manager. The Dutchman won the Premier League in his first year in charge and revitalised a Liverpool squad that had only claimed the League Cup in Klopp's final campaign.",
      "Slot spent a whopping £446million over the summer and secured some star signings like Florian Wirtz, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. While there has been a dip in form in recent weeks, the Reds looked to be back to their best on Tuesday with a 1-0 win over familiar foes Real Madrid.",

      "An explosive summer transfer window for Manchester United continues to produce fallout this season. And not just at Old Trafford, either, following fresh word from Stamford Bridge concerning Alejandro Garnacho's development.",
      "The Argentina international left Ruben Amorim's squad under a cloud of controversy and joined Chelsea in a £40million move. The reduced fee was representative of United's ambition to offload the player, who appears to have turned a new leaf.",
      "Garnacho's profile at Old Trafford was dented considerably following Amorim's arrival at the club. There were never any real concerns regarding the winger's on-field ability, but his position became untenable largely due to doubts over his character.",
      "The South American was implicated in a scandal around this time last year, having been accused of leaking team news. He later branded United's 2024/25 season as \"s***\" and alluded to a potential summer exit after he was dropped for the Europa League final defeat to Spurs.",
      "Garnacho's brother, Roberto, also poured fuel on the fire with comments he made criticising the manager's decisions on social media. In the end, the player was deemed too troublesome and completed the move to west London after five years in Manchester.",
      "But any signs of rebelliousness appear to have dissipated in the capital. That's after Give Me Sport reported Chelsea staff have been impressed by the attacker's \"attitude and intensity\" in training, even staying late to work on his product in the final third.",
      "His place in Enzo Maresca's plans is far from absolute, however. Garnacho has one direct goal involvement in eight outings for the Blues and has had to settle for a place on the bench in Chelsea's last six Premier League outings.",
      "Whether it's down to the environment, his new coach or other factors, reports suggest he has changed for the better nonetheless. However, those at United may still wonder whether it's merely a matter of time before Garnacho's frustrations bubble to the surface once more in time.",
      "Amid a surge of attacking recruitment over the summer, there was plenty for United fans to get excited about ahead of this season. And 1999 Treble-winner Teddy Sheringham has been blown away by the impact made by Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Brazilian arrived alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in a complete renovation of the forward line. And Sheringham, who scored in the iconic comeback win over Bayern Munich more than 25 years ago, is expecting big things from the former Wolves talisman.",
      "\"He seemed like he’s found his place in the team – I don’t know whether someone has spoken to him about stepping up to the plate and taking on that mantle of being the focal point of the team, but he’s definitely taken that on in the last month.",
      "\"He could be the difference between United being an average team and a very good team. Long may his form continue.\"",
      "Cunha scored his first United goal in last month's impressive 4-2 victory over Brighton. However, fans will be desperate to see the versatile forward improve his returns even further as the Red Devils climb the rungs in the Premier League ladder.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Edward Glazer, one of the five siblings who hold a controlling stake in Manchester United, has shed light on how the US family reaches consensus on key decisions concerning the football club. Despite enduring harsh criticism from fans over the millions of dollars of debt accrued since their takeover in 2005, the Glazer family has maintained a majority stake in the club.",
      "In 2024, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe finalised a deal to purchase a 27.7 per cent stake in the club - valued at approximately $1.6billion (£1.25bn). As part of the agreement, Ratcliffe has assumed control of football operations, assisted by Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada.",
      "Earlier this season, speculation about a potential takeover was rife when Turki Al-Sheikh posted on social media that the Reds were in 'advanced negotiations with a new investor'. On X, Al-Sheikh wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "He followed this up with: \"My (yesterday's) post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing, the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.\"",
      "\"Just to clarify, I'm not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "At the time, United officials were taken aback by Al-Sheikh's activity, claiming that the report were 'news to them'. The Times' Charlotte Duncker did explain, though, how Ratcliffe could be left with no option if the Glazers decided to sell the club.",
      "\"I think for the right price, they definitely would. There is a clause within Ratcliffe's agreement when he bought the club - I think it was triggered in August this year - that meant if the right offer came in - and I think that it was over something like $33 a share - that the Glazers could sell the whole club.",
      "\"Not just their portion of it, but Sir Ratcliffe will be bought out, as well, so there is potential that the Glazers could sell the entire club but, at the minute, it just seems like a strange one with this news, this hype and this excitement that's been triggered by this one tweet.\"",
      "Speculation continues to swirl around a potential takeover at Old Trafford, although no formal discussions have taken place. Back in April, Edward Glazer - the youngest of the Glazer siblings - was quizzed about their decision-making process within the football club.",
      "When asked about the rationale behind their decision to sell around a quarter of United to Ratcliffe during a talk with students at the Kogod School of Business in Washington, he explained: \"I think that... We're a family business, and it was really a decision we made collectively.",
      "\"Not every decision is six-nothing. But, ultimately, why we have been successful as a family business is that we've always kind of agreed that, if the majority of family members want to do something, we realise we are in a family business and we have to do it.",
      "\"One day it might be something that I'm in favour of. The next day, it may be something I'm not in favour. It was a family decision [the minority takeover].\"",

      "Manchester United's young prospect, Kai Rooney, has handed fans an encouraging injury update on social media - following a heart-wrenching revelation earlier this year. The eldest son of United great Wayne Rooney, Kai is keen to emulate his father's illustrious career in pro football.",
      "He suffered an injury setback earlier this season after impressing for United's youth teams, previously stating: \"Life couldn't get any worse.\" However, the 16-year-old, who celebrated his birthday earlier this month, has now shared what is a much more promising update that will please United supporters.",
      "Sporting his United training kit, Kai took to Instagram and posted two hour-glass emojis, suggesting his return to the pitch might be imminent. Previously, the youngster kept his followers informed about his recovery process by sharing pictures from Dubai, where he was seen without a protective boot on his foot.",
      "Kai turned heads at the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland this summer, a tournament where his father also made waves as an up-and-coming talent at Everton. The young Red Devil was making significant strides through the club's youth system, earning a call-up to United's Under-19s squad. Remarkably, he competed against professionals four years his senior when he was just 15.",
      "Before his senior call-up, he netted a stunning goal for the Under-18s, a left-footed volley that found its way into the top corner, echoing some of his father's most memorable strikes. Despite battling injury in recent weeks, Kai took a moment to back United academy product Marcus Rashford after the England star scored against Elche in a 3-1 La Liga victory.",
      "The young striker shared a snap of Rashford celebrating his goal on his own social media platforms.",
      "Even before the injury, Rooney Snr, now 40, sought to keep Kai level-headed and not get his hopes up. Speaking with Gary Neville, he said: \"[He has] my physique, but he'll be taller than me and he's a goal-scorer, he's in the box, he sniffs chances out and that's his game, so he's doing okay.\"",
      "Fellow United legend Neville then asked: \"Obviously you can't remember yourself, but is he at that sort of level where you think he's got a chance, or is it too early?\"",
      "Rooney replied: \"I think that it's too early, you never know. I think that he's showing potential and good signs. So, obviously, he'll be at United now for the next two years, and that's when they make decisions on you, so just wait and see really.\"",

      "The striker had been on United's radar for a number of years, with Wilcox and his fellow bigwigs fighting off strong competition from Newcastle to land Sesko's signature. But the Slovenian is yet to justify his price tag, albeit after just 11 games. Former captain Gary Neville recently described him as looking 'awkward' and 'miles off it', with Sesko having only scored two goals for the Red Devils.",
      "But Wilcox, who was promoted to the role of director of football in June, predicts that the ex-Red Bull Salzburg star will come good. Speaking to club media, Wilcox proclaimed: \"Benji, at the top end, he's going to be an amazing player.",
      "\"It's difficult to be the no.9 at United and I know sometimes that Matheus and Bryan are getting a lot of credit, but the runs that Benji is making is also helping Matheus [Cunha] and Bryan [Mbeumo] as well. All four of them have done really well, the summer signings from last year, they are top professionals.\"",
      "Wilcox's comments come after Neville gave a scathing assessment of Sesko's performances, admitting that 'the jury's still out. \"He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in, like Cunha and Mbeumo,\" Neville told NBC Sports.",
      "\"He looks awkward, his touch was off a few times when balls went over the top. For £80m [sic], yes he's young and still settling but you want to see something more.\"",
      "However, England legend Gary Lineker is more positive about the 22-year-old, describing him as 'promising'. \"One thing I would say is that their recruitment for the first time in some time looks pretty good,\" Lineker said on the Rest Is Football.",
      "Will Benjamin Sesko be successful at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"Cunha looks a really good player and Mbeumo looks a really good player. Sesko I think might show something, I think he is promising, so I think it has been better recruitment, but time will tell on that as well.\"",
      "Sesko hopes to prove his doubters wrong and score his third goal for United when Ruben Amorim's side face Tottenham on Saturday in London. The Slovenia international will then be aiming to help his country qualify for the World Cup, as they host Kosovo and travel to Sweden later this month.",

Amorim was asked about Martinez ahead of facing Nottingham Forest and said: \"He wants to go to this one, he isn't going to this one.

      "Manchester United's director of football Jason Wilcox expressed it best himself this week when discussing the club's transfer strategy.",
      "\"Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost. Are they attainable? With Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach,\" he told MUTV's Inside Carrington podcast.",
      "In truth, this is exactly what any self-respecting Premier League club should be doing. If United are going to be sustained challengers in the top four, they need to be planning all-year round.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Wilcox did not say which position they are looking to strengthen next in the market. But it doesn't take a genius to know that the central defensive midfield slot will be the next to be looked at.",
      "Casemiro is out of contract at the end of the season and while United hold an option to extend that deal by a further year, the Reds would want the Brazilian to extend on lower terms. This will, of course, require fresh negotiations and the 33-year-old is under no obligations to agree to them.",
      "Therefore, when he does leave which could be 2026 or 2027, United will need to sign a replacement. When they do that, Wilcox has dropped a huge hint as to where they will be looking.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn’t take too much risk in this area and we needed players we could plug in and play with little transition time,\" he explained. \"Senne we were always looking at goalkeepers who have huge potential and Senne was available so we decided to move. It wasn’t a knee-jerk reaction.\"",
      "Like bolstering the attack, the search for a new defensive midfielder looks like it will be focused on players who can slot in seamlessly - especially those who are currently in the Premier League. There is a catch to this plan, though.",
      "Firstly, signing a player from a Premier League club comes at a premium. You only have to look back at the deal for Mbeumo to see that the negotiations can be long and difficult with division rivals.",
      "Then, once that deal is finally complete, you can end up spending more than you originally planned for. That is not to say that Mbeumo is struggling to live up to his price tag - but it is something to consider.",
      "When you take into account the big defensive midfield signings in recent years like Moises Caicedo to Chelsea and Declan Rice to Arsenal, the £100m mark has already been breached. That is also the figure that Brighton quoted United for Carlos Baleba last summer.",
      "Sadly, his performances this season do not merit such a high fee. So therein lies the problem for Wilcox and his recruitment team.",
      "Signing a player from the Premier League to replace Casemiro would be ideal. However, that will cost United big money and, currently, there is not one target who fits the mould well enough to constitute paying that money.",
      "United may need to go back to the drawing board and spread their net further afield.",

      "In Febraury, the Brazilian heavyweights forked out £21m to sign him from Barcelona. The Catalans hold a 20% sell-on clause, meaning the Brazilians will need a substantial sum if they are to profit.",
      "Speaking on the official Manchester United website, Wilcox said: \"It is so important. I think you have to bring players in that bring something different to the changing room.",
      "\"The most important thing is that, whenever we bring in a player, they have to want to improve and they have to be a team player, and understand what it means to be part of a successful team.",
      "\"It is not about putting the Harlem Globetrotters together. If I look at successful Man United teams, there were very functional players that would die for the badge and there were some mavericks.",
      "\"When you talk about Cantona, when you hear anybody talk about him, he was an ultimate professional. When I look now and I see the car park, when the report time is 09:45, you see the lads coming in at 08:30, 08:45, preparing for training, and this is a good sign.",
      "\"The mood on the training pitch hasn't really changed, the intensity on the training pitch and the noise level hasn't really changed, winning or losing.",
      "\"Of course, when you lose a football match, there is a lot of disappointment and a lot of frustration but, once they are on that training pitch, the character, the team spirit, you can feel it, you can feel the energy growing and we have just got to keep it going.\""

      "Hojlund did not score enough goals last season and paid the price. United looked toothless with Hojlund up front in the Europa League final and signing a new striker was a non-negotiable.",
      "Benjamin Sesko arrived with a similar profile to Hojlund, given his age and lack of experience in the Premier League, and he looks to be gradually finding his feet in Manchester after a slow start at the club.",
      "Gary Neville said Sesko was \"miles off it\" after the Nottingham Forest draw. Neville has copped flak for his comment, but Sesko would concede he would like to have more than two goals to his name by this point in the season.",
      "Sesko has huge potential and can become a 20-goal-per-season forward. The decision to sign him from RB Leipzig should pay off in eventually, although United fans may have to be patient.",
      "That is why Senne Lammens' performances have been so impressive. Every young foreign player must be given time to adapt to the Premier League, but Lammens has made a seamless transition.",
      "Amorim delayed Lammens' debut and finally played him against Sunderland last month. The \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chant was enough to tell you how he performed that day.",
      "Lammens looks remarkably confident and assured for a 23-year-old playing in one of the most difficult positions at the most scrutinised club in the country, but it becomes obvious when he speaks why he has made such an impact - he is laid back, confident and intelligent.",
      "\"I think you just try to be like yourself, don't really overthink it, it's just a game, to be honest, at the end of the day,\" said Lammens after the Liverpool victory. He celebrated by having dinner with a close friend.",
      "The Belgian has been viewed as a huge upgrade on Onana after just four appearances. He oozes confidence, whereas Onana was error-prone and made his teammates second-guess themselves.",
      "The decisions from Amorim to freshen up the top and bottom of the team should both pay off, but the Lammens decision has immediately paid off, while Sesko is a work in progress.",
      "That does not mean Lammens cannot improve or that Sesko has not been a good signing. Lammens will inevitably make mistakes and Sesko has looked sharp, he just needs a few more goals to his name.",
      "United spent £215million in the summer transfer window (excluding add-ons) and the recruitment looks good.",
      "United have not been able to say that about many transfer windows across the last decade.",

      "Out-on-loan Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is playing with a point to prove at Napoli following his summer transfer window move - according to one expert on the club.",
      "The Dane was not expected to depart this summer. However, when Benjamin Sesko pitched up at Old Trafford, Hojlund's position changed.",
      "If he were to leave, a permanent move was one which was preferred to provide Hojlund with stability. That was not forthcoming, but a loan to Napoli with an obligation to buy, was.",
      "Like Scott McTominay before him, Hojlund has enjoyed a positive start to life in Naples. The frontman has scored four goals in nine appearances and the confidence is clearly flowing once again.",
      "\"Napoli fans are pretty much everywhere in Italy when Hojlund arrived, Napoli did the medical tests in Rome and when he arrived, there were so many Napoli fans welcoming him,\" Bettoni said. \"Fans were pretty happy with the signing because what he showed in his season at Atalanta was pretty promising.",
      "\"Even if the time at Manchester United wasn't excellent for him, far from it, but they were pretty happy.\" The love of the Napoli fanbase will be one of the driving factors for the United recruits switching Old Trafford for the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.",
      "Bettoni believes that Hojlund may be gaining the inspiration from elsewhere, too. \"There is a factor in the player's mentality, as well,\" he continued.",
      "\"You can see by the way he plays that he has something personal to prove because clearly the last two seasons at Manchester United weren't very good. Knowing Conte, he would have talked about this with the player.",
      "\"It's an important task for Hojlund, because he needs to lead the attack while [Romelu] Lukaku is injured. So he has a personal point to prove as well, because he wants to show what kind of striker he is and I think the way Conte motivates the players it is one more reason why he looks so excited to play and is really willing to make an impact.\"",
      "Few would have predicted this summer that Hojlund would be assisted by Kevin De Bruyne during this campaign. But that is how it has played out for the forward as the pair joined forces to devastating effect in the victory over Sporting CP in the Champions League.",
      "Hojlund will likely have to do without De Bruyne until February due to injury and Bettoni has warned that the striker will need to adapt his style in the interim. \"On paper, we have not seen so much of Hojlund without De Bruyne so far,\" he concluded.",
      "\"Technically it will be more about holding the ball and a few less runs into the spaces, but this is just technically because in games when Napoli decide to sit deep and not press too high and not try to win the ball high up the pitch, they will need to counter-attack and Hojlund will be a very important player in this phase as well. Against other teams, without De Bruyne, Hojlund will need to be a lot more involved in the link-up and much more solid physically so that he can hold up the ball, link-up with the wingers and the central midfielders, as well.",
      "\"It will be a lot more about the link-up play and trying to work well with his teammates rather than just trying to make forward runs and runs into spaces.\"",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on Mainoo's future, suggesting that a move away in January may be on the cards. On the Here We Go podcast, Romano has claimed that Mainoo is open to leaving United on a loan deal in January that would run until the end of the season.",

      "Just two days after confirmation of Jota and Silva's deaths, a funeral was held in their hometown of Gondomar, Portugal, attended by several former teammates. However, one prominent name was missing from the attendees - Ronaldo, who had played alongside Jota in the Portugal national team for six years, chose not to attend.",
      "Ronaldo has now explained his absence from the funeral. In an interview with Piers Morgan, he stated: \"People criticised me a lot, I don't care about that because when you feel free you don't have to worry about what the people say. But one of the things I don't do is, after my father died I have never been to a cemetery again.",
      "\"Second, and you know my reputation, wherever I go it's a circus. I didn't go also because if I go the attention goes to me and I don't want this kind of attention.",
      "\"I saw, and I'm not criticising it, when you go into a sensitive moment, you do interviews to speak about him and speak about football. Come on guys what is this..",
      "\"This shows how secret life is sometimes, I am not part of that. If you want to be part of this world, good luck but I am going to be on the other side. People can continue to criticise me, but I felt good with my decision.\"",
      "Despite Ronaldo's absence from Jota's funeral, he offered a heartfelt tribute to the former Liverpool star and shared the devastating moment he learnt of his passing.",
      "\"I was with Geo (Georgina Rodriguez) alone,\" the 40-year-old Ronaldo revealed. \"I was in our period of rest in the gym in the morning. I didn't believe it when they sent me the messages. I cried a lot, Geo can confirm that.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment for the country, for the family, for friends, for teammates. It was very sad news.\"",

      "The striker had been visiting his native Portugal after appearing as a substitute in the country's penalty shootout triumph over Spain in the Nations League final on June 8.

      "Wrexham have been advised to steer clear of Memphis Depay in a damning transfer verdict for the Manchester United flop.",
      "The Red Dragons have experienced remarkable success under Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney in recent seasons, securing three successive promotions. Now competing in the Championship, boss Phil Parkinson reportedly operates under a stringent \"no idiots\" policy regarding new signings.",
      "However, as Wrexham pursue Premier League status, opportunities to acquire high-profile players who could destabilise harmony within the team are likely to increase. Depay is a player who may soon be on the market after being told to vacate his lavish £35,000-per-month accommodation funded by current employers Corinthians.",
      "The forward's future remains uncertain amid financial difficulties at the Brazilian outfit. Depay reportedly earns a salary of around £90,000 per week at Corinthians, along with receiving significant performance-related bonuses.",
      "In addition to approximately £3million already paid to the player, the club covers his luxury living arrangements. The perks are said to include a presidential suite, private chef and butler, personal security, an armoured car with driver, plus 24 business-class flights to Europe per year and a VIP box at the stadium.",
      "Ex-United first team coach Rene Meulensteen considers the Dutch attacker a prime example of the calibre of player Wrexham should steer clear of in their quest for top-flight football. Instead, he has urged the Welsh side to emulate Premier League newcomers Sunderland, who secured the proven quality of former Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka during the summer transfer window and are now benefiting from that decision.",
      "The Black Cats currently sit fourth in the table following a strong start to the campaign, recording five victories, three draws and only two losses. When questioned about what guidance he would offer Wrexham in their pursuit of success, Meulensteen told compare.bet: \"If I was Wrexham, I wouldn't sign Memphis Depay. If you go on that road, signing superstars, you need to make sure that they come up with the goods and they perform.",
      "\"Wrexham already have their big superstars on the sideline with the owners. What they need to do is constructively build a team that can hold their own within the Championship and potentially in the Premier League. That takes a combination of quality, discipline and energy.",
      "\"Not just the big name that steps on the pitch and you hope for the best. Will it be a draw for some respectable players? I couldn't see why not, especially if they get into the Premier League, but they have to be really solid professionals.",
      "\"Look at Granit Xhaka going to Sunderland. He'd done it with Arsenal, went to Bayer Leverkusen, won the league and did extremely well before coming back to Sunderland, and he's been a hit.\"",
      "He added: \"That's what Wrexham will need. Xhaka is the kind of experienced professional you need to bring in. Sound pros. Not just somebody that turns up once every three weeks.\"",
      "Depay arrived at Old Trafford for £25million from PSV in 2015 with the promise of huge potential, but he scored just seven goals in 53 appearances before departing for Lyon in 2015. He had far more success on the continent and is the Netherlands' all-time top goalscorer.",

      "The United head coach wanted to take on his new role at the end of the 2024/25 season, but Ineos were insistent. It was either November or never – Amorim chose to jump on board.",
      "His first press conference at Carrington was not held until later that month. Beaming in front of the packed press conference room, Amorim set out a positive message as he looked to bring the current squad on the journey with him.",
      "\"I am a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself,\" he said back then. \"I also believe in the club, as I think we have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help. But I truly believe in the players also, I know that you guys don't believe a lot in these players, but I believe a lot and I think we have room to improve.\"",
      "Fast forward to November 2025, Amorim may not have got the perfect result, but he did get the perfect gift from one of his players in the post-match interviews. Speaking in the mixed zone to MEN Sport, Amad said something which will be music to the manager's ears.",
      "\"I think winning games always gives players confidence and now I think everyone is in a good moment as a team, we are learning every day with the manager because we believe in his system,\" Amad explained. \"But today we are really disappointed because, as a team, we didn’t win.",
      "\"Yeah, of course [we are making progress under Amorim]. At first it wasn’t easy for him and for us, but now we are trying to understand his system and we are trying to do the best every game and we want to win every game because we want to deliver with this club where they deserve to be and we are trying to do that also.\"",
      "Amad's vote of confidence for Amorim's system and way of playing will perhaps mean as much to the United boss as the backing Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave him in October. The Ivorian also believes that United are showing signs of improvement that were not there last season.",
      "\"I think now that the play is getting better and better every game,\" he added. \"When you win, you always have confidence.",
      "\"As a player, I am starting to learn this system with the manager because we are playing in a new system so we have to learn. I think we can get better every game, every day and we are training very hard and I hope we can bring this club to the next level.\"",
      "The only way that Amad and his teammates will be able to do that is by continuing to secure good results both at home and on the road. Next up is a trip to Tottenham Hotspur and the 23-year-old is under no illusions about the scale of that task.",
      "\"We will prepare the game in the week and we know Tottenham is a big team, a good team, we have to be focused until the end and try to have three points there,\" he concluded.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United would have lost against Nottingham Forest if the game had been played last season.",
      "United opened the scoring at the City Ground thanks to a header from Casemiro, but the match was turned on its head almost immediately after play resumed for the second half.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White levelled the scores in the 48th minute and Nicolo Savona made it 2-1 just two minutes later.",
      "Forest fans sensed their first win in the league since August, but Amad popped up with nine minutes remaining to score a stunning goal which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United would have lost the fixture last season and responded: \"Yeah.\"",
      "He paused before adding: \"By more goals [they would have lost]. That is my feeling.\"",
      "When asked why, Amorim said: \"It's the confidence, of course, it's completely different. We came from three good games and we have a different confidence. We understand each other better.",
      "\"We talk more about this, that football is like this, and we proved it this year. We can have bad moments, but suddenly we have three good games. So football is like that. And the game is like that also.",
      "\"We had good moments, we score, you can sense we are in control of the game when the first half finished. We started the second half, we suffer, disconnect for five minutes and that's enough in the Premier League, but we managed to recover from that, which is a good feeling.\"",
      "Discussing his thoughts on the game in further detail, Amorim said: \"We lost control of the game for five minutes and paid the price. We did some things well. Our level of energy dropped a little bit.",
      "\"And when our energy drops a little bit, you can feel it. We can play well, but it's not full power. But my feeling is that the players tried, really tried. They tried during the week and tried again today.",
      "\"In the past, if we had this kind of bad five minutes and we suffer two goals, we didn't recover. Today is a different feeling and you can sense we could win this game, but we weren't going to lose, and that's sometimes the feeling a big team sometimes has.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to win in the end, but we drew. We dropped two points. I think last year we suffered a lot. We want to win games and overcome these moments, but now they know how to do it.",
      "\"We just need to be inside of the game until the final 10 minutes of the game. That is part of football. In the past, we could have lost everything in the positions and the way we play the game.",
      "\"I think we are improving in that aspect. Again, we did some things right, but we also have potential to play so much better, which is the goal.\"",

      "Any disappointment for the home fans after the break was short-lived as by the 50th minute they were ahead. First, Morgan Gibbs-White powered a header beyond Senne Lammens before Nicolo Savona scrambled the ball in.",
      "In the end it was Amad who stole the headlines. His volley sent the away end wild and secured a deserved point for the Reds.",
      "Here are some of the moments you may have missed from the game:",
      "United practicing corners",
      "United practiced corners in their warm-up once again. Deliveries came from both sides before they moved into a small-sided game.",
      "United chose to focus on defending corners rather than attacking them in their warm-up, and while neither Forest goal came from a corner, both came from crosses into the box and so United's pre-match drills clearly did very little to improve their ability to defend crosses into the box.",
      "More work is needed.",
      "Maguire hint given",
      "Harry Maguire was named among the substitutes after missing the victory over Brighton. It was a welcome boost for the centre-back following his winner at Liverpool last month.",
      "However, a hint to his fitness was clear when the teams emerged for their warm-ups. Noussair Mazraoui and Maguire came out between 10-15 minutes after their teammates and while the Moroccan immediately joined in with the substitutes, Maguire did some running drills alone.",
      "Unsurprisingly he was an unused substitute at the City Ground.",
      "Neville targeted by chants",
      "On a couple of occasions United fans were reminded that Gary Neville is an unpopular figure at Forest. His comments about the owner Evangelos Marinakis last season saw him banned from co-commentary of Forest's Premier League finale against Chelsea.",
      "A new season has not come with a change of heart from the home faithful and it appears from the chants aimed at Neville that the United legend is still not welcome on the River Trent.",
      "Cunha practices the dark arts",
      "You would have expected Forest players to be surrounding referee Darren England as he walked off the pitch at half-time. But it was Matheus Cunha who led the complaints.",
      "He felt he had been pushed in the face just before the break by Ryan Yates. Cunha has previously worked with Diego Simeone and perhaps some of the Atletico Madrid boss' tricks have been taken on board to the Brazilian.",
      "United frustrations avoided",
      "The United analysts were sat in the press box during the game and for the most part you would not have noticed they were there. However, when United were losing and Benjamin Sesko passed the ball out of play, a recognisable thump of a hand hitting a desk could be heard.",
      "It was unfair on Sesko who enjoyed a good game and Amad's equaliser has perhaps saved the striker's sloppiness from being highlighted.",

      "The bulk of Forest's attacking play came down the opposite side to Yoro. That is perhaps a compliment to the Frenchman. 6",

      "Opened the scoring with a brilliant header. Looked tired as the game progressed, but completed 90 minutes in the Premier League for the first time this season. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was relatively quiet in the first half until he played a lovely delivery into the box for Casemiro's goal. Hit the post in the second half and Casemiro could not convert the rebound. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "There are always question marks around Dalot when he plays on the left side and he was exposed at various stages of the contest. Amorim demanded more from him and he didn't rise to the occasion. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Playing with huge confidence and could have recorded a few assists if chances had been taken. Played a teasing ball to Benjamin Sesko in the first half but the striker did not gamble on it. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",

      "Although he worked hard he wasn't at his creative best. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "An improvement on Dalot. 6",

      "Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett has insisted that Manchester United were fortunate not to concede a late penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men extended their unbeaten run after coming from behind to leave the City Ground with a point. After Casemiro put them ahead in the first-half, Forest went ahead through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona before Amad's strike in the 81st minute levelled the scoring.",
      "With the score still 2-1 and United pushing for a equaliser, Forest fans were left fuming when referee Darren England decided against awarding them a penalty. Ryan Yates' flick-on from a corner accidently hit Amad's arm after he mistimed his jump to head away.",
      "Despite protests from supporters and players, England opted not to point to the spot and United eventually equalised. The Premier League Match Centre account on X did not explain why the video assistant referee (VAR) decided not to intervene.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Hackett has insisted the decision was wrong, labelling the incident a \"clear handball offence\" in a post on X. It was the second controversial call that went against Forest after Sean Dyche was left furious with the way United's first goal occurred.",
      "The Forest boss was left angry that a corner was given in the build-up to Casemiro's opener. Savona looked to have kept the ball in play but the assistant on the far side flagged for a corner.",
      "“I just can’t understand it, you’re an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you’ve got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,” Dyche said.",
      "“I’ve got a better view and I’m not in the right position. That’s got to be wrong in the current climate. I’m a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.",
      "“For me, that’s five seconds of VAR: ‘Bang, that’s it, done, wrong decision.’ It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot. With all the technology and all that’s at stake, particularly for us at Nottingham Forest after the start the club has had, that’s a big moment.",
      "“We all want it right, every fan wants it right. The worst thing, I’m back in the game for three games and for two weeks on the trot I’m talking about refereeing decisions. I want to be talking about my team.”",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir would have struggled to believe his luck at the start of the Premier League campaign.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, Bayindir struggled for any minutes at all, with Andre Onana the clear first choice.",
      "After an injury picked up by Onana during the summer, Ruben Amorim chose to trust Bayindir with the gloves. The Cameroonian's poor performance at Grimsby Town, followed by his subsequent exit to Trabzonspor, appeared to have cemented Bayindir's place in the starting XI.",
      "And yet, after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, Amorim chose to give Senne Lammens his opportunity and he has not looked back. The Belgian has been impressive and the comparisons from the Stretford End to Peter Schmeichel are of course tongue in cheek but a sign of how good he has been.",
      "Bayindir is now back down the pecking order as second choice at Old Trafford and, with the World Cup coming up at the end of the season, it would be no surprise if he seeks an exit. Amorim may be reluctant to allow him to leave without a replacement lined up, but would he really stop him leaving if a decent bid was tabled?",
      "If Bayindir goes in January, it would see Tom Heaton pushed into an unexpected new role as second choice goalkeeper, should a replacement not arrive in the mid-season window.",
      "If that happens, it would be a fitting half season for Heaton, especially when he is expected to retire at the end of the campaign. The 39-year-old has had a brilliant career, and to finish up back at United as a regular in the matchday squad would be a solid achievement.",
      "If Bayindir does choose to leave, Heaton may be handed a promotion.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results. There are only five teams left unbeaten in the Champions League, and three of those are Arsenal, Man City and Spurs.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 12th, while Villa and Palace also look near certainties to progress from the Europa and Conference respectively. For all their nonsense, Forest ought to be fine in the end too.",
      "Total points: 89.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",
      "Total points: 62.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",

But the big three should all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night warriors.",

      "A stunning yet inevitably unsustainable effort. Pafos have a win and two draws in the Champions League league stage having made it all the way from the second qualifying round, while Larnaca are flying high at fourth in the current Conference table.",
      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently around the cut line at 24th and 26th.",

      "Zirkzee moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2024 when compatriot Erik ten Hag was still at the club after a good season for Serie A side Bologna.",
      "The Netherlands international cost Man Utd £36.5m with Zirkzee contributing six goal and two assists in 51 appearances in all competitions since joining.",
      "Only 21 of those appearances have come from the start of matches with Zirkzee being used as a substitute more often that not, especially this season.",

      "READ: Five fascinating insights as Man Utd chief Wilcox talks Harlem Globetrotters, Sesko and Amorim",
      "Gullit told The Metro: “I think from my point of view that he should have stayed in Italy, because he was really striving.",
      "“He was really doing well at Bologna, and I was hoping that he would go to Milan. I think that as soon as he went to Manchester United, it was the wrong decision.",

      "Romano has said on his YouTube channel: “Joshua Zirkzee has not formally asked to leave Manchester United, but he is in a similar position to Mainoo – eager for more game time ahead of the World Cup. He remains professional and fully focused in training, and Ruben Amorim is happy with his attitude.",
      "“That said, interest is building. West Ham are looking for a striker and have Zirkzee on their shortlist, while Roma in Italy are also exploring the situation. Whether he moves will depend entirely on United’s approval for a loan deal. If given the green light, England and Italy are likely destinations.”",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another player who could leave Man Utd in the January transfer window with Romano bring an update on Zirkzee’s team-mate.",
      "Romano added: “Kobbie Mainoo wanted to go on loan late in the summer transfer window, but Manchester United and Ruben Amorim decided against it at the time. Mainoo is still not playing regularly, so he remains open to a six-month loan move in January, returning to United in the summer.",
      "“The final decision will depend on Manchester United’s plans – whether they bring in another midfielder, and on Amorim’s preference to maintain his current squad. There is interest from West Ham, offering guaranteed minutes, and from Napoli, who are looking for midfield cover after Kevin De Bruyne’s injury.”",

The fact that lock-the-game-down change precipitated the most astonishing five minutes of attacking football yet seen from Spurs in this deeply weird season again leaves us pondering just where Xavi stands in it all.",
      "The talent is there, and he will clearly be given time and perhaps a fine game even against a team as poor as Copenhagen is all he needs to get the confidence going again. But unless and until there’s some halfway compelling evidence of it against proper teams, he is going to face inevitable questions about the Bundesliga Tax and whether he’s quite cut out for Our League, and some of those questions will be reasonable and not just ones in ridiculous terms from ridiculous gobsh*tes like Jamie O’Hara.",

      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox has made an appearance on a new podcast series for the Red Devils’ official website called ‘Inside Carrington’.",
      "Wilcox has gone from complete silence to two interviews in a week after the tide has turned in a positive direction for Man Utd over the past month.",
      "Ruben Amorim won his first back-to-back games since arriving at Old Trafford a year ago and those two wins turned into three when they beat Brighton 4-2 late last month.",
      "A 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest at the weekend would have been a great result last season and it was important this campaign in order to keep Amorim’s unbeaten run going.",
      "Confidence is slowly building at Old Trafford with Man Utd supporters no longer looking ahead to matches with trepidation.",
      "A few good results on the bounce has already seen Wilcox pat himself on the back and now he has had a deep dive into various subjects to do with the club.",
      "Here are five of his most fascinating insights from the ‘Inside Carrington’ interview…",
      "",
      "Wilcox said: “It is not about putting the Harlem Globetrotters together. If I look at successful Man United teams, there were very functional players that would die for the badge and there were some mavericks.”",
      "On what the Red Devils are looking for, the Man Utd director of football added: “Last year’s summer window [2024] was a lot more chaotic than this one and this one was really calm. With this one, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "“These are continuous meetings with myself and Ruben [Amorim], with Chris Vivell and with his team underneath, where we are very clear on the profiles that we need. So, the brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris, there is a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles that we need, and then the scouts will go into the market, we will combine that with the data team and then there will just be constant dialogue.",
      "“Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable, with Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach. When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process. The data team are involved in the process and we will then focus all our attention on certain players.”",
      "“It is really important then that we do the background checks on whether they are clean-living professionals. This is really important. This year, we looked at Premier League-ready players and certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn’t take too much risk in this area. We needed players that we could plug in and play, with little transition time.”",
      "",
      "“Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers that have got huge potential. Senne was available and we decided to move, but it wasn’t a kneejerk reaction. Tony Coton was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it. This guy is going to be a top signing for us and he has started well, but he has got to keep it going. He is very reflective and he is very professional with his approach.”",
      "",
      "“Benji, at the top end, he’s going to be an amazing player. It’s difficult to be the no.9 at United and I know sometimes that Matheus and Bryan are getting a lot of credit, but the runs that Benji is making is also helping Matheus and Bryan as well.",
      "“All four of them have done really well, the summer signings from last year, they are top professionals.”",
      "",
      "“We’ve just got to continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben’s idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea. It’s a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for. We have got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, it is really important and we have to put the jigsaw pieces together.",
      "“Putting the jigsaw pieces together, we would love to have all of the pieces in place where we can see a very, very clear picture but, whilst we are building and whilst we are building the picture, it is even more difficult when you lose some football matches because people start questioning things. But we are really clear, myself and Ruben, Omar [Berrada], the ownership, we are really clear on the direction of travel and this is really important.”",
      "",
      "“All we are doing now is making sure that we make decisions for the football club and not for the benefit, not for the short-term protection of ourselves, we’re making some really bold decisions for the future of Man United.",
      "“Man United is bigger than any player, any manager, any staff member. We are custodians, if you like, and we’ve just got to understand that at some point our journey will end, inevitably.",
      "“We need to make sure that when we leave this football club, whenever that is, and I hope I am here for a long, long time, that this football club is in a much better position.”",
      "Ruben Amorim admits Man Utd have “made a lot of mistakes” but insists his side are “improving” after criticism from Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has not minced his words on his former club and Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Wolves getting rid of Vitor Pereira leaves two joint-favourites in the Sack Race, though one manager is surely the most likely to go next…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should now be aiming for a top-four finish in the Premier League after their recent run of form, according to Lee Sharpe.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",

      "Man Utd are “very unlikely” to allow wantaway duo Joshua Zirkzee or Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in January, according to the club’s former chief scout.",
      "After an inconsistent start to the new Premier League season, the Red Devils have come into form in recent weeks with ten points from their last four matches.",
      "Three wins and a draw in their last four Premier League games has seen the pressure ease on Ruben Amorim ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Man Utd could now be more inclined to give Amorim what he wants in the winter with a midfielder understood to be on their shopping list.",
      "The Red Devils could also face a fight to keep Mainoo and Zirkzee with both players looking to get some game time ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "But former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown – who remains well-connected at Old Trafford – insists that the Red Devils are keen to keep Mainoo and Zirkzee – despite neither of them starting a Premier League match this season – with Amorim looking to keep his squad together.",
      "READ: Arsenal lose, United beat Spurs, City beat Liverpool: Five things to mitigate the worst interlull ever",
      "Brown told Football Insider: “Ruben Amorim does not want to lose players in January.",
      "“It’s United’s own fault that they’re in this situation, particularly for the way Kobbie Mainoo has been treated since the summer window was open.",
      "“He was one of their top performers last season, so all of a sudden for him to be barely getting a kick and entertaining offers, that’s not a good situation to be in.",
      "“But I still don’t think they’ll be open to losing him mid-way through the season because as an option either off the bench or for rotation, he’s very important.",
      "“The same goes for Zirkzee, he’s been sidelined for a while, but he’s still the type of player you’d want in your squad even if he’s not playing every game.",
      "“Whether he’s happy with that, I’m not sure, but from the manager’s point of view he wants to keep him around because he’s a good depth option.",
      "“You never know if you’re going to pick up a couple of injuries or something like that, and all of a sudden these are the players you need to be calling on.",
      "“So I think it’s very unlikely that they’ll be letting those two leave in January, and the same goes for a number of players on the fringes of the squad.”",
      "Man Utd have also been linked with several forwards with Benjamin Sesko struggling to adapt to the Premier League but Fabrizio Romano has given them “zero” chance of signing Real Madrid’s Endrick.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Rumours about Endrick joining Manchester United are zero because he wants to play.",
      "“He would be ready to compete, as he is doing at Real Madrid, but what he wants most right now is regular playing time to show his skills and develop.”",
      "A Manchester United star with 10 clubs reportedly tracking him will push for an exit in January, with a source saying “make no mistake about it.”",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are intensifying their pursuit of Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, viewing him as a prime and realistic target for the January transfer window, and TEAMtalk can reveal an offer is being prepped.",
      "Sources close to Man Utd indicate that the Red Devils are confident of securing a deal, despite Forest’s firm stance on demanding a substantial fee.",
      "Anderson, the 22-year-old England star who joined Forest from Newcastle United in a £35million deal last summer, has quickly established himself as a key player at the City Ground.",
      "His energetic displays in midfield have caught the eye of United’s boss, Ruben Amorim, who sources say is desperate to inject more dynamism and legs into his engine room.",
      "With the team getting better but struggling for consistency in the Premier League, Amorim sees Anderson’s relentless work rate, pressing ability, and box-to-box stamina as the perfect fit for his high-intensity system.",
      "Another key attribute wooing higher-ups at Man Utd is Anderson’s ability to break the lines with his pinpoint passing.",
      "Such a trait meshes well with Amorim’s attacking philosophy which prioritises faster-paced attacks over more measured and deliberate build-ups.",
      "United’s belief in landing Anderson stems from multiple factors.",
      "Club insiders reveal that the player himself would be “very keen” on a move to Old Trafford, attracted by the opportunity to compete at the highest level and the chance to immerse himself in the prestige of a ‘big six’ club.",
      "This mutual interest could prove pivotal in negotiations, especially as United scout the market for affordable reinforcements amid financial fair play constraints.",
      "However, Nottingham Forest have drawn a clear line in the sand: pay big money or back off.",
      "Forest are under no pressure to sell and value Anderson highly after his seamless integration.",
      "As such, we understand Forest are setting their stall out around the £80m mark, though United believe a deal can be struck for closer to £60m.",
      "Anderson’s contributions have been perhaps the brightest spark at the City Ground this term in what has otherwise been a season of doom and gloom for the 19th-placed side so far.",
      "Forest are well aware losing Anderson would have a detrimental effect on their ability to stave off relegation, thus ensuring they’ll put up stiff resistance if Man Utd do act on their interest and thunder in with a significant bid.",
      "Amorim’s tactical blueprint demands midfielders who can cover ground relentlessly, and Anderson’s profile aligns perfectly.",
      "Amorim operates with a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro the most selected midfield pairing in between the wing-backs this season.",
      "Given the wing-backs are tasked with controlling an entire flank by themselves, United’s two-man midfield can often be exposed against teams who deploy three in the middle. This is just one of the reasons why a relentless engine is such a valued trait for Amorim when the Portuguese signs midfielders.",
      "United’s hierarchy shares Amorim’s adoration of the player, along with his optimism a deal CAN be made in the winter window.",
      "Accordingly, sources state the club are prepared to test Forest’s resolve with a structured offer that would total a figure around £60m.",
      "As the January window approaches, this saga could define United’s mid-season revival. Will Forest hold firm, or will Anderson’s ambition propel him to Manchester? The coming weeks will tell.",
      "In other news, TEAMtalk can reveal the primary reason why United have abandoned their attempts to sign Endrick on loan in January.",
      "Elsewhere, Man Utd have been savaged for offloading a player who is now ‘unstoppable’.",
      "Finally, a report has detailed the ‘dilemma’ Ruben Amorim faces with a Man Utd star he can’t live with but can’t live without.",

      "Speaking to Adventure Gamers, Sharpe said: “Both Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu have struggled at left wing-back for Manchester United this season.",
      "“I’ve always thought Dalot is a bit sloppy in his decision-making at times – he gives the ball away cheaply and gets caught out of position defensively.

      "On Mbeumo, Sharpe added: “Bryan Mbeumo has been absolutely fantastic this season. It’s not just his ability to create chances and score goals, but his awareness of what’s going on in the game is what has particularly impressed me.",
      "“He’s always involved the game in some way – he never switches off, and you can tell that he was previous Premier League experience. His work rate is phenomenal as well – he’s always looking to run into gaps and create space for others.",

      "The 22-year-old has scored just two goals in 11 matches in all competitions since moving to Man Utd and has faced criticism in recent weeks.",

      "But former Liverpool midfielder Hamann insists that Sesko and Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade have been more impressive this season than Arsenal striker Gyokeres, who has scored six goals in 13 matches so far.",
      "When asked which player out of Sesko, Gyokeres and Woltemade will score the most goals this season, Hamann told footballblog.co.uk: ‘I think the club that will be creating the most chances will be Arsenal, and so that probably puts Gyokeres ahead of the other two, Woltemade and Sesko.",
      "“Of the three players, I think that Sesko and Woltemade have impressed me more than Gyokeres.",
      "“If Woltemade is the regular penalty taker for Newcastle from now until the end of the season, then I think I will put Woltemade down as the player to score the most out of those three this season.",

      "“He was always very confident and he’s got a lot of belief in his ability. But then when you come to a club where things are not great, it’s difficult for a striker.",
      "“Confidence is a big thing, and poor morale at a club doesn’t help. I think he’s done okay so far, but we certainly haven’t seen the best yet because he’s an exceptional talent.",
      "“People in Salzburg said at 16, 17, when he came to the club, he was better than Erling Haaland. Obviously that’s not the case at the moment, but I think potentially he could be a player who scores 20, 25 goals every season.”",

      "Is it the November international break, the third in quick succession and thus by definition always the hardest to drag yourself through? Yes.",

      "",
      "Famously something that Tottenham don’t really do anymore, their four wins against Manchester United last season even going so far as the truly absurd lengths of delivering a trophy to N17, but a lot has changed in the weeks and months since That Night in Bilbao.",
      "Man United’s recovery from deepest and darkest crisis still hasn’t been enough to get that lad a haircut after the 2-2 draw at Forest, but it’s still delivered 10 points in four games and that will very much do. And Liverpool’s win over Villa last week has taken the edge off slightly at Anfield.",
      "It’s going to be hard to concoct a full crisis for any of the Big Six now, but our best bet might be Thomas Frank over at Spurs after the most small-time ‘big club’ home performance in living memory against Chelsea. The initial plan appeared to be to play for a goalless draw and then, when that didn’t work out, play for a 1-0 defeat. It’s a mad plan for Spurs at home to absolutely anyone, but especially a Chelsea side that absolutely isn’t all that having lost to Sunderland the previous weekend and then nearly contrived all sorts of unpleasantness at desperate Wolves in the Carabao.",
      "Frank absolutely needs a result and a performance against United to silence some of the increasingly loud doubts and also at least start to turn around that laughably poor home form, albeit only some of which – but an inevitably increasing amount – has come on his watch.",
      "Lose to United for the first time in over three years, and Spurs will drop back into mid-table where, frankly, their performances deserve to have them. Do it in anything like a repeat of the drab, ambition-free nature of the Chelsea defeat and suddenly there’s a story to fill the void and an awkward couple of weeks for Frank before the blessed relief of another away game. Which is at Arsenal. Oof.",
      "",
      "Not sure City can be plunged easily back into crisis, but we’re damn sure Liverpool can. Nothing about the way a team that has conceded 14 goals already in the Premier League this season has gone about their defending suggests they are in any way ready to cope with Erling Haaland in his current preposterous pomp, so there really is every chance for a silly high-scoring game here that does much to sustain us through the days and nights that follow.",
      "Is a wild 5-3 in the last Premier League game for 13 days really too much to ask? We say no. No it is not. More defensive calamity. More Virgil van Dijk looking daggers at Milos Kerkez and wondering how it’s all come to this. More Haaland doing the robot.",
      "While we’re being greedy, we’ll take a Salah hat-trick at the other end as well, please. We just want a Super Sunday headliner that legitimately has enough going on to fill the next three days’ discourse. We won’t ask for anything ever again. Not until March anyway.",
      "We will grudgingly accept the reverse outcome – as we would with Spurs-United, to be fair – if it’s large and compelling and above all funny enough. But it really does feel like Spurs and Liverpool are our best crisis bets this weekend, the sheer futility of trying to predict what Chelsea might get up to having now been firmly established.",

      "Perhaps the greediest and unlikeliest request of the lot, but the less ridiculously we are able to spend the interlull kidding ourselves on that there might still be a title race, the better.",
      "It’s another factor, really, in why City beating Liverpool is better than the other way round, because City are currently that precious one point closer to the runaway leaders, which means any result other than a City win just means that Arsenal lead getting bigger again.",
      "Unless, and hear us out because it is technically possible, Arsenal don’t beat Sunderland. These lads are fourth in the league, after all. We really shouldn’t just be assuming Arsenal definitely beat them, even though assuming Arsenal definitely beat pretty much anyone feels entirely fair at this point what with the twin superpowers of never facing any shots on their own goal and always scoring at least one p*ss-boiling set-piece at the other.",
      "But maybe the chaotic and unexpected energy of Sunderland is just the thing to derail the serene Mikel Arteta machine. And for our own something-to-fill-the-void requirements, the greater the prominence of Granit Xhaka in any such spanner-in-the-works behaviour the better.",

      "Because if Bellingham is in the squad, at least the Bellingham Week stories that follow will have to make some kind of superficial nod to real-world events that actually happen rather than the press pack having completely free rein to just make up the narrative.",
      "Which brings us to the further mitigating requirements required here to try and damp down the crazy. First, Bellingham will need to play some part in the games and be quite good but not too good. If he’s conspicuously good or conspicuously bad, it’s all too easy for it to naturally become the dominant narrative anyway. Bellingham isn’t really a footballer who does ‘quietly effective’ but we are really going to need him to try.",
      "And if that can happen with the barest minimum of any accompanying behaviour that can be spun as Billy Big Bollocks antics, again it would really help.",
      "Obviously, there’s no actual proper solution here. Anything he does (or doesn’t do) will still constitute a display of true colours or the speaking of volumes but the more egregiously the media has to reach for it the better. Don’t be giving them any ammunition.",

      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has named four Red Devils players who “should be doing a lot better” for Ruben Amorim despite their age.",
      "After an inconsistent start to the season, which mirrored much of their form from the previous campaign, Man Utd seem to have potentially turned a corner under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have won three and drawn one of their last four Premier League matches as they have moved up the table into eighth and one point behind defending champions Liverpool, who occupy third position.",
      "Following some encouraging performances and results, Man Utd can now look ahead to the January transfer window and potentially continuing a rebuild under Amorim, who was rumoured to be on the verge of being sacked in early October.",
      "Despite their recent good form, Neville still reckons four players “should be doing a lot better” to hold the Man Utd team together.",
      "Neville told The Overlap and Betfair’s Stick to Cricket show: “I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man United, our spine was (Peter) Schmeichel, (Steve) Bruce, (Gary) Pallister, (Roy) Keane and (Eric) Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",

      "“De Ligt’s played a mountain of games at sort of different levels, the highest level. Harry’s played so many times for England. You’ve got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno have got massive experience.",
      "“Up front, they haven’t got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "“That’s why I think Liverpool are good because they’ve got Alisson, (Virgil) van Dijk, they’ve got (Alexis) Mac Allister and (Ryan) Gravenberch in midfield and then they’ve got obviously the centre-forwards that they’ve got.”",
      "A report came out in The Athletic which claimed Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi were the two prime candidates, alongside Amorim, to take over at Old Trafford before the Portuguese head coach was appointed.",
      "When asked for his thoughts on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand said: “Who cares?",
      "“We’re in the moment where Amorim is starting to find a bit of positivity, and then we’re writing about someone who could have or should have taken the job over a year ago.",

It is literally impossible to keep up, but suffice to say there now really are only a very small handful of managers considered entirely safe.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 15 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former now, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",

      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently five points outside a largely daft top eight, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 19 Premier League games, and just one from five very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raises the stakes. Feels like a really big week for Frank now with key home games in Europe and the Premier League to come before the interlull.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, and he’ll have been enormously grateful Spurs were so thoroughly wretched on Saturday evening.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table after 10 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis reached full-blown levels before Saturday’s much-needed win over Aston Villa, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It was six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competitions before they stopped the rot against Villa. It was a result that really was sorely needed to prevent the genuine possibility of something truly extraordinary happening to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season.",
      "",
      "That was a very, very good time to face Wolves, and Marco Silva took full advantage to end a losing run that was just beginning to tip him and Fulham towards trouble. We remain convinced of this: Fulham and Silva are both better off with each other than without, and both parties would do well to pause before thinking of doing anything rash.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re only just at one-quarter distance this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s miserable trio managed.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed despite a decent point against resurgent Manchester United.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, he desperately needed a statement performance and result to suggest he might be in possession of possible solutions. The win against Newcastle provided exactly that and surely buys him some time at least.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover.",
      "Ruben Amorim admits Man Utd have “made a lot of mistakes” but insists his side are “improving” after criticism from Cristiano Ronaldo.",

      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",
      "",
      "Manchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of Man Utd's current squad saying Ruben Amorim cannot work \"miracles\"; Man Utd are on a run of four unbeaten as they travel to Spurs on Saturday in a first meeting since their Europa League final loss",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now, and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, that we want the players to behave. We are doing that, and we are improving.",
      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 21:57, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and explains why Arsenal's winning streak will be under threat at Sunderland.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium should be a fortress - a new-build modern footballing arena full of intimidation. But right now it feels more like a luxury spa for visiting teams.",
      "Opponents don't turn up dreading it. They turn up enjoying it. It's football's version of checking into a five-star hotel. You get pampered, you play your game and more often than not, you leave with something to show for it.",
      "That's seen in Spurs' home record of late. In the last year, Spurs have the fewest points (13), fewest wins (3) and most defeats (12) at home than any other ever-present side and have kept just three clean sheets in the last 39 Premier League games at home.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are box office again. Not in the relentless, ruthless, title-challenging way of Sir Alex Ferguson's juggernaut but in the sense that you simply can't take your eyes off them.",
      "United aren't ready to challenge for honours yet. They are a team built for moments - not for consistency, meaning they can't be trusted still as a betting proposition in the win market where they are favourites here at 29/20 with Sky Bet. The greater value is found in their total goals line where the 10/11 for them to score over 1.5 goals rates as nice wager - something which has landed in seven of their last nine games.",
      "Jack Grealish and card-based plays are very much a profitable theme of this season. Grealish remains the most fouled player in the Premier League having been fouled 29 times. He's drawing cards from these fouls too with Trai Hume, Daniel Munoz, Matty Cash and Mads Wieffer all being booked for challenges on Grealish.",
      "Opponents are doubling up and generally spending 90 minutes trying to test his patience as much as his skill. When he doesn't get the decisions, the petulance tends to bubble up, which also makes Grealish a underrated player in the to be carded market himself.",
      "Grealish doesn't lose his head often, but when he does, it's usually in games exactly like this against a physical side who are happy to foul, frustrate and use game management techniques. It's 12/1 with Sky Bet for both Grealish's direct opponent Kenny Tete and Grealish to be carded.",
      "Keep an eye on Crysencio Summerville if you're looking to grab some value in the coming weeks.",
      "Because under Nuno Espirito Santo's new counter-attacking West Ham, the Dutchman looks built to be the headline act in the attacking prop markets. Nuno's blueprint took shape in their win over Newcastle: sit deep, soak up and strike. It's the same model that brought him success at Wolves and Nottingham Forest where defensive structure, lightning transitions and wide players given license to explode into space are to the fore.",
      "And that's where Summerville fits perfectly. He's been bubbling nicely under the radar with his performances for West Ham but could be about to take centre stage in this system based on his showing against Newcastle. He had three shots, one on target and a first goal of the season isn't far away. It may come here with 3/1 with Sky Bet standing out.",
      "Remember, football is defined by fine margins and is a very low-scoring sport.",
      "No matter how good of a team you are, a bit of variance and misfortune is going to hit you at some point. Arsenal are a fantastic team, keeping eight clean sheets in a row and winning the last 10 - it's incredible stuff but this isn't an unbeatable outfit. They have flaws.",
      "The outcomes in football are too volatile to allow perfection to persist.",
      "And when it comes to betting on football, the shrewdest of gamblers out there understand this and instead of chasing the streak, they are looking for opportunities for when it snaps.",
      "And at the prices here I want to be with Sunderland to end the Arsenal streak at the prices on offer.",
      "Sunderland are a fiercely organised side who are defensively secure. Robin Roefs has commanded his box very efficiently in goal to the extent that Sunderland have the second-best record in the Premier League when it comes to goals conceded from set-pieces. Arsenal can be very difficult to stop from such scenarios but Sunderland look well placed to deal with the set-piece machine.",
      "This is the time to be brave, sail against the market and get ahead of the 'bad day at the office for Arsenal' curve where all their streaks end.",
      "My main play is to back both teams to score at 6/5 with Sky Bet with eyes also on Sunderland to win at 7/1 and Sunderland to win to nil at 12/1.",
      "A nervous referee is a card-happy referee. We have an inexperienced one in charge here with Andrew Kitchen overseeing just his fourth Premier League game. This is the biggest and highest profile one he's been assigned to.",
      "With these inexperienced referees the pressure of refereeing by the law, not the spirit of the game, often takes over when the Premier League microscope zooms in. A tactical foul that in the Championship might have been managed with a word suddenly becomes a nailed-on booking in the Premier League.",
      "And Chelsea are just crazy for cards since the start of last season. Their games are averaging 4.9 yellows per game in that period - that's the highest of any team. Furthermore, this fixture does have lots of spice attached to it with the last six averaging 6.9 total cards per game, including the most recent Carabao Cup tie which saw nine yellows and a red shown.",
      "I'm very keen on backing the cards line with 11/10 with Sky Bet on offer for over 4.5 cards shown.",
      "Bournemouth will be rested, organised and fully revved under Andoni Iraola - and will surely fancy their chances of turning over an Aston Villa side running on European fumes. The Premier League calendar hasn't been kind to Aston Villa - facing Iraola's team after a midweek game is a brutal examination.",
      "Thursday nights in Europe are still glamorous but they take a toll. For all of Unai Emery's tactical acumen, his squad isn't yet deep enough to juggle the workload without something giving.",
      "Bournemouth have had a full week to prepare, to rest legs and to fine tune a high-tempo, front-foot plan under Iraola. They're one of the league's fittest sides, pressing with purpose and breaking with pace. All this hasn't been factored into the match prices enough so the Cherries look a nice price on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "Newcastle were \"unrecognisable\" according to their boss Eddie Howe in their 3-1 defeat to West Ham. The lack of intensity and attacking threat felt very un-Newcastle-like.",
      "Just a one-off then? No, it's not.",
      "Having looked a little deeper, these underwhelming displays and results away from St James' Park are an issue under Howe.",
      "At home Newcastle feel empowered - they press, they go at you and they look expansive and confident. On the road it's different. They're more cautious and Howe has struggled to find a formula that allows them to flourish away from the magic of St James' Park.",
      "The defeat at the London Stadium means Newcastle are now eight league games without a win on the road stretching across the summer. Jacob Murphy's strike on Sunday was also just their fourth goal scored across those eight matches and their expected goals data across that winless run is trending at a paltry 1.2 per 90. Horrendous numbers.",
      "Therefore, it's very surprising to see them chalked up as favourites to win at Brentford with the home side available at Evens on the draw no bet.",
      "Writing about Danny Welbeck being in the form of his life in 2025 was not on my radar - but here we are.",
      "The Brighton front man is purring with confidence, looking sharper, hungrier and crucially for punters, more productive than ever. He's clocked up six goal involvements in his last six appearances, and if you zoom in on his recent minutes against Palace, it's even more impressive: three goal involvements in his last 150 minutes.",
      "These aren't streaky stats, they're signs of a player who's thriving in Fabian Hurzeler's fluid attacking structure. So, at 7/4 with Sky Bet for a goal or an assist? That's value.",
      "Sean Dyche is certainly getting to work. His fingerprints are already all over Forest's recent performances. There's been a higher ratio of long passes, more pressures in the final third and already the quality of chances Forest are facing is much lower than when under the gaze of Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Dyche is doing the sensible thing and making Forest much harder to score against.",
      "It's that defensive improvement shown under Dyche and Leeds' flakiness in attack that makes a Forest clean sheet easy to fancy here. They are actually 18 Premier League games without one - the club's worst run since 1960. And Dyche will be losing sleep over something like that.",
      "If you look back at Dyche's last 18 games as a manager, 15 of those landed for punters backing 'no' in the both teams to score market.",
      "It's 10/11 with Sky Bet to go in again.",
      "For punters eyeing up the first goalscorer market this weekend with Erling Haaland in their sights, it's worth asking whether the Norwegian's price truly stacks up at 3/1 with Sky Bet. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.",
      "The bookies dangle Haaland up at skinny odds and the rest of City's attacking talent gets priced as if they're supporting actors. That might make sense when City are bullying lesser sides but Liverpool are not that. And against Virgil van Dijk, Haaland's aura tends to dim.",
      "The goalscoring machine has malfunctioned when faced with Van Dijk, scoring just two goals in seven appearances for club and country.",
      "When Haaland can't dominate physically, City often find joy elsewhere and that's where the value creeps in.",
      "Step forward Phil Foden, who is back to his best and brimming with confidence.",
      "From October onwards in the 23/24 season, Foden was one of the hottest players on the planet, scoring 25 goals in all competitions during that period - a ratio of 0.7 goals per 90. His two goals in midweek pointed towards a return of those numbers which makes his 7/1 with Sky Bet quotes for the first goal look rather generous in a game that looks so difficult to call from an outright perspective.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",

      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",

      "INCIDENT: Man Utd's first goal comes after a dubious corner is awarded. Corner complaints for Forest for the second week running - why won't VAR intervene for corners?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Why has the referee made that judgment? I don't know, because if the ball does go out and he doesn't see it, I can understand that, because he has got two goal posts there.",
      "\"He's got a goalkeeper, he's got [Nicolo] Savona himself in front of him, but he's made a judgment from 75 - 80 yards, incorrectly. You know, he's probably thought it's gone out, but it hasn't.",
      "\"The referee, I feel for as that depth, you're not going to see. If it hit the line like that, you wouldn't give a goal.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"The ball's definitely not gone out, and the fact that the linesman has made a judgment call from about, what, 70 yards. The referee was closer. I know he's a bit of a different angle, but the referee was definitely closer.",
      "\"It's just too far to say. But again, this is twice in two weeks now and I'm thinking to myself, well, there's goal line technology.",
      "\"Maybe that can be used across the whole byline, but then obviously, they can't change the rules this year, but it's definitely something they need to look at for next year, because it will cost teams ultimately.",
      "\"I think you can look at that in 10 seconds, and it will be cleared up and there will be no debate. They have enough time to look at that and make a decision.\"",
      "INCIDENT: The ball strikes Patrick Dorgu on the arm in the build-up to Amad's equaliser at Forest, but the goal stands.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It strikes his arm on the way through, but the rule is, has he scored? No, so he is not penalised for that.",
      "\"Is it deliberate? No, it brushes his arm on the way through, so it is not a deliberate play, so the game goes on, it gets cleared and he shoots.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Amadou Onana grabs Alexis Mac Allister by the throat in the penalty area while attacking a corner - why just a yellow?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The fact they were pushing and shoving each other and all right, he's raised his arm, probably a bit higher than he wanted, but he's pushing.",
      "\"Stuart's got to decide, is it violent? Is it an act of brutality? He said: 'No,' he's obviously relayed to the VAR what he's seen, VAR has checked it back. The referee said, yellow card only.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"As much as I like a physical game, I look at this situation, I'm like, if someone puts their hand on my throat in the street like that, you're gonna get an aggressive reaction from me.",
      "\"So in that instance, I'm saying that should be a red card, because obviously Mac Allister can't do that, right? Mac Allister has made the most of it. He's gone down, right? And that's probably because if he reacts, he'll get a red card too.",
      "\"So I think he's gone down there, and obviously, it's something that the official should have picked up.",
      "\"But I look at that and I say that is aggressive, because again, I reiterate, if that happens off the football pitch and someone does that to you, you're going to react in a certain way, which probably be aggressive, or you're going to call HR!\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gianluigi Donnarumma complained he was held by David Brooks as Bournemouth netted an equaliser from a corner at Man City.",

      "\"He's six foot seven, and his span upwards would probably be about nine feet. I don't understand why he's complaining there.",
      "\"He's complaining because he's punched that, but it's a bad punch and a goal has come of it. It's definitely not a foul. And I think keepers, again, I feel like they get too much protection, and in that scenario, for the referee, fantastic decision.",
      "\"He should be commanding that area more. The only person I've seen say it was a foul is Guardiola. What are we saying now? It's a non-contact sport.",
      "\"Brooks has definitely not fouled him. The referees have been consistent about this, and I think it's been good.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Rodrigo Bentancur avoids red for a tough challenge on Reece James.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think this is one of them. If he gets sent off, VAR is not bringing him back. I think it's more red than a yellow card.",
      "\"But I can understand the yellow on field. I think VAR is going to back the decision.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If he does get a red card there, I say, I understand why he got it, but then after that, I can understand as well why it's a yellow card. It's an aggressive challenge. It's one of those orange card challenges.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez is only shown a yellow card despite a studs-up high challenge on Spurs midfielder Joao Palhinha.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I definitely do not think this is a red card, his feet are up and it is a glancing blow, he has not gone through him, it is almost sideways. If he was in front and had gone through like that, he is in big trouble, but because of the angle he comes in at, he does not get the force or contact and so does not make the impact.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"I really like this decision from the ref. Enzo has tried to make an honest challenge there and just toe the ball away and as he has toe the ball away, his foot is obviously up, but his foot has hit the side of Palhinha's knee, so in that instance, it is not a reckless tackle, or a high challenge. From certain angles and a high speed, it looks a red.\"",
      "INCIDENT: West Ham have a penalty overturned by the VAR after it was deemed Malick Thiaw had got a touch on the ball first in his challenge with Jarrod Bowen.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Yes [right decision made], but I will also say when I first saw it I thought penalty, so I can understand why the referee [Robert Jones] first gave a penalty. When I saw the first replay, I knew it would be overturned.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"He has not touched the ball enough, the ball has not even changed speed, it is so minute that it should be given as a penalty, it is a crazy decision.",

      "",
      "There has been so much noise around Viktor Gyokeres this season.",
      "Is he good enough? Is he scoring enough? Is he doing enough?",
      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",
      "Gyokeres struck the opener from a corner as Mikel Arteta's side also improved on their league-leading set-piece goals tally before the striker's brilliant pass freed Leandro Trossard in the build up to Declan Rice's superb header.",
      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",
      "Gyokeres' injury will now be the concern for Arsenal - as will concerns over Martin Zubimendi, who was replaced in the second half.",
      "With Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Jesus still out after long-term injuries, the Gunners can't afford to lose much more quality, especially in the centre-forward position.Oliver Yew",
      "Sometimes this job is a real privilege. Watching Moises Caicedo up close was a real thrill - even the Tottenham fans would have to agree. This was a performance that showcased everything you want from a world-class midfielder. Tenacious, intelligent, full of quality and affecting the game in the final third. Jamie Redknapp called him \"world class, perhaps the best of his type in world football.\"",
      "It's hard to argue.",
      "The £115m price tag had seemed to hang around his neck like a glittering weight in his early days at Chelsea but we're now seeing the player that bulldozed opposition players at Brighton.",
      "There's something N'Golo Kanté-esque about him, not just in engine or energy, but in humility. He doesn't crave the spotlight, he craves the ball. And when he gets it, the whole game dances to his tune. Xavi Simons looked almost frightened at times to dribble near the Chelsea enforcer such was the domination in the duels.",
      "He has that fear factor now. And that's one of the main reasons why he's the best in the world at what he does.Lewis Jones",
      "To beat Tottenham looks simple at the moment: defend set pieces properly and you're onto a winner. Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",
      "For his and Wolves' sake, let's hope he finds it soon…Rich Morgan",
      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end.Adam Bate",
