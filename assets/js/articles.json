      "Roy Keane believes Ollie Watkins is capable of leading the line for Manchester United as the Red Devils focus in on the Aston Villa striker as their top target. Ruben Amorim has already added Mattheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to his attacking threat for the new season, but he is still on the hunt for a new No. 9 to front up his rebuild.",
      "It seems that United are shopping locally for their new signings, with Premier League experience clearly valued by the club's hierarchy this summer. Villa have remained adamant that Watkins is not for sale, but previously valued the 29-year-old at £60million, giving Old Trafford chiefs a benchmark to reach.",
      "However, United are confident that a compromise price of between £40m and £45m can be agreed between both parties to secure Watkins' services. Club icon Keane has weighed in on the Watkins debate before, stating that he believes the striker has what it takes to handle the pressure of a big club, as he put it.",
      "\"That’s a compliment to him, not that he has to leave Villa. But he’s capable of doing it.\" Discussing the striker's form at the time, Keane added: \"The kid is so sharp, he has a great shape to him. His movement is as good as any striker in the Premier League. He’s having an amazing season.\"",
      "Across 54 appearances last season, Watkins scored 17 goals and assisted 14 times. This type of return is exactly what United are after as they aim to improve what has been a disaster start to Amorim's reign.",
      "United already have two strikers on their books in Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, but it is safe to say the duo haven't exactly impressed during their time at the club. In total, Hojlund and Zirzkee have scored 17 goals between them, matching Watkins' solo endeavours at Villa last time out.",
      "Zirkzee only managed seven goals and three assists across all competitions for United following his £36.5m arrival last summer, while £72m man Hojlund hit 10 goals and four assists in 52 appearances. Amorim is aware that in order for his side to reach some level of success, he will require a more proven goalscoring record - and Watkins could be another cog in this puzzle.",
      "As well as Watkins, the Red Devils are also keeping tabs on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old was consistent for a struggling Bundesliga side last campaign, scoring 13 goals and assisting five times in 33 league appearances.",
      "Sesko also scored four times across eight Champions League games for Leipzig, proving he can hold his weight in European competitions too. However, a £70m price tag could be off-putting to United, given that they have already dropped over £120m on Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "The Red Devils also have other areas to prioritise and are in the market for a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper. Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have not convinced Amorim that either of them are capable enough to hold the No. 1 jersey, with both being used sporadically throughout the 2024/25 campaign, not to much success.",
      "The United boss also hopes to strengthen his midfield with a solid deep-laying playmaker, as Casemiro's veteran status rules him out of the starting position. Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are also both options, but Amorim seems to like playing Mainoo further forward - and it doesn't seem like he is happy with the £50m paid to bring Ugarte from PSG last summer.",
      "But number one on the manager's agenda is a new frontman, and with Newcastle United also in the race for Sesko's signature, Amorim may opt for Premier League pedigree and a cheaper fee in Watkins. Keane's seal of approval holds weight too, given his success in United's colours in years gone by.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Alongside Ollie Watkins, the 22-year-old RB Leipzig striker is being considered in the final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "It's believed that Watkins would be open to a move to United, while Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has kept communication lines open with the Red Devils since discussing a potential move last year.",
      "The Slovenian international has been a hot topic in the transfer market since the end of the 2024/25 season. Arsenal seemed keen on Sesko but decided to pursue Viktor Gyokeres instead, sealing a £63.7million deal for the Swede last week.",
      "Now, it appears United and Newcastle are vying for Sesko's signature, with both Amorim and Eddie Howe eager to bolster their attacking options. However, various reports suggest that the striker is more inclined towards a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Former Chelsea goalkeeper Petrovic had high praise for Sesko ahead of Euro 2024 last year, stating he \"has everything\" needed to succeed in the Premier League.",
      "Before the tournament, Petrovic had watched Sesko play several times and assured the Blues that he'd be a surefire success in the English top flight.",
      "\"I know [about the rumours linking him with Chelsea] and have been following him,\" Petrovic, who now plays for Bournemouth, told Nogomania. \"He's having a good half season, he's in great scoring form. I read that he's scored in his last seven matches in a row. He seems to have gained strong momentum for the Euros.",
      "\"He's a forward who has everything a modern player needs. He's tall, strong, fast and intelligent. I've watched some of his matches. Of course he can play in the Premier League. Absolutely! He has great potential, and he's been successfully proving it.\"",
      "According to Sky in Germany, United's board has been in touch with Sesko, and talks about a potential transfer to Old Trafford are possible. Should Sesko touch down in Manchester, manager Amorim has made it crystal clear exactly what he expects from any new recruits, saying: \"They have to want to come here.",
      "\"I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player.",
      "\"We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project. And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point.",
      "\"If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.\"",

      "Luke Shaw says Ruben Amorim’s hardline approach on his players is what is needed to take Manchester United back to the top.",
      "United ended last season in 15th place in the Premier League, their lowest finish for 51 years, and missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final. Amorim has made it his mission to restore high standards on and off the pitch at United and axed a group of players from the US tour to underline his uncompromising approach.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were all left off the US tour, while Marcus Rashford has gone on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Defender Shaw said ruthless Amorim’s refusal to compromise on his high standards is what United need if they are to have any hope of getting back to competing for major trophies. \"He’s extremely tough on the group,” said Shaw. “Everyone has to put the team first. He’s made that very clear.",
      "“There are no stragglers in this group anymore. Us players, especially the more experienced ones, need to be demanding more from a day-in, day-out basis.",
      "“The levels in training, keeping the times of when we’re doing this and doing that, making sure no one’s coming late or anything. We all need to up the level of demands. What Ruben definitely brings in is the demands, especially the mentality.",
      "“The mentality is a big thing. He talks a lot about it. Ruben demands 100 per cent and he doesn’t want anything less. If someone’s doing 85 to 90 per cent, it’s not enough for him. Especially this year, if you’re not doing the right things, I feel like you won’t play.",
      "“You’ve seen what he’s done in the past eight months with different players. He doesn’t care who the player is. If he’s not following what he wants, then that’s how it should be, and rightly so.”",
      "Shaw, currently United’s longest-serving player, has worked with five permanent managers in 11 years and admitted the atmosphere within the squad has been toxic at times.",
      "“It’s not hard to see from the outside what it’s been like,” said Shaw. “A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative. It can be quite toxic, the environment, it’s not healthy at all.",
      "“We need an environment that’s healthy, that’s positive, that’s got good energy and happiness. When you have all those things, you feel free and you can express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel the bond is growing.",

      "Liverpool will once again fail to lift back-to-back Premier League titles, according to a supercomputer which has predicted the full 2025-26 table. The Reds were crowned champions last season after a stunning start to life under new manager Arne Slot.",
      "Very few had backed Liverpool to win the title following the departure of Jurgen Klopp but a slump from Manchester City and Arsenal's failure to capitalise allowed Slot's side cruise to victory without a formidable challenge. That's set to change this term, though, with City having made 10 signings since the turn of year and Arsenal finally addressing their issues up front.",
      "Liverpool have, of course, spent more than anyone and won't stop at £269million. The reigning champions want to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak for a British-record transfer fee of at least £125m.",
      "That's after breaking the record to sign Florian Wirtz for an eye-watering £116m last month. But the supercomputer has Liverpool finishing THIRD - just as the Reds did in the 2020-21 season when they were defending champions under Klopp.",
      "Arsenal would finish second for the fourth year running, a new record, with City reclaiming the title under Pep Guardiola. There's also good news for Manchester United, who'd shoot up 10 places but narrowly miss out on Champions League football to Chelsea.",
      "Aston Villa would pip Tottenham to sixth place while Newcastle, West Ham and Everton round out the top half. Unfortunately for the three teams promoted from the Championship - Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds - they'd all go straight back down, a worrying trend which we've seen in the past two seasons.",
      "These are all predictions made by an AI supercomputer, via Sportscasting, which has simulated the upcoming Premier League season. Explaining City's title win, it said: \"Even without any seismic squad changes, their machine-like system - powered by Omar Marmoush, Phil Foden, the returning Rodri, and a 36-goal season from Erling Haaland - keeps them dominant.",
      "Who'll win the 2025-26 Premier League title? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"Their depth and consistency in tight matches give them the edge over Arsenal and Liverpool. Arne Slot's rebuilt side will feature a potent attack - with Mo Salah alongside new signings Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. But their defence will let them down against top teams, causing them to slip to third in the title race.\"",

      "Manchester United face a harsh reality as the club work on shipping out the players who wish to leave the club this summer. Manager Ruben Amorim left five first-team stars out of his pre-season plans ahead of Marcus Rashford’s loan move to Barcelona, having been informed that Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia also wanted to exit.",
      "Recouping money from the so-called 'bomb squad' could bolster United’s transfer plans. Yet, the Red Devils have reportedly lowered several of their valuations since the transfer window first opened, which will not be welcome news to United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Rashford has sealed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, who have a £26million option to make his stay at the Camp Nou permanent. That is a significant drop from United’s reported £100m valuation last April and is even less than the £40m price given to Aston Villa. However, United slashing Rashford’s past valuation by £74m is only a fraction of the total £213m United could lose as the club attempt to part with their wantaway players.",
      "Garnacho is another player whose price has dropped significantly since the start of the summer. The Argentine winger, who was linked with Chelsea and Napoli, was initially said to be worth £70m.",
      "However, United have since almost halved their asking price to £40m. This would represent a £30m difference in what United were expecting to receive from selling the talented 21-year-old, who scored 11 goals across all competitions.",
      "The writing appeared to be on the wall following Garnacho’s reaction to being named on the bench for the Europa League final last season. In the aftermath, Garnacho said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Antony’s productive loan spell at Real Betis last term would have boosted United’s hopes of recouping a significant portion of the £82m that they paid Ajax three years ago. The Red Devils quoted around £40m for Betis to sign the winger permanently, having scored nine goals and provided five assists in 26 appearances for the club.",
      "The price was deemed too high for Betis, though Antony’s valuation has remained around that mark. That would see United take a huge £42m hit on the Brazil international.",
      "Sancho is another high-profile signing who has never lived up to expectations at Old Trafford. There was plenty of fanfare when the England winger arrived for £73m in 2021 on the back of his sensational spell at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "However, Sancho failed to replicate that form for United before a fallout with ex-manager Erik ten Hag led to him being exiled from the squad in 2023. A brief return to Dortmund and a subsequent loan spell at Chelsea failed to prompt a permanent move.",
      "Football Italia has since reported that Juventus have made a £15m offer for Sancho, who is in the final year of his contract. This would be £58m less than his original transfer fee.",
      "Despite the financial hits that the club could take in the transfer market, United boss Amorim has insisted that he would welcome the players back into the fold if no deal can be finalised. “There are different reasons for the players [left behind],” he said.",
      "“Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams. We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide. If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players.",
      "“I know for a fact, these people, Jason [Wilcox, technical director], Omar [Berrada, chief executive] and the club have a number for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.",
      "“I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition if you want to play in the World Cup next year, so you need to play. I'm really happy with that because I have more options. If they have to fight each other to play one game a week, for me it’s perfect.”",

The Cameroon international scored 20 goals for Brentford in the Premier League last season and is now tasked with revitalising an ailing attack which managed just 44 goals in 38 league games in 2024/25.",
      "Mbeumo will aim to link up with fellow new arrival Matheus Cunha, while United are hoping to sign a centre-forward to complete their new-look frontline before the window closes. But whoever may be in the pipeline, Mbeumo is delighted to have Fernandes assisting him.",

      "“But at the end, I think on the pitch, when you're smart like he is, I think you don't even need to think a lot. You just need to make the run and he's going to play you in the right space every time.",
      "“But of course, you can have a little discussion to make him know how I prefer the balls and how I'm feeling the best to have the ball. But at a certain point, there is only one way, even if it's not the one you like, you have to do the run and he's going to put the ball in a good position.”",

      "The Aston Villa striker is keen on a move to Old Trafford, but United won’t pay £60m for his services, hoping to shake hands at £40-45m. They have also held talks with Benjamin Sesko’s representatives and he is an alternative.",
      "While a centre-forward is the top priority after a miserable 2024/25 season, Ruben Amorim still wants to strengthen elsewhere too. The Independent reports that they also want a new goalkeeper and a deep-lying midfielder.",
      "United are looking for a new keeper after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Onana was dropped by Amorim during the 2024/25 campaign, only for Bayindir to fail to take his chance when it came, too.",
      "They have been linked with ambitious interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma, as well as Newcastle’s Nick Pope and Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Meanwhile, an athletic holding midfielder is wanted by Amorim following a succession of issues last season in the position. Casemiro does not have the legs to cover the ground required, Kobbie Mainoo is better further forward and Manuel Ugarte is yet to convince following his £50m move from PSG last summer.",
      "Amorim has recently explained what he’s looking for in new signings. “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already,\" he said.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",

      "Ollie Watkins owes a huge part of his emergence to the partnership he forged with Bryan Mbeumo at Brentford with the pair now potentially reuniting at Manchester United as the club continue their summer recruitment.",
      "Watkins remains at Aston Villa whilst Mbeumo recently made the switch to the Red Devils, but both men formed part of a fearsome trio back during their Brentford days when the Bees were aiming to become a Premier League outfit.",
      "Said Benrahma was also part the attack but it was only Mbeumo who stayed with Brentford for the long haul. Watkins' goals saw Villa come calling whilst Benrahma headed to West Ham and is now in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The season they spent together in the Championship the trio scored 59 times between them as Brentford made it to the play-off final. This year just passed Mbeumo had a career-best year at Brentford and Watkins, who endured a frustrating season at Villa Park, came up with 17 goals.",
      "United are now eyeing a move for Watkins to further bolster their attack and the Englishman previously admitted he would love to have continued playing with Mbeumo.",
      "He said back in the Brentford days: \"I feel like coming from the bottom makes you hungry and you are always striving for more, so I am not surprised these two (Mbeumo and Benrahma) have been in the lower leagues and worked their way to the top and hopefully we can keep going up together.\"",
      "As well as Watkins, United are keeping track on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko situation but the Bundesliga club want around £70m for him and Newcastle are the most likely destination the 22-year-old Slovenian as they weigh up replacements for Alexander Isak.",

      "Manchester United are determined to sign a striker before the Premier League season begins. Ruben Amorim has already been given much-needed attacking reinforcements in the summer transfer window, but there's still a missing piece of the puzzle.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have arrived for a combined fee of £133.5million, but United are in real need of more goals. Cunha scored 15 goals in the Premier League last season for Wolves, while Mbeumo struck 20 for Brentford, yet neither are comfortable as a No.9.",
      "That is where United have been trying to find a new player. But with no European football to offer targets, having finished a lowly 15th last season, they missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal.",
      "United are, however, unwilling to pay Aston Villa's £60m valuation for the England star. Instead, they hope to negotiate down to around £40-45m for the 29-year-old forward.",
      "One of the things in their favour is that Watkins is understood to be keen on the move. While he has been an important player for Villa in recent years, he has clashed with Unai Emery over selection in the Champions League and would undoubtedly be the main man at United, where rotation would be less of an issue.",
      "Jadon Sancho had appeared to be set for a move to Juventus, but a third spell at Borussia Dortmund is now thought to be a serious possibility for the winger. Sancho is part of the bomb squad at United, having been told he has no future at the club under Amorim's management.",
      "He had agreed terms with Fenerbahce last month, before that move collapsed. Next came Juventus, with the Italian side thought to be close to signing the 25-year-old for £21.6m.",
      "According to reports, United could now flog Sancho to Dortmund for £15-17m, giving him a third spell at the club. Sancho made his name in Germany initially, joining United for £73m on the back of his form there, and also spent time on loan at Dortmund in 2024.",
      "Manchester United won't be signing Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea this summer. Jackson is exploring his options after the arrivals of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap left him contemplating a season on the bench. United held talks with his agent, but Chelsea's asking price has put them off.",
      "The Blues floated the figure of £100million, with an actual valuation of £80m still way too high for the Senegal international, who has a typically ludicrous but classic Chelsea contract expiry date of June 2033.",
      "Watkins is now United's No.1 target, with Sesko another option. United have spoken to Sesko's agent, but he is younger, more inexperienced and has no Premier League experience.",

      "Manchester United are keen on signing Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins this summer - but the club are reluctant to overpay for a player who turns 30 in December. And Arsenal had the same concerns before pulling out of the race to sign the England international.",
      "The Gunners explored a move for Watkins in January, but decided over the summer that Viktor Gyokeres was the answer to their needs up front. United have also looked at whether they might be able to land the forward, but are some way from an agreement.",
      "According to reports from The Athletic back in May, the Gunners' new sporting director Andrea Berta was unconvinced by the prospect of paying north of £40million for a player of Watkins' age. Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike were mentioned as potential alternatives at the time, though both have since joined different Premier League clubs.",
      "As an alternative, Amorim's side have spoken to Villa about the possibility of including Alejandro Garnacho in a player-plus-cash deal. Villa took Marcus Rashford on loan from United for the second half of last season, and Garnacho could yet fill the gap left by Rashford's decision to spend the upcoming season at Barcelona.",
      "In five Premier League seasons, Watkins has scored 75 league goals for Villa. His best return came in the 2023-24 season, when he bagged 19 in the league and 27 in all competitions.",
      "He finished last season with 16 in the league as Villa narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification. No United player ended up with more than eight.",
      "United have been in the United States for their pre-season responsibilities, earning a win against West Ham during the Premier League Summer series. After that victory, boss Amorim said he had yet to decide on his preferred XI for the league opener against Arsenal in mid-August.",

      "Sesko has been a standout player for RB Leipzig, scoring an impressive 21 goals across all competitions in the 2024/25 season. Despite the Bundesliga team's lacklustre performance, which saw them finish outside the top four, the Slovenian international remained a consistent force on the pitch.",
      "Ruben Amorim and United's hierarchy have noticed Sesko's prowess, but they're not the only ones. Newcastle are also keen to secure Sesko's services, particularly as Alexander Isak is now looking to explore other transfer options this summer.",
      "After extending his contract until 2029 last summer, Sesko will likely take some time to decide his next move. One person he'll likely turn to for advice is his girlfriend, Anita Vidovic.",
      "Cosmopolitan report the 27-year-old is originally from Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and graduated from the Faculty of Public Administration.",
      "Anita is no stranger to the world of football. Her brother Boris has made 25 professional appearances in Germany and Poland's lower leagues, playing for teams like TSV Bicken and Ritzing.",
      "The 28-year-old hung up his boots in 2024 and has since ventured into reality television, featuring in series 12 of Love Island as a Casa Amor bombshell. Whilst it remains unconfirmed, it's probable that the elder Vidovic supports Sesko in the same way as his sister, who regularly appears wearing her boyfriend's football shirt on social media.",
      "The Leipzig striker rarely shares posts about his partner on his social platforms, restricting Anita's appearances to the occasional Instagram grid post. On the other hand, the 27-year-old WAG displays her man's romantic side on her TikTok often.",
      "Garnering approximately 20,000 views per clip, Anita reveals Sesko's affectionate acts for birthdays, anniversaries and other memorable moments. Videos of the duo dancing, sharing warm embraces and travelling the world together fill her feed, alongside her cheering on the forward from the stands at Leipzig.",
      "In one post from early 2025, Anita compiled numerous romantic footage of the pair and wrote, \"It was always you,\" alongside a white love-heart emoji.",
      "Footage shows Sesko playing with a young lion cub, demonstrating his skills at the driving range, enjoying a basketball match and dancing aboard a boat with his girlfriend.",
      "United supporters will be hoping that Anita will persuade her partner to choose the Red Devils over other possible Premier League clubs, but it appears her influence may not be required.",
      "Sesko has reportedly been impressed by United's strategy and their eagerness to secure a deal. It's suggested he received concrete figures about what he could earn and bring to Amorim's vision.",
      "It's been reported that Sesko and Leipzig have a 'gentlemen's agreement', suggesting the 22-year-old could depart for a 'special club'. Given their rich history and trophy haul, United certainly fit the bill.",
      "However, given Eddie Howe's Carabao Cup-winning side are also interested in Sesko, their ability to offer Champions League football could tempt the Slovenian star.",
      "With other clubs eyeing Sesko, it appears Amorim and United's top brass will need to act swiftly to secure the forward. However, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is another player on United's radar, indicating it won't be a case of signing both.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is ready to show up Manchester United’s departing players after highlighting the importance of defending in his game. United last week announced the arrival of Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal which could reach £71million.",
      "The 25-year-old is an exciting addition to Ruben Amorim’s forward line, which struggled for goals last season. Mbeumo will certainly add that, with 20 Premier League finishes for the Bees last season showcasing his eye for goal, while his blistering pace will also add a new dynamic to United’s attacking trident.",
      "Yet, during an interview on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the Cameroon international highlighted another skill of his which was undoubtedly a factor in Amorim pushing so hard to sign him this summer - his impressive defensive work-rate.",
      "The forward was asked by United legend Ferdinand about his efforts on the other end of the pitch, to which he replied: “It’s really important to attack and defend as a team. I think if just one of us doesn’t defend, it makes space for the opponents and they can get through.”",
      "Providing a nine-word comment which his new boss will love, Mbeumo said: “It’s really important to defend well as a team.” He added: “Of course it’s easier to regain the ball [that way] as well.”",
      "His emphasis on defending is in stark contrast to the forwards that have played and failed under Amorim since his appointment in November. Antony, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are three members of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ this summer.",
      "They were all told to find new clubs at the start of the summer and forced to train away from the first-team. While discipline and poor form were also factors in Red Devils chiefs deciding to part ways with the players, all three, along with returning loanee Jadon Sancho, have been accused of poor defensive workrate in the past.",
      "Much of Amorim’s success at Sporting CP, where he won two league titles, was built on hard defensive graft and winning the ball back aggressively high up the pitch, with press traps leading to quick transitions to attack.",
      "That is part of the reason why the Portuguese tactician relied so heavily on Amad last season compared to some of United’s flashier forward options. The Ivorian registered more tackles, duels and recoveries than Rashford and Garnacho, while repaying Amorim’s trust by scoring 11 goals and providing 10 assists in all competitions.",
      "Under the defensive-minded Thomas Frank at Brentford, Mbeumo was certainly no slouch either. He covered more ground than any other forward in the league last season, along with providing the most crosses (202) and the most expected assists (9.3).",
      "His intention to continue working hard in both attack and defence will be music to the ears of not only Amorim but also United's fanbase, who've expressed their frustrations with the likes of Rashford for his lack of tracking back on multiple occasions in the past.",

      "“But the thing is, I don't really like to play in front of people. It’s funny, but it’s so different. Even if I play in front of a couple of friends at home, I'm not exactly shaking but it’s 'oh guys, this is kind of hard for me'.”",
      "As well as the piano, Mbeumo has developed a passion for chess and plays online anonymously, his opponents unaware they are up against a Premier League superstar. “Playing online is anonymous,” said Mbeumo. “I have a username, you choose a nickname and just play against random people online.",
      "“With chess, there is a lot of thought. When you play football, you have to think as well. Playing chess, you can see some moves ahead, because it's a strategy game. In football you have your strategy as well so you can link them together.",
      "“I’m not crazy good. But if you know the rating, I'm like 800 on chess.com. There was a period when I was really, really into it, watching videos on YouTube and doing training on the app. For the brain, it's really, really good and you can develop new skills.",
      "“Obviously you're doing football most of the time, every day, so sometimes you don't really have time to develop other skills. But I like creativity and stuff.”",
      "Mbeumo had approaches from other clubs who could offer him Champions League football next season, like Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, but chose United because of the challenge of helping to resurrect the fallen giants.",
      "“I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects,” said Mbeumo, who scored 20 league goals last season. “But the Manchester United one was very good for me.",
      "“United is a big club. It’s a great opportunity and I chose the project. I'm someone who likes a challenge. There is a very good project here and I wanted to be a part of it.",
      "“I always trust my people around me. The transfer window can be long, it can be short. So you have to be patient and just try to keep thinking positively about things.",
      "“I was obviously on my holidays, so I just wanted to think about resting mentally and physically. But I was convinced that it was going to happen.",
      "“The manager said 'we are people who like winning and we want to be the best team'. It was a very friendly conversation. He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that.",
      "“Another part as well is because you want to play on the greatest stages in the world and Old Trafford is one of them. So being able to play there every two weeks is big.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "New Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo has set himself a target of bettering his total of 20 Premier League goals last season. Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford in a deal worth up to £71million, reckons he can take his game to another level following his move to Old Trafford.",
      "United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season and versatile forward Mbeumo is confident he can provide the answer to their scoring woes. “As a striker and for myself, I always want to be better than I was yesterday,” said Mbeumo. “I’m very demanding of myself and I always try to do my best. I don’t like to put limits on myself as well.”",
      "Mbeumo can play across the front line, on the left, on the right and through the middle as a striker, and said he will play wherever United boss Ruben Amorim feels he will be most effective. “I think now, in football, you have to be adaptable and to be able to play in a few other positions than what you’d say is your best,” said Mbeumo.",
      "“I think it's really good to gain experience. Obviously I played as a winger mainly at Brentford, but I don’t have one specific position where I feel I can do the best.",
      "“But with Brentford I used to also play as a No.10 in the pocket or even as a No.9. I can play all those positions. Of course it will help me, because I’ve played in many formations before.",
      "“But obviously it's different because it's a new new time now and every season is different. But whatever position the gaffer wants to put me in, I will play there.”",
      "Mbeumo went on to confirm that he had interest from other clubs including Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham but after talking to Amorim, his mind was made up. “I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects,” said Mbeumo.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has warned that it would be \"lights out\" for the rest of the Premier League if Liverpool complete the signing of Alexander Isak. The ex-England star also eulogised over Liverpool's business this summer.",
      "Despite already securing the services of Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, the Reds maintain an active interest in 25-year-old Swedish striker Isak, with the player having informed Newcastle that he would like to explore a move away from the club.",
      "Isak is not on their pre-season tour of Asia either as speculation over a huge switch to Anfield intensifies. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, however, has confirmed they are yet to receive any formal offers for Isak, but officials at St James' Park are said to be keen on RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko as they ramp up their search for a potential replacement.",
      "While a transfer for Isak remains in a state of flux, speaking on his podcast, Rio Presents, Ferdinand waxed lyrical over the Reds' activity this summer. Despite being an icon of Liverpool's greatest rivals, Ferdinand – rather than show any bias – couldn't help show his true colours as a football pundit and relay his real belief that Isak would help secure Arne Slot a second Premier League title on the spin.",
      "\"Liverpool's transfer window has been nothing short of exceptional so far. It's been an outrageous transfer window, and if they get Isak – it's lights out for the Premier League,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"They've got a squad there, they've got a hierarchy, they look stable, they look solid. It's gone too well and if they get Isak, it's over.\"",
      "Liverpool are hunting for attacking reinforcements, particularly with Luis Diaz poised to join Bayern Munich. Slot and club chiefs believe that Isak would suit their forward line perfectly and link up well with new signing Ekitike, who joined from Eintracht Frankfurt for an initial £69 million last week.",
      "However, luring Isak away from St James' Park won't be straightforward, with the Magpies said to be demanding a whopping fee of up to £150 million to sell their prized asset, reports the Liverpool Echo. Newcastle have attributed Isak's continued absence to a minor thigh problem, having also omitted him from their squad for their pre-season clash away at Celtic.",
      "When quizzed about his star forward's future, Howe said: \"He is still our player. He's contracted to us. We, to a degree, control what is next for him.\"",
      "Liverpool's owners, Fenway Sports Group, have gone on a summer splurge, with nearly £300m spent so far. Former Red and prolific goalscorer Robbie Fowler reckons Isak would be the perfect finishing touch to a frenzied few months of activity.",
      "\"As a Liverpool fan, we would all love to see him, wouldn't we,\" Fowler told The RedMen TV. \"When you look at the Premier League and the goals he scored last year, the types of goals and his performances, he was phenomenal. Hopefully, he can carry that on, and hopefully it will be at Liverpool.",
      "\"If you were to pick one player from the Premier League last year who you would have wanted to sign for Liverpool, he would probably be on 90 per cent of people's lips. We probably needed that pivotal striker on the pitch last season. He could be the difference if he were to come.\"",

      "Rene Meulensteen believes that Conor Gallagher would be a perfect fit for Manchester United, especially given Casemiro's age. The Brazilian midfielder, who joined the Red Devils in a £70million move from Real Madrid in 2022, has shined at times at Old Trafford.",
      "However, at 33 years old, there are questions pertaining to his suitability to Ruben Amorim's demanding and fast-paced style of play, with his future in the north west being cast into question at the end of last season. Despite being linked to a move to the Saudi Pro League this summer with just a year left on his current deal in Manchester, Casemiro has ultimately decided to stay put.",
      "But Meulensteen believes that United should still be looking for a replacement ahead of his deal running down next summer, picking out Atletico Madrid star Gallagher as the ideal candidate. Speaking to Grosvenor Casinos, the former United first-team coach said: \"Conor Gallagher would bring bags of energy to Manchester United, that is something they have been lacking in the middle of the park.",
      "\"There is Manuel Ugarte there, but I don’t think he has the best legs in terms of covering distances. We don’t know what is happening with Casemiro, if he will still be part of the squad after playing more games than expected last year. I thought Gallagher was very good for Chelsea, he's a hardworking boy who covers the ground quickly, he’s tenacious, he is someone that could fit in.\"",
      "It's not the first time that United have been urged to sign the 25-year-old England international either, with Gordon Strachan also highlighting Gallagher as a suitable player at Old Trafford earlier this month. In conversation with OLBG, the 68-year-old said: \"Man United don't need a bit more bite, they need legs, real legs, real closing down.",
      "\"Can Conor Gallagher do that? Yes he can, he's definitely got legs, he's a good team-mate. Has he got enough imagination? I don't know, but if you have people like that with legs in there and have imagination around them, then he'd be a good signing.",
      "\"The days of the luxury player, if you want to be a top side, are gone. So, Conor Gallagher has definitely got the legs. He's got the robustness. Has he got goals? Has he got that flair?",
      "\"These players are hard to come by. Would I take him compared to some of the players that have played over the last couple of years at Man United? Yes, I would.\"",
      "After breaking through the youth academy of Chelsea in 2019, Gallagher spent five years with the Blues, albeit, the majority of his tenure was spent on loan with the likes of Charlton, Swansea, West Brom and Crystal Palace. A £34m move to Atletico Madrid then ensued last summer, with Gallagher thriving in La Liga with Los Rojiblancos.",
      "In his maiden season, Gallagher scored four goals and provided six assists in 50 outings and was imperative to Atleti's third-place finish in La Liga. Amorim is currently focusing on securing a proven No. 9 for United ahead of next season, with Ollie Watkins at the top of his list.",
      "While Aston Villa have said that their talisman is not for sale this summer, they valued Watkins at £60m in January, and it is thought that the Red Devils will try to broker a deal for around £45m. However, if they are unsuccessful, they may opt to continue their pursuit of 22-year-old RB Leipzig star, Benjamin Sesko, given they are thought to hold a pole position over Newcastle United in securing the striker - who is also valued at around £60m - this summer.",

      "Luke Shaw admits the Manchester United environment has been \"toxic\" in recent years and head coach Ruben Amorim will not pick players who fall short of his demands.",
      "United endured their worst season in 51 years in 2024-25 and the season ended with Amorim telling winger Alejandro Garnacho he could leave after he questioned the Portuguese's decision to bench him in the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho remains part of the 'bomb squad' that have been exiled from the first-team squad and ordered to train when their teammates are not on the premises at Carrington.",
      "Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia remain on United's books as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho and Rashford for the Manchester derby on December 15 and the latter is unlikely to play for United again. Rashford was disciplined twice by former manager Erik ten Hag, while Sancho was banished from the squad after accusing the Dutchman of lying. Shaw acknowledged there were \"no stragglers in this group any more\".",
      "\"A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative,\" Shaw said. \"It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all.",
      "\"We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. I think when you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and I think, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel like the bond is growing and growing.",
      "\"I feel like in my time here, it's probably the closest I've felt with the squad since I've been here. I think the atmosphere is really good and extremely positive. Hopefully, that can continue.",
      "\"The manager has to [take action] because at the end of the day, he's going to be the one that has his job always on the line. He wants to come in and do exactly what he wants because he's always the one who's on the end of the stick. He wants to come in and do things his own way and stamp his own authority on the club. I think that's the only way you can do it, especially at Man United.",
      "\"I think we need to just all up the level of demands. That's what I think Ruben definitely brings in, is the demands. Especially the mentality. The mentality is a big thing on his lips, really. I think he talks a lot about it. Especially in day-to-day things, with the training. Ruben demands 100% and that's it and he doesn't want anything less.",
      "\"If someone's doing 85-90%, it's not enough for him. I think, especially this year, if you're not doing the right things, I feel like you won't play.",
      "\"And he's not bothered. I think you've seen what he's done in the past eight months with different players and things like that. He doesn't care who the player is. I think if he's not following what he wants, then that's how it should be, and I think rightly so. I think whatever the manager wants, us as players we have to be delivering that. So, yes, we're fully behind that.\"",
      "Shaw, 30, gave a raw interview moments after the Europa League final defeat consigned United to only a second season without European football in 35 years where he said United players had to \"question whether they're good enough\".",
      "The left back has played 27 games in the two full seasons since he signed a four-year contract worth around £200,000-a-week and this is his 12th pre-season with United. Bruno Fernandes, who joined United five-and-a-half years after Shaw, overtook him for club appearances last term.",
      "Shaw, who has started a meagre 20 United games in two years, has no regrets about his post-match candour and admitted he had \"an awful year\".",
      "\"I wouldn't say regret, but I think straight after the game your head's hot and you just say things and you don't think about it,\" he explained. \"I think a lot of people after that final, after that year, had the feeling of you don't know how next season's going to look.",
      "\"I think we have to be open and honest about that. I think none of us were good enough. I think there always has to be that question about what we think and what our plans for the next season. I just don't really know what more to say about that.",
      "\"It's never easy losing a final, especially after the season that we went through. It was even harder to take. Like I said, I think that's why my head was a bit hotter than usual as well.",
      "\"I think I had such an awful year as well. I was just fully angry about everything. I just think that's why I did the interview and said what I said.\"",
      "Shaw joined United 11 years ago and his first few at the club were beset by injury issues and he was publicly criticised by his managers. Louis van Gaal bluntly said Shaw was \"not fit enough\" during his first pre-season in 2014 and Jose Mourinho despaired at how immature Shaw conducted himself.",
      "After Shaw was late for training once, he innocently told staff that his mother had overslept and not woken him up in time. Now Shaw is preaching the importance of punctual timekeeping.",
      "\"I think us as players, especially the more experienced ones, we need to be demanding more from a day-in, day-out basis,\" he added. \"The levels in training, keeping the times of when we're doing this and doing that, making sure no one's coming late or anything.\"",

Ruben Amorim will be pleased with his side's first outing of the tour and will be looking to build on that display against Bournemouth.",
      "Amorim could look to make changes against Bournemouth but Altay Bayindir is likely to start in goal with Andre Onana still recovering from injury. United's first-choice back three is still undecided, but there's every chance it could be Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven. The trio have never played as a back three but they could start against the Cherries.",
      "Diogo Dalot played 25 minutes against West Ham so could be given a start to help him build up his fitness, while Manuel Ugarte was excellent against the Hammers and deserves to start. Kobbie Mainoo could start alongside him after his excellent display last weekend, but a dilemma further up the pitch could mean Amorim drops Bruno Fernandes back into midfield to allow others a chance to stake their claim to be one of the two No.10s.",
      "Patrick Dorgu can start on the left, with Amad and Matheus Cunha playing as the No.10s. Amad started at right wing-back against West Ham and there's a chance that could be his settled position moving forward. With Bryan Mbeumo potentially set to feature against Everton, this could be Amad's chance to show why he should be starting behind the striker.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund endured a torrid second season at Old Trafford and needs to make a point in pre-season. He looked sharp in the early stages against West Ham and should be given another chance against Bournemouth.",
      "Predicted XI: Bayindir; Yoro, Maguire, Heaven; Dalot, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Amad, Cunha; Hojlund",

      "Over the weekend, Antony's agent Junior Pedroso discussed his future and said: \"What I can say is that the player is on the market, and there are several clubs that want to know his current status. We listen to the projects and analyse them. But he is open to moving to Saudi Arabia. Anything is possible.\"",
      "Antony's return to Manchester United training was delayed at the beginning of July so he could explore a move away, and he was subsequently not included in the USA tour squad.",
      "The winger is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and must be sold for £32.8million for United to avoid making a PSR loss, which feels like a reasonable fee after his Real Betis loan.",
      "Antony was a disaster in a United shirt, but he looked like a different player for Betis last season, scoring nine goals and playing a key role as they reached the Conference League final.",
      "He found a new lease of life in Spain and is consequently a more attractive proposition this summer. Antony was on a downward spiral at United and has managed to arrest his slump.",
      "However, when analysing the market, there may be just a handful of options for Antony in Europe. The clubs that would love to sign Antony cannot afford £32.8m. And the clubs that could afford the fee - the elite sides in Europe - aren't interested in him.",
      "Most European football clubs are in a financial pickle. Betis want to sign Antony permanently, for example, but they would have to break their transfer record to do so.",
      "So it was not surprising to see Antony's agent confirm that his client would be open to a move to Saudi Arabia, a transfer market United have underutilised.",
      "Saudi Arabia are diversifying their economy to reduce their dependence on oil and sport has been targeted. The Saudis have pumped millions into boxing and Saudi Pro League clubs have spent well over £1billion on transfers over the last few years.",
      "There have been accusations of sportswashing, of course, but Premier League clubs have cashed in, selling players to Saudi teams for the type of transfer fees that European clubs can't match.",
      "Kalidou Koulibaly, N'Golo Kante, Ruben Neves, Fabinho and Aleksandar Mitrovic are just some of the names who have moved to the Kingdom in multi-million transfers from Premier League sides.",
      "But United haven't taken advantage of selling to Saudi clubs like some of their rivals. Their only sale to the region was Alex Telles to Al Nassr for around £4m in the summer of 2023.",
      "Al-Hilal were prepared to make a huge offer to sign Bruno Fernandes this summer, but United wanted to keep the 30-year-old, who decided to continue in the Premier League.",
      "It's easier said than done, but United would ideally sell players to Saudi Arabia on their terms. Those opportunities are hard to come by, but Antony is the perfect candidate to ship out to the Kingdom for a decent fee.",
      "Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester City have all benefited from the Saudi gravy train in the last few years, and it's about time United exported a player to that market for a multi-million fee.",
      "United have famously not been great sellers in the transfer market and that must change with Ineos in charge of football operations. Building relations with club chiefs in Saudi Arabia wouldn't be a bad place to start.",
      "Antony is a sellable asset after his Betis loan and Saudi Arabia could be his next destination.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer news live blog on Wednesday, 30 July.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is also under consideration and keen to secure a major move this summer. The striker rejected United three years ago in favour of joining RB Leipzig; however, his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has remained in dialogue with the club, visiting their Carrington training complex and Old Trafford since holding talks about a possible move in 2022.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho are three players the club still aim to move on. Al-Nassr. United are said to have explored including the former in deals to sign Nicolas Jackson and Watkins from Chelsea or Villa, respectively.",

      "Brandon Williams featured for Hull City in their pre-season friendly against Sunderland on Tuesday night.",
      "Williams, 24, left United last summer when his contract expired, but has yet to sign for a new club. Hull, however, have now taken the player on trial, training with the team before coming on as a second-half substitute for the final 20 minutes of their latest friendly.",

      "A lot of players want to be near the big cities. They want to be near Manchester, they want to be in London, and their families want to be there.",
      "You're fighting, geographically, if you are up in Newcastle, and that's just the nature of a footballer's mentality, I'm afraid. They might be drawn to whether they have friends at other clubs as well, or friends of their wives and families are a big part of that.",

      "Opponents Newport County went on to win the tie 4-2 on penalties to make it to the first round proper where they will face Championship club Millwall.",
      "According to Tuttomercato, Fiorentina defender Pietro Comuzzo is on the radar of United and their Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest and Sunderland.",
      "The 20-year-old centre-back made 33 appearances in Serie A last season and his new head coach Stefano Pioli holds him in high regard.",
      "United will be able to take a closer look at Comuzzo next month when Fiorentina are welcomed to Old Trafford for a pre-season fixture.",
      "There are a number of reasons why Garnacho must leave this summer, not least the fact that he has requested his departure.",

      "Now Rashford has gone on loan, United cannot afford to do the same with Garnacho - their only other asset.",
      "That being said, £30m appears to be a measly sum and the Reds will hope that they can negotiate a higher price with the Blues or elsewhere.",
      "According to The Independent, United have spoken to Chelsea and Aston Villa about the prospect of swapping Garnacho for Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins respectively.",
      "It is believed that while Chelsea value Jackson at £80m, they are unwilling to pay more than £30m for Garnacho.",

      "Speaking to the media for the first time since arriving at United, Mbeumo has shed light on what Amorim told him about the club which convinced him to sign.",
      "Of course, I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects but the Manchester United one was very good for me. He (Amorim) said ‘we are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team’, and of course that's what we will try to do.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "The Sun reports this week that Nottingham Forest have won the race to sign Bologna winger Dan Ndoye this summer.",

      "It is believed the Serie A giants have been battling Forest hard for Ndoye and should he be taken off the table, Garnacho or Manchester City's Jack Grealish could be an option again.",
      "That is according to Fabrizio Romano anyway.",
      "He understands that Garnacho is still a certainty to leave United this summer despite Amorim suggesting last week that those who have requested their exits are not automatically guaranteed to leave.",
      "Romano adds that Chelsea could move to bring the United man to Stamford Bridge later in this window.",
      "When his transfer back to the Premier League is reportedly planned for next summer, it is hard to say whether United should touch this deal or not.",
      "He will be at least 33 when he arrives back in England and on the face of it, that is not the sort of signing which Ineos would advocate.",
      "However, could Kane be like Robert Lewandowski who, at 36, managed to score 42 goals in all competitions last season for Barcelona.",
      "If Kane has a season as good as 2024/25 this year, he would be a tempting prospect even for Ineos' staunch recruitment team.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Harry Kane could be at the beginning of the end of his time at Bayern Munich.",
      "Having won the Bundesliga last season and scoring a respectable 85 goals in 96 appearances so far for the Bavarian club, Kane has his eyes set on a return to the Premier League.",
      "It is believed that following the World Cup in the US next summer, the 32-year-old could push for a move back to England with Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League goalscoring record in his sights.",
      "Currently, Kane is just 47 goals behind Shearer and realistically he would need to play another two seasons in the top flight to overcome the Newcastle legend's tally.",

      "L'Equipe have claimed that United are due 50% of the profit of any sale made by Marseille. \"Bascially, if OM sells him for €50m, they will have bought hi.m... for €50m and will have recovered €25m,\" a source has said via Sport Witness.",
      "Former Man United coach Rene Meulensteen has tipped Ruben Amorim to launch a raid on Arsenal to sign Ethan Nwaneri.",
      "Nwaneri is expected to sign a new deal in London but Meulensteen hasn't ruled out the possibility of United offering him a move. Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi have both left north London for Old Trafford.",
      "\"Ayden Heaven looks to be an astute bit of business and it’s interesting that there is a pathway of players moving from Arsenal to Manchester United with Chido Obi another one,\" Meulensteen told Grosvenor Casino.",
      "\"These players have had a good education and for whatever reason they didn’t see a way forward at their particular club, United acted swiftly and we’ve seen them do well.",
      "\"Ethan Nwaneri could be another one, it’s interesting that other Arsenal players have been keen on United. What I would say on Nwaneri, I think there will be a bit more of a tug-of-war going on and more financial demands than with those two.\"",
      "Man United are currently the 'most likely destination' for Harry Kane if he was to leave Bayern Munich next year.",
      "It's widely reported that Kane could leave the German side next summer after the World Cup 2026. There is a clause in his contract that decreases each year and insiders in Germany have claimed a move may occur next summer.",

      "Man United have reportedly joined the race to sign Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze and have established initial contacts.",

      "Barcelona have sent a message to Marcus Rashford after the Manchester United forward made his debut for the Catalan giants at the weekend.",
      "The La Liga champions will be footing the bill for Rashford's wages during his stint at Camp Nou, which is estimated to save United around £12million. Barca also have the option to make his move to Catalonia permanent.",
      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season earlier this month and stripped him of his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he now has his dream transfer to Barcelona after spending the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",

After splashing out on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window, United will need to offload players to fund further purchases.",
      "And the Reds have identified Aston Villa's Watkins as their preferred target but the 22-year-old RB Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window."

      "One of the most infamous transfer unveilings is of Alexis Sanchez playing 'Glory glory Man United' on the piano. Bryan Mbeumo is a self-taught pianist.",
      "Mbeumo will play in front of more than 70,000 at Old Trafford next month yet he is loath to tickle the ivories in the presence of others. \"The thing is, I don't really like to play in front of people,\" he admits.",
      "So you can play football in front of nearly 80,000 fans but can't play the piano for friends? \"It’s funny, but it’s so different. Even if I play in front of a couple of friends at home, I'm not exactly shaking but it’s ‘oh guys, this is kind of hard for me’.",
      "Mbeumo is holding court on the first floor of Manchester United's hotel in Chicago, the Waldorf Astoria. Wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, he is clutching a bottle of water that he takes regular sips from during the 13-minute interview.",
      "At the Chicago Fire's Endeavor Health Performance Center earlier that morning, Mbeumo felt the heat. The 25-year-old has been doing extra sprints in recent days, attacking with the ball and then embarking on a recovery sprint into his own third. He also worked up a sweat in the hour-long on-pitch post-match session at the MetLife on Saturday night.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has suggested Mbeumo will play no part against Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday evening but could feature against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. Mbeumo is aiming to be match-fit for the opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Mbeumo is playing catch-up as Brentford started pre-season training a week after United. Mbeumo reported on day one but it is understood he only did gym work to avoid the risk of injury amid his desire to join United.",
      "Mbeumo's fitness would be more advanced but for his £71million protracted transfer. He spoke to the managers from two other clubs (presumably Thomas Frank at Tottenham Hotspur and Eddie Howe at Newcastle) but was set on United.",
      "\"Manchester is a big club. I think it’s a great opportunity and I chose the project,\" he explains. \"I think I'm someone who likes a challenge. There is a very good project in Manchester and I wanted to be part of it.",
      "\"Of course, I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects but the Manchester United one was very good for me. He (Amorim) said ‘we are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team’, and of course that's what we will try to do.",
      "\"I think it was a very friendly conversation and a constructive one. He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that.",
      "\"You want to play on the greatest stages in the world. And Old Trafford is one of them. So being able to play here every two weeks is just big.\"",
      "United were unhappy with Brentford's conduct during negotiations, accusing them of attempting to railroad Mbeumo into joining Spurs or Newcastle and to reduce his salary expectations. Brentford tell a different side to the story.",
      "Despite the posturing, the deal was always heading in the right direction even after Brentford rejected United's first two offers.",
      "\"I always trust my people around me,\" Mbeumo stresses. \"The transfer windows can be long, it can be short. So you have to be patient, and just try to keep thinking positively about things.",
      "\"I was obviously on my holidays, so I just wanted to think about resting mentally and physically and if it was going to happen, it was going to happen. I trust my people and I was convinced that it was going to happen.\"",
      "Mbeumo's role in Amorim's new XI has generated enough speculation to rival a transfer. He is a winger yet was the joint-fourth highest scorer in the Premier League last season, so one of the two playmaker roles could be his. He also refers to himself as a \"striker\".",
      "So where will he play? \"Not one specific position because I think now, in football, you have to be adaptable and be able to play in a few other positions than what you’d say is your best. But I think it's really good to gain experience.",
      "\"Obviously I’ve played as a winger mainly at Brentford but I don’t have one specific position where I feel I can do the best. But with Brentford I used to also play as a 10 in the pocket or even as a No 9. I can do all those positions.",
      "\"Of course, as a forward, as a striker, you always want to make an imprint in the game, helping people to score or scoring yourself. So I think this is something really important for me.\"",
      "Tallying 20 league goals for Brentford was a monumental achievement. Half that tally would be a respectable return for Mbeumo in his maiden season at United but he is refusing to rein in expectations.",
      "\"As a striker as well, for myself I always want to be better than I was yesterday,\" he says. \"I’m very demanding of myself and I always try to do the best. I don’t like to put limits on myself as well.\"",
      "Could he operate as the lone striker? \"Whatever position the gaffer wants to put me out, I will play there.\"",
      "A lone king, perhaps. As well as a pianist, Mbeumo is also a chess fanatic. \"Chess, even if it's not physical, there is a lot of thought. When you play football you have to think as well. Playing chess you can see some moves ahead because it is a strategy game. In football you have your strategy as well so you can link them together.\"",
      "How good is he? \"I’m not that crazy good. But if you know the rating, I'm like 800 on chess.com. Playing online is anonymous. I have a user name, you choose a nickname and just play against random people online. And I use my own chess board against them.",
      "\"There was a period where I was really, really into it. I was watching videos on YouTube doing training on the app. I think even for the brain, it's really, really good. And you can develop new skills.",
      "\"Obviously, you're doing football most of the time, every day, so you sometimes don't really have time to develop other skills. I like creativity and stuff.",
      "\"I watched The Queen’s Gambit (on Netflix). It was really good. I’ve not watched the Magnus Carlsen thing yet. Maybe I should. I’ve been told that Josh (Zirkzee) plays, so I might need to play against him and bring in the chess board.\"",
      "Mbeumo could have an audience for that, if not the piano-playing. He is still likely to play more fluently than Sanchez.",

      "Manchester United are facing heavy losses in the transfer window as they attempt to offload players who wish to leave the club this summer. Manager Ruben Amorim had excluded five first-team stars from his pre-season plans, including Marcus Rashford who has since joined Barcelona, after being informed that Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia also intend to leave.",
      "The potential income from selling these squad members could enhance United's transfer strategy. However, it's reported that the Red Devils have reduced several of their player valuations since the opening of the transfer window, news that will not be welcomed by United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Rashford has finalised his season-long loan move to Barcelona, who have an option to make his stay at Camp Nou permanent for £26million. This figure is a significant decrease from United's reported £100m valuation last year, according to the Mirror, and even less than the £40m price quoted to Aston Villa.",
      "Yet, the £74m reduction in Rashford's previous valuation is only a portion of the total £213m United could lose as they strive to part ways with their unsettled players.",
      "Garnacho is another player whose value has significantly decreased since the beginning of the summer. The Argentine winger, previously linked with Chelsea and Napoli, was initially valued at £70m.",
      "However, the Mirror has reported that United have nearly halved their asking price to £40m. This represents a £30m shortfall on what United were anticipating to receive from the sale of the talented 21-year-old, who netted 11 goals across all competitions last season.",
      "Garnacho's disappointment at being benched for the Europa League final last season was evident. \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" he said. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Antony's successful loan stint at Real Betis last season likely raised United's hopes of recovering a substantial part of the £82m they paid Ajax three years ago. United set a price tag of around £40m for Betis to make the winger's move permanent after he netted nine goals and provided five assists in 26 outings.",
      "Betis found the asking price too steep, yet Antony's market value has stayed close to that figure, which would result in United facing a significant loss of £42m on the Brazilian.",
      "Sancho was another player who came to United with high expectations following his impressive performances at Borussia Dortmund, costing the Red Devils £73m in 2021. Despite his high-profile transfer, Sancho did not manage to deliver similar success at Old Trafford and a clash with former manager Erik ten Hag led to his exclusion from the team in 2023.",
      "After a brief return to Dortmund and a loan period at Chelsea, no permanent deal materialised. Reports in Italy have claimed that Juventus have agreed a £15m move for Sancho, who is entering the last year of his contract, a sum significantly that is £58m lower than his initial transfer fee.",
      "Left-back Malacia has struggled with injuries since joining United for £13m from Feyenoord in 2022. After a loan spell at PSV Eindhoven last season, which didn't lead to a permanent move, United need to recoup £3.22m to avoid a loss under PSR regulations, which would be around £9m below his original cost.",
      "Despite potential financial losses in the transfer market, United manager Amorim has expressed his willingness to reintegrate the players should no deals materialise. \"There are different reasons for the players [left behind],\" he explained.",
      "\"Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams. We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide. If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact, these people, Jason [Wilcox, technical director], Omar [Berrada, chief executive] and the club have a number for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.",
      "\"I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I'm ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition if you want to play in the World Cup next year, so you need to play. I'm really happy with that because I have more options. If they have to fight each other to play one game a week, for me it's perfect.\"",

      "Two strikers remain on Manchester United's radar in the summer transfer window.",
      "Sources have indicated the search has been whittled down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, with the former United's preferred option.",
      "Watkins is a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. He has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024.",
      "Watkins and Sesko have very different profiles, so it will be fascinating to see which player is signed.",
      "Sesko has not played in the Premier League and there is no guarantee he could make the transition from RB Leipzig to United, which is another reason to lean towards Watkins.",
      "However, Sesko has established himself as one of the finest goalscoring prospects in Europe and his ceiling is high, while Watkins has already maximised his potential as he approaches his 30th birthday.",
      "Sesko could prove to be better value for money in the long term and RB Leipzig would allow him to leave for a bid in the region of £69million to £78m, which is a reasonable valuation.",
      "The 22-year-old could develop into a world-class forward and he's been on United's radar for a few years. His agent, Elvis Basanovic, even visited Carrington and Old Trafford during talks over a possible move in 2022.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago as he opted for a move to RB Leipzig, where has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances, but the player has earmarked this summer as a chance for a big move.",
      "There is a degree of risk involved with Sesko that does not come with Watkins. Would he adapt to the demands of the Premier League? Would he settle quickly in England? How many seasons would it take him to score consistently? These are the types of questions United decision-makers will be asking.",
      "Sesko's goalscoring record in the Bundesliga is similar to Watkins' in the Premier League, but the German top flight is not as competitive and he is still raw, which must be considered.",
      "United scored a measly 44 goals in the league last season and it's logical to sign a striker who is proven in the division. Watkins would be a relatively short-term fix, but he would be effective and Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from playing second fiddle to a forward with such nous.",
      "So, would Aston Villa be happy to sanction a move for Watkins? United sources concede a sizeable bid would be required, but reports in the Midlands have claimed Watkins is not for sale. Who would lead their attack if Watkins was sold? Villa opted against signing Marcus Rashford permanently and Jhon Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the winter transfer window.",
      "It would be a bold move to sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows.",
      "Villa are now one of United's rivals due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Emery's side would probably be better off sticking with what they have this summer, which raises the possibility of United leaning towards Sesko.",

      "Whisper it quietly, but this might finally be the season Manchester United finally see the best of Mason Mount in a red shirt.",
      "When United signed the England international midfielder from Chelsea in a deal worth up to £60million two years ago it was seen as a major coup to get one of their rivals' biggest talents.",
      "One of Mount's greatest abilities was his availability and managers ranging from Thomas Tuchel to Gareth Southgate to Frank Lampard all hailed him as a coach's dream.",
      "Erik ten Hag thought he was going to get the same feeling but, ironically, since joining United, his lack of availability has been a major problem. A number of unfortunate injuries have restricted Mount to just 30 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in Manchester.",
      "However, he ended last season strongly and scored twice in United's 4-1 Europa League semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao and played a prominent role in the side.",
      "Speaking back in March, United boss Ruben Amorim described why he 'really loved' Mount and why his version of United needed a player like him in the team.",
      "\"I really love Mason Mount,\" he said. \"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "\"You saw players who had a lot of problems in time but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Mount was signed as a deeper midfield option by Ten Hag but always thrived in a more advanced role at Chelsea. That is where Amorim sees him playing for United, too, but he will have fierce competition this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can play in that role while new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, have been brought in to play in that position.",
      "Mount has a fight on his hands but it is one he seems up for and insists he has ensured he's returned to pre-season feeling as strong as possible.",
      "\"I look at the end of last season and that was positive for me, to get back in the shape that I was in and be able to play and finish the end of the season off, to get a few goals, and to be back in and amongst the lads. That's the most important thing,\" he said.",
      "\"We're all in this together, and I think this period now is so important for us to spend together to train. But yeah, personally, I'm feeling really good. I feel like I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm so excited for the start of the season.\"",
      "So far, Mount's body has held up in pre-season, having come off the bench in the draw with Leeds and the win over West Ham.",
      "With games against Bournemouth and Everton to come in the USA this week, the 26-year-old will be keen to make his mark ahead of what is a make-or-break season for him in the eyes of United fans.",
      "Amorim's system and support should get the best out of Mount. It is now time for him to deliver what United fans have waited two years to see.",

      "Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo are the only senior players to have been added to the Reds squad this close season. There were question marks as to whether Leon would be integrated in the senior squad after his first move to European football but the full-back has excelled in training and youngster Harry Amass will instead be loaned out.",
      "Despite the deals done already, United will be keen to add further strength to their squad this summer. As such, MEN Sport has continued its daily look at some of the top rumours surrounding the club.",
      "Writing in his GiveMeSport column, journalist Fabrizio Romano has shed light on the rumours linking United with a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma. According to him, the Reds have not made any contact with the Italian at this stage.",
      "However, Romano understands that United do want a new goalkeeper but the 'numbers' need to be right.",
      "What MEN Sport says: We understand that there is currently no set budget available for a new first choice goalkeeper at Old Trafford which perhaps explains the lack of concrete interest from United for Donnarumma. Reports that United are not willing to pay £40m for Emi Martinez perhaps show evidence of a more sensible approach to transfer business. All this does make you wonder why United are not looking at bringing Aaron Ramsdale in on loan to provide good competition for Andre Onana.",
      "While this would not be a transfer for 2025, The Telegraph claims that Harry Kane is eyeing a return to the Premier League in 2026. United were interested in him back in 2023 when he moved to Bayern Munich but could not negotiate a deal with Tottenham.",
      "Kane is most likely eyeing Alan Shearer's record of 260 Premier League goals and a move closer to family as he turns 33 next year. It remains to be seen if United return to their interest in the striker.",
      "What MEN Sport says: On the surface, this is a signing that Ineos would not want any part of. An ageing player with no re-sale value.",
      "But, a player who Kane is often compared to is Robert Lewandowski and the Pole is still going strong at the age of 36 in La Liga. On a three-year deal, could Kane continue his lethal goalscoring prowess?",
      "That remains to be seen. But there is no doubting that he remains one of the best lone strikers in the world and would suit Ruben Amorim's system perfectly.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is set to outshine the outgoing talent at Manchester United, having emphasised the significance of his defensive contributions.",
      "Last week, United confirmed the signing of Mbeumo from Brentford in a transfer that could total £71million. The 25-year-old represents an electrifying boost to Ruben Amorim's squad, which was goal-shy last term.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals for the Bees in the previous season, demonstrating his knack for scoring. His remarkable speed promises to inject a fresh element into the Red Devils' forward line.",
      "However, it was during his appearance on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast that the Cameroonian international drew attention to another aspect of his game that likely influenced Amorim's eagerness to secure his services this summer: his commendable defensive efforts.",
      "When quizzed by United icon Ferdinand about his contributions to defence, Mbeumo responded: \"It's really important to attack and defend as a team.",
      "\"I think if just one of us doesn't defend, it makes space for the opponents and they can get through. It's really important to defend well as a team. Of course, it's easier to regain the ball [that way] as well.\"",
      "His focus on defence is a marked departure from the forwards who have struggled under Amorim since his appointment in November. Antony, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are three members of United's so-called 'bomb squad' this summer, reports the Mirror.",
      "They were all instructed to seek new clubs at the start of the summer and made to train separately from the first team, with Rashford leaving for Barcelona last week on a season-long loan deal.",
      "While discipline issues and poor form also played a part in the decision by United's management to let these players go, all three, along with returning loanee Jadon Sancho, have been criticised for their lacklustre defensive efforts in the past.",
      "Much of Amorim's success at Sporting CP, where he clinched two league titles, was built on solid defensive work and aggressive ball recovery high up the pitch, with press traps leading to swift transitions to attack.",
      "This is partly why the Portuguese coach relied so heavily on Amad last season compared to some of United's more flamboyant forward options. The Ivorian recorded more tackles, duels and recoveries than Rashford and Garnacho, while rewarding Amorim's faith by netting 11 goals and providing 10 assists in all competitions.",
      "Under the defensively-minded Thomas Frank at Brentford, Mbeumo was certainly no slouch either. He covered more ground than any other forward in the league last season, as well as delivering the most crosses (202) and the most expected assists (9.3).",
      "His commitment to exerting effort in both attack and defence will be a welcome sound not only to Amorim but also to United's supporters, who have previously voiced their dissatisfaction with players such as Rashford for his perceived lack of defensive contribution.",

      "Manchester United are edging closer to the start of another Premier League season and the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "In an ideal world, clubs across the land would have completed their business before the serious stuff begins. But, for many football clubs, the ideal world does not exist.",
      "Even Liverpool and Arsenal, who have perhaps had the most impressive summer windows, might still be forced to go down to the wire to complete deals. So if that is the case for them, the same almost certainly applies to United.",
      "Ruben Amorim would have wanted players who expressed their desire to leave the club out in quick-fashion to help fund his business. Yet so far, only Marcus Rashford has managed to depart Old Trafford - and there are still a quartet of want-aways stuck in Manchester.",
      "To successfully sign either striker, United would need to spend between £60-70million, which is money they can't splash without a big sale. Departing with Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Jadon Sancho would provide some relief from the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) which is proving to be the bane of United's summer.",
      "However, bagging at least £50million for Alejandro Garnacho would be a huge boost to their PSR position, as well as being the catalyst for a striker signing that they desperately need. Garnacho, as we are all familiar with now, was bought for a nominal fee so when he is sold, the money collected will effectively be 'pure profit'.",
      "This is looked down upon favourably by PSR and now that Rashford has left on loan, Garnacho represents the last opportunity for United to cash in a healthy profit considering Malacia, Antony and Sancho would all leave for a measly amortisation profit - which would not benefit the club as significantly in their pursuit of Watkins or Sesko.",

      "Manchester United have been active in the loan market during the summer window.",
      "United have sent eight players on loan and Jonny Evans has been involved in some of the deals, having been appointed head of loans and pathways after retiring from his playing career.",
      "Evans now has the responsibility of arranging loans for academy youngsters and working closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first team'.",
      "The wheels were already in motion for some loan deals before the appointment of Evans, but he started work at the end of June and has contributed to a few moves.",
      "Here is a closer look at the loan departures so far from United this summer...",
      "After signing from Le Havre, Enzo Kana-Biyik immediately joined FC Lausanne-Sport on loan. The young striker has joined Ineos-owned Lausanne for regular game time this season, although he is said to have suffered a minor injury in training shortly after arriving in Switzerland.",
      "United signed Kana-Biyik on a free transfer because they believe he possesses first team potential. The 18-year-old has followed in the footsteps of Paul Pogba, who also joined United as a teenager from Le Havre.",
      "Sonny Aljofree spent last season on loan with Accrington Stanley, where he made 27 appearances, and United moved swiftly to arrange another loan for the youngster in 2025/26.",
      "Notts County finished sixth in League Two last season and Accrington finished in 21st.",
      "Aljofree impressed Notts County during his time with Accrington, who narrowly avoided relegation to the National League, and he will look to develop further at Meadow Lane.",
      "Earlier this month, defender Habeeb Ogunneye joined Newport County on a season-long loan.",
      "Newport boss David Hughes knows Ogunnye well, having worked closely with the youngster during his time as assistant manager of United's U21s, and was the driving force behind the deal.",
      "Dan Gore deserves some luck during his second loan with Rotherham after dealing with a handful of unfortunate injuries, which have disrupted his progress in the last two years.",
      "Gore suffered a foot injury shortly after signing for Rotherham in January and he recovered at Carrington. United planned for Gore to play for the Under-21s against West Ham for fitness in May, but Rotherham boss Matt Hamshaw wanted to start him in their final game of the season.",
      "Rotherham rate Gore highly, despite the youngster's limited time with the Millers during his loan last season, and it would be great to see him make up for lost time in the new campaign.",
      "Joe Hugill's loan with Carlisle didn't go as planned last season. Hugill scored just twice during his six months in Cumbria and Carlisle were relegated to the National League after a 20-year stay in the EFL.",
      "Hugill has now been sent to Barnet, who gained promotion to League Two last term.",
      "Elyh Harrison spent the first half of last season on loan with Chester. The youngster started every league game for Chester and kept seven clean sheets in 18 starts before being recalled to Carrington in January.",
      "United recalled Harrison to provide goalkeeping cover for the U21s and spend time in first-team training. Ruben Amorim subsequently named Harrison in eight matchday squads.",
      "The promising young goalkeeper has been sent to Shrewsbury Town this season. Joe Hart and Dean Henderson began their careers with Shrewsbury and Harrison has the potential to reach the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford is the outlier because he is a senior player with a wealth of experience, but Barcelona have the option to sign Rashford permanently at the end of the season.",
      "Barcelona will cover Rashford's wages, which is estimated to save United around £12million.",
      "Rashford's relationship with Amorim became frosty in December when he was dropped for the Manchester derby, and arranging his exit was a priority for United in the summer window.",
      "Radek Vitek is another exciting goalkeeping prospect. Vitek has joined Bristol City on loan for the new season, and it's always a good indicator when United arrange a loan for a young player in the Championship.",
      "The Championship is an unforgiving division and this season will be a great challenge for Vitek, who impressed during his previous loan stints with Blau-Weiß Linz and Accrington Stanley.",
      "The 21-year-old looked sharp in pre-season with United last summer and has plenty of potential.",

Collyer made his first appearance for United in the Community Shield against Manchester City last year, but has only been in the starting line-up three times since then.",
      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders at the disposal of head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is anticipated that United's plan to arrange a loan move for Collyer will pave the way for a new midfield signing.",
      "Having joined the United academy from Brighton in 2022, Collyer signed a new contract last summer. However, he was sidelined for 28 matches due to three separate injuries last season, managing to make only 13 appearances.",
      "This week has seen the Reds being linked with Sporting's Morten Hjulmand, with the Dane a key part of the Portuguese club's success under Amorim. But former goalkeeper Howard believes one of United's current midfielders, Collyer, could still enjoy success at M16.",
      "“I’m interested in how Collyer fits in here,” he said on NBC Sports.",
      "“They think so highly of him as a central midfield player. He gets attracted to the ball, he likes to be on the ball.",
      "“Does he have enough to play at this level? I think he does, but it’s going to be about time and opportunity, really.”",
      "“I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,” he said. “I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan.",

      "“Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay. I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "“I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.”",

      "\"Obviously the manager knows what he's doing. He's got his reason for doing things. Obviously last season, like I said previously, I had quite a few injuries so he could be looking at it that he doesn't want to overcook me in a way like that. So the manager knows what he's doing.\"",

      "Juan Sebastian Veron has confessed he regrets his transfer from Manchester United to Chelsea, blaming injuries for his struggles at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Few Premier League stars have made the leap from one major title contender to another, with a notable case being Carlos Tevez's controversial switch across Manchester to neighbours City. Veron represents one of those players who defected to a significant rival, when he departed United for Stamford Bridge in 2003 following just two seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-50-year old originally joined United for a British transfer record sum of £28.1million, netting 11 times in 82 outings and claiming one Premier League crown.",
      "Following his arrival, Sir Alex Ferguson declared: \"I never thought I'd spend this much money on a footballer. I think he's coming into great years of his career and he will peak and we'll get the benefit of that. He is a world-class, fantastic footballer with a vision of a game we can use.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Veron had just 24 months under Ferguson's stewardship before becoming one of Roman Abramovich's initial acquisitions as Chelsea's owner. He departed United for £15m, meaning the club sustained a loss of approximately £13m from their initial transfer outlay.",
      "When reflecting on his stint at Stamford Bridge in 2019, the Argentine revealed: \"At Chelsea, the reality is that I had very little time. I had a major back injury and I was out for practically six months. I was already thinking more about going back to Italy than staying there in England.\"",
      "The move to Chelsea proved to be one he'd come to rue, as he struggled for playing time at Stamford Bridge, managing just 14 appearances and netting only once. He was loaned out to Inter Milan and Club Estudiantes de La Plata before taking a sabbatical for a year and remaining at La Plata until hanging up his boots in 2017.",
      "Discussing his regret over the Chelsea transfer, Veron admitted: \"With United, the truth is that there are few things, very few, that I regret. But one is to have left Manchester. They never pushed me or told me 'you have to go', but they gave me the chance, the possibility.",
      "\"I had talks with my former colleagues at that time telling me that I had to stay. And at one moment I decided to leave because I wanted to play, because I didn't know... I should have stayed.\"",
      "Reports this summer have linked Chelsea with a move for current United winger Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine is expected to leave Old Trafford in the current transfer window with the Blues one of the clubs showing an interest in his services.",
      "Fellow winger Jadon Sancho made the same move last summer, signing a loan deal with Chelsea. He made a total of 42 appearances last season, but like Veron, it was a move that didn't work out and the Blues opted against using the obligation to buy, instead paying a fee to send him back to United.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Garnacho will follow in Veron's footsteps, but his warning should be somethingthe Argentinian considers this summer.",

His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",

This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",

      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",

After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",

      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) James Trafford – £27m/€31.2m (Burnley to Manchester City, July 2025)\nBurnley are claiming that they have sold Trafford for a British record fee for a goalkeeper but City sources place the deal at £27m plus add-ons. Newcastle were willing to pay that sum but, not for the first time, their lure was far less than City’s.",
      "",
      "12) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "13) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "14) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "15) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "16) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "17) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "18) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "19) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "20) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",

      "Manchester United have received a blow in their desire to offload Antony, though there is fresh interest in another expensive flop, according to reports.",
      "Antony has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in recent days after a fruitful six-month loan at Real Betis.",
      "The Brazilian winger joined United from Ajax for around £85million in August 2022 and has failed to live up to the hefty price tag. However, his form during the second half of last season has raised the player’s value ahead of a summer sale.",
      "Betis want to keep Antony but are struggling to match the 25-year-old’s wage demands. He currently earns £105,000 a week at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils have so far failed in their attempts to shift all of their unwanted high earners, with the exception of new Barcelona loan signing Marcus Rashford.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all surplus to requirements, with Ruben Amorim eager to move them on and reinvest in new signings.",
      "The club have signed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £127.5m but Amorim wants a new centre-forward, and potentially a midfielder and goalkeeper — though the latter is contingent on Andre Onana leaving.",
      "It was reported by Foot Mercato on Monday that Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr — captained by United legend Cristiano Ronaldo — have made an opening offer for Antony.",
      "Meanwhile, a fresh report from Antenados states that Antony has ‘rejected’ offers from Brazilian clubs Sao Paulo and Botafogo.",
      "Indeed, the former Ajax forward has ‘ruled out’ a return to his homeland in the summer transfer window.",
      "It’s confirmed that Antony ‘is not in United’s plans next season’ but Sao Paulo ‘demonstrating interest’ will not sway him, with the Serie A side receiving a ‘negative result’.",
      "It’s added that clubs in the Middle East are interested but there’s no mention of the aforementioned Al Nassr ‘offer’.",
      "Another player who could leave United this summer is Rasmus Hojlund, who is not a part of Amorim’s bomb squad alongside Antony, Sancho, Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Hojlund joined the Premier League giants from Atalanta in the 2023 summer window and has been strongly linked with a return to the Italian Serie A in recent months.",
      "According to Italian outlet Calciomercato, Hojlund’s former Atalanta head coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, is keen on reuniting at AS Roma, who the veteran boss took charge of at the end of 2024/25.",
      "The report claims that Artem Dovbyk’s uncertain future could open the door for the arrival of the 22-year-old Danish international.",
      "Calciomercato states:",
      "In the event of a Dovbyk transfer, Roma would attempt to bring Rasmus Hojlund back to Italy. The 2003-born Danish striker has a contract with Manchester United until June 2028 (plus an option for another season) worth €3 million net per year.",
      "His name had also been linked on the market with other Italian clubs such as Inter (before the explosion of Pio Esposito, the arrival of Bonny from Parma and the negotiations for Lookman from Atalanta), Napoli (before the arrival of Lucca from Udinese), Juventus (as an alternative to Kolo Muani and Darwin Nunez) and Milan (as an alternative to Vlahovic).",
      "Hojlund has only scored 26 goals in 95 matches for United, while Antony has only recorded 17 goal involvements in 96 appearances.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim’s ‘decision’ on Rasmus Hojlund has reportedly sparked his desire to ‘return to his former club’.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr have reportedly made an ‘offer’ to Man Utd for Antony as Cristiano Ronaldo’s team ‘continue to explore Europe’.",
      "Man Utd could use Rasmus Hojlund to ‘compensate’ Juventus if they beat them to Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani, according to reports.",
      "We’ve analysed the Man Utd first-team squad and decided who should be kept, sold, or loaned out before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a final decision on whether to offload Rasmus Hojlund this summer amid two key factors.",

      "7) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Manchester United have whittled their striker shortlist down to two – which could spell further bad news for Newcastle United…",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Jackson is off Man Utd’s list because of the anticipated costs involved. Which Chelsea won’t compromise on if they know Newcastle have an Isak-sized windfall on the way.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Juventus\nThe Old Lady are the latest to throw their hat in the ring for Nunez, who was previously a target for Napoli. Liverpool have been keen to sell the Uruguayan striker for a while, but they are even more eager now that Alexander Isak is available…",

      "16) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Borussia Dortmund\nThe Gunners man is on Dortmund’s list of winger targets, with Jadon Sancho also under consideration. Arsenal could reinvest some of the money into Rodrygo, which means their supporters are bang up for this.",
      "",
      "15) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "14) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "13) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "12) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one has picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. We could see this happening, but not quickly.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But now here come Man Utd. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nThis rumour is a re-entry into the top 20 amid reports Sesko is one of two names on United’s striker shortlist. The Red Devils could be helped by talk of a gentleman’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko that he could go for £60million to one of a select few clubs, which United are among. But Newcastle are not. And one suspects Leipzig might change their tune when Newcastle are trying to throw at them whatever Isak money there might be. For United’s sake, we hope Sesko got something in writing.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle are trying to fight what feels like the inevitable and we should see something in the way of an offer from Liverpool this week. We can be almost certain the first bid will fail, but when the player is as keen to move as Isak reportedly is, the Toon are fighting the tide. The Swede just needs to hope that Liverpool’s desire matches his own.",
      "",
      "4)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Some reports suggest a deal has already been done. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "3) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, who looks set for a switch to St James’ Park, where he shouldn’t experience another relegation.",
      "",
      "2) Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nThis looked to be off when Erik ten Hag said he could not afford to lose any more players this summer. But someone at Leverkusen has overruled the new coach by agreeing a £13million deal with Sunderland, who could pay another £4million in add-ons. Xhaka, who stated early his preference for Sunderland over Saudi, is already in Wearside for a medical.",

      "But at least Manchester United had the self-awareness to rule out a move for Alexander Isak. Once his name and that of Nicolas Jackson was scribbled out along with that of Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap earlier in the summer, this bizarre battle between Watkins and Sesko became inevitable as the two strikers left standing with no similarities beyond their position.",
      "It is not quite the same scenario the club faced with Hojlund and Kane in 2023. There was a chasm between those two players and it was reflected in the cost required to complete either deal. Manchester United also did well to rule out the latter early – then obviously dragged their heels over the former to the extent he was signed a week before the season started.",

      "While Manchester United scour Europe for someone, anyone willing to pay anything for their unwanted cast of very talented footballers they’ve decided they have no use for, other Premier League teams have shown themselves to be adept at selling players to balance their books and boost their summer spending sprees, with Chelsea proving to be the masters.",
      "The Blues have four player sales in this top 10, which includes transfers which have been agreed but not yet signed and sealed.",
      "",
      "10) Bashir Humphreys: Chelsea to Burnley, £10m\nThat’s £10m of pure profit for a left-back with a market value of £6m, who made two appearances for Chelsea and was never going to make another one.",
      "The cash has been immediately spent on teenage centre-back Mamadou Sarr, who started 27 games to help Strasbourg into the Conference League last season. As becomes clearer as you go down this page, Chelsea remain experts in filling their coffers.",
      "",
      "9) Djordje Petrovic: Chelsea to Bournemouth, £22m rising to £25m\nWe’re entirely ready to accept that Chelsea may have sold their best goalkeeper. That may be Petrovic, it may be Kepa Arrizabalaga. But for us they’re all equally sh*t, average and alright, depending on what mood we’re in, so they may as well make a £10m PSR-boosting profit on Petrovic and have Robert Sanchez feebly tending goal again with the identically inadequate Filip Jorgensen in reserve if they’re really actually not going to sign a decent option to match the progression of the rest of the squad.",
      "",
      "8) Lloyd Kelly: Newcastle to Juventus, £14.5m rising to £20m\nWe’re pleased for Kelly, who probably thought – as we did – that he would play more for Newcastle having made what looked like a decent move for both player and club last summer.",
      "But after starting three of the opening five games following his free transfer, Kelly featured for just 96 minutes in the next 19 games before sealing a loan exit to Juventus.",
      "And the key part he played for the Old Lady – nailing down a spot at the heart of their defence – suggests Newcastle may come to regret the obligation to buy that was enforced when a limited appearance-based condition was met. But without knowing the heights Kelly will reach in Serie A and beyond, Newcastle will currently be seeing this as a huge PSR win.",
      "",
      "7) Yan Couto: Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund, £21m rising to £25m\nCouto joins a list of 12 players, including Pedro Porro, Aaron Mooy, Jason Denayer, Jack Harrison and Douglas Luiz, that City have sold for a combined £113m having never made an appearance for club. Incredible.",
      "Maximo Peronne was also sold this summer, to Como for £11.2m, having featured for just 20 minutes in a City shirt.",
      "",
      "6) Anthony Elanga: Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, £52m rising to £55m\nNo other team in world football is paying that fee for Elanga. That definitely doesn’t mean it was wrong for Newcastle to pay it, before all of this Alexander Isak heartache it was the one area of the pitch where there was the biggest potential for improvement and he’s a very Eddie Howe player – direct, powerful and speedy.",
      "But Forest must have been a tad surprised when Newcastle returned with an extra £10m after seeing their initial £45m bid knocked back for the Swede. He’s valued at £36m and cost them under £20m.",
      "A penny for the thoughts of the Manchester United chief who opened the door to that sale to Forest in the summer of 2023 due to ‘reservations over Elanga’s ability to break down stubborn defences in a United team that had expectations to dominate possession during games’ before sacking that manager and hiring one whose modus operandi is dynamism in transition.",
      "Now we think about it, United are the second team in world football who would have paid that fee for Elanga had that move not required a hilarious and embarrassing climbdown.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo: Brentford to Manchester United, £65m rising to £71m\nThere was a time when mid-table Premier League sides were bullied into letting their prized assets leave for Manchester United. As soon as they came calling, that was that, with a club the size of Brentford expected to kiss rings and bow in appreciation of the Red Devils bestowing such honour on them by being interested in one of their players.",
      "Not for the first time, nor we suspect the last, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Ineos lads played their hand way too early. Brentford weren’t happy that they approached Mbeumo first, and when the forward then made it clear he only wanted the move to Old Trafford despite interest from Tottenham and Newcastle, the Red Devils created a situation for themselves where they either had to meet Brentford’s demand – which didn’t change despite contrary reports pushed by United – or flounce away from their top target to the great enjoyment of the masses who feed on evidence that a once-great club is great no longer.",
      "They opted save face and were indeed ‘held to ransom’ despite Ratcliffe’s insistence that he wouldn’t be, paying some £18m over Mbeumo’s market value.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke: Chelsea to Arsenal, £48.5m rising to £50m\nIn our latest instalment of Both Things Can Be True, we see this as a good signing from Arsenal but also a very good sale by Chelsea. The Gunners wanted an option for both left and right wings, whose first thought is to take defenders on, at a good age with a high ceiling; Madueke is all those things.",
      "And while the logic in coaching a player, watching them improve and then selling them before seeing whether they can fulfil their potential in favour of someone at the onset of what will likely be a very similar journey in Jamie Gittens is at best questionable and at worst a sign that Chelsea as a football club aren’t actually all that interested in developing young talent but buying and selling them until they uncover ready-made gems, on the face of it they have made close to £20m on a forward who got 20 goals and nine assists in 92 appearances for them.",
      "",
      "3) Luis Diaz: Liverpool to Bayern Munich, £65.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox should take note. Weirdly, the best way to get the most amount of money for a footballer who wants to leave and you don’t particularly want at your football club for at least that reason and possibly others, isn’t to drop them to a bomb squad and announce to the world that you’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "The party line from Liverpool and Arne Slot for the majority of this transfer window, amid interest from Barcelona, Saudi Arabia and Bayen, was that they had ‘no plans’ to sell Diaz.",
      "They also had no plan to offer him an improved contract, and will therefore have known that Diaz would likely push for an exit. But he went on tour with Slot and his teammates, at least providing interested clubs with the illusion of a possible harmonious future at the club if they fail to up the ante.",
      "And Bayern did. After the Premier League champions rejected an opening bid of £58.6m from the Bundesliga giants, they’ve now accepted a £65.5m bid including add-ons, or 44% of an Alexander Isak, for a 28-year-old valued by Transfermarkt at £60m.",
      "",
      "2) Jarell Quansah: Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m rising to £35m\nWe have no way of finding this out/didn’t even try, but we posit that there has never been a greater transfer-fee-per-senior-start paid (yes, it’s a thing if we say so) than the £875,000 Bayer Leverkusen have spent on Quansah per appearance from the off under Jurgen Klopp and Arne Slot at Anfield.",
      "Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are admittedly a very good reason why Quansah’s not played all that much and it’s technically possible for the game time of the third best centre-back in the world to be limited in a similar manner.",
      "But he wouldn’t be in many people’s top 50 as things stand and that was just too delicious a chunk of pure profit to turn down, with the Reds also safe in the knowledge that they can buy him back for £50m should his progression be as impressive as many of us thought it may be a year or so ago.",
      "",
      "1) Joao Felix: Chelsea to Al Nassr, £26m rising to £44m\nThe guaranteed £26m fee brings the total spent by clubs acquiring what we don’t think anyone will disagree are Felix’s limited services to just over £180m.",
      "After bizarrely spending £44m to sign him from Atletico Madrid last summer after a hugely underwhelming loan spell at Stamford Bridge the season before, Chelsea are miraculously set to make all of that money back thanks to Al Nassr, and could actually be up on the deal having already banked close to £5m from his six-month loan spell at AC Milan.",
      "The Blues are also said to have wisely inserted a hefty sell-on clause into the deal with Al Nassr, as another wealthy football club thinking they can ‘fix’ Joao Felix is the third certainty after death and taxes.",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is set to accept a ‘pay cut’ in order to seal a ‘dream transfer’ this summer, according to reports.",
      "A list of 14 players could reportedly be made available by Chelsea this summer, with some big names expected to be surplus to requirements.",
      "Leeds United will stay in the Premier League if they sign a ‘new Raphinha’. Simple enough, right? We’ve created a ten-player shortlist for Daniel Farke.",
      "Former AC Milan and Chelsea great Marcel Desailly has seen plenty of Joao Felix over his itinerant career and feels he just still hasn’t ‘found his place’",
      "A new report has revealed ‘eleven’ Chelsea players are set to be sold this summer as club chiefs are looking to raise funds for a ‘super signing’."

      "",
      "1) Takehiro Tomiyasu (Arsenal)\n“Unfortunately, injuries have limited Tomi’s time on the pitch in the past two seasons, with the defender making just one substitute appearance last season. It was therefore mutually agreed to end Tomi’s contract in order for him to start a new chapter in his career,” said Arsenal. His ongoing knee injury means he could be on this list for a while.",

      "Isak is said to be ‘furious’ with Newcastle and has even been accused of ‘starting to check out’ towards the end of last season.",
      "It is thought that Liverpool will ramp up their attempts to procure the Swede from St James’ Park once the clever sale of Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich has been sanctioned.",
      "Newcastle remain steadfast in their desire to keep Isak but his omission from the squad for their pre-season tour of the Far East was a significant moment in the summer-long saga, the first meaningful weakening of the Magpies’ position.",

      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any \"stragglers\" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.",
      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",
      "Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.",
      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",
      "While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I can't be any worse than it was last season,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",
      "\"I'm enjoying that. Aims-wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I know people will be questioning me for saying that after last season, but it has to be that. It's not just me who thinks that. I'm sure the whole team, if you ask them, they all have the same aims.",
      "\"Even the manager, I'm sure he probably wouldn't say it in the press, but we all have to have the same beliefs and ambitions. Like I said, that real family feeling together, and we all strive for the same thing.\"",
      "Since Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, he has overseen a period of change to the squad with some understood to be allowed to leave this summer.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof left the club upon the expiry of their contracts at the end of June, while Jonny Evans announced his retirement, taking up a role in United's academy.",
      "Marcus Rashford, who was also training away from the main squad after returning from a six-month loan spell at Aston Villa this summer, has secured a loan move to Barcelona, which includes an option to buy for the LaLiga side.",
      "After Rashford's departure, United continue to work on exits for Sancho, Antony and Malacia - as well as Garnacho.",

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",

      "Man Utd's Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan; the deal gives Barca the option to buy the England international,  27, at the end of the season; the forward's Man Utd career has appeared over since a public fallout with manager Ruben Amorim last winter",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",
      "The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.",
      "The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.",
      "Apt.",
      "Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
