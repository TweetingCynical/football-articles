      "Former Manchester United ace Nani believes that Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were both showing signs of \"stress and pressure\" in the early weeks of the season following their summer moves.",
      "The pair both moved to Old Trafford - which cost the club £133million. United activated Cunha's release clause in his Wolves contract to make him their first summer signing before they eventually got a deal over the line to land Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United struggled in the opening weeks of the season, winning just one of their first five games in all competitions. Cunha and Mbeumo both missed penalties in the humiliating Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby and only found their best form in moments.",
      "Nani maintained that the duo needed time to adapt to the demands of playing in Manchester. Mbeumo himself has got off the mark, scoring twice, but Cunha remains without a goal, owing in part to an injury lay off, but both men are tipped to make a strong impact.",
      "He told GiveMeSport: “I think they will bring a lot of good things. Like I said, to play for Man United is not the same as playing for any team. There’s a lot of pressure, there’s a lot of history behind it. These players, they’ve got quality, they’ve got power, we know they can do something – but they need time.",
      "“At the beginning of the season, you could see probably some stress, some pressure on top of them, some responsibility, you know. But once they stabilise, they’ll do what they know.”",
      "Old Trafford has been a place where big names go and fail to deliver - a trend dating back well over a decade. United have spent big to sign numerous players who were big successes before they headed to Manchester, only to struggle to replicate that form. The signings of Cunha and Mbeumo were motivated by the fact both men have proven themselves in England.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo have both netted against United at their previous club. The latter endured a difficult first return to Brentford recently with the Bees beating the Red Devils 3-1 in west London as the pressure further ramped up on Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese boss needs his new signings to click into gear if they are to climb the table. Mbeumo and Cunha were joined by £74m man Benjamin Sesko, who joined from RB Leipzig, with those in Manchester accepting they need much more firepower.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson, in the eyes of many, is the greatest manager to ever live. His success and honours, first at Aberdeen, then Manchester United, across several decades go before him.",
      "But what about those who learned from him? There's plenty who claim that a manager's legacy is in part down to how they influence those around them. Johan Cruyff to Pep Guardiola an obvious example. The Manchester City boss has seen a number of those close to him - Mikel Arteta and Xabi Alonso - since go on to prove themselves in the dugout.",
      "For Ferguson he's seen many of his pupils struggle to translate being a great player into a great manager. The Class of 92 were the bedrock of United's success, but few of those have made impressive careers in the dugout.",
      "There are some exceptions and others still have time to prove themselves. Michael Carrick is someone tipped to enjoy an impressive spell as a manager and he's now linked with the Rangers job.",
      "Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy are more big names to turn their hand to management. The latter had an interim stint in Manchester and does have honours of his CV.",
      "None of Fergie's disciples have truly become icons of management. There are trophies and promotions smattered with sackings and fading into obscurity for the most part. Laurent Blanc achieved plenty of success with PSG after winning a title with Bordeaux and is probably the most accomplished for now. But when it's all said and done, who could be remembered as the best?",
      "Carrick enjoyed a steady spell with Middlesbrough before being relieved of his duties but he has already had an endorsement from Cristiano Ronaldo for what he can achieve as a coach. The midfielder was understated during his playing career and his experience at the very top without being a superstar who cannot connect should stand him in good stead.",
      "The former England star will be suited to a higher level of football and should thrive when given his opportunity. Even outside of management, he is preparing for the top in a technical observer role with UEFA.",
      "A shout-out for Robin van Persie too. The legendary forward is flying with Feyenoord and could soon be pressing his case.",
      "If you wanted to be harsh, you might say the managerial careers of Ferguson’s United charges show he was a man who developed players rather than bosses. More generously, you might use it to argue his singular managerial talents were something not even he could teach.",
      "There has been as much good as bad with even the more successful of Fergie’s charges. Steve Bruce and Mark Hughes both had high moments in the Premier League but looking at the relative decline of the pair makes it hard to make the case for them now, while Blanc surely had plenty of other influences to call upon before his late-career stint under Ferguson’s tutelage.",
      "Others might eventually make something big happen, with Van Nistelrooy’s fast start derailed by his Leicester nightmare and Heinze going down the No.2 path for now - with some success - after an up-and-down career as the main man across the Americas.",
      "Instead, I’m giving the nod to Mark Robins, who worked wonders in his second Coventry spell to earn two promotions despite a litany of off-field distractions - and even came within inches of stunning United in an FA Cup semi-final.",
      "It’s not a great hit rate for Fergie, but Robins’ success came in a manner which would do his old mentor proud. Indeed, Ferguson himself had to overcome challenging spells before the success came, not least with a must-win cup tie where he was rescued by none other than Robins himself, so this one seems appropriate.",
      "The United job is a poisoned chalice - and there’s only been one of Sir Alex’s former stars brave enough to claim the role. And that’s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Despite a difficult spell at Cardiff City, the Norwegian was a convenient if clever appointment by Red Devils chiefs in 2018. It immediately got the fans on side and given the form that United enjoyed during the early weeks of his tenure, it was a productive move.",
      "Remarkably, he has managed the most games of any United boss since Ferguson’s retirement, a fact that shouldn't be forgotten. And while Solskjaer did not manage to win a trophy and his spell in charge did not end in the best way, the fact he managed to stabilise what has been a perennially sinking ship is notable.",
      "Sure, Blanc has the trophies and the pedigree. But the sheer fact that Solskjaer managed to make United look like a relatively competent outfit during his time in charge is arguably one of his biggest accomplishments.",
      "It is easy to look at Blanc and claimed that anyone can win with PSG, although it must be said the manner of his success was quite something. The French job maybe didn't go as planned but his best managerial achievement is certainly claiming the title with Bordeaux.",
      "Landing Ligue 1 in 2009 was a truly stunning effort. It was only Bordeaux's sixth league title in their history and their first in a decade. Blanc's managerial prowess was underlined the following year when they enjoyed a run to the last eight of the Champions League - which included securing a historic win over Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena as they twice downed the German giants.",
      "Among Ferguson's homegrown players, Carrick has all the hallmarks of a manager who could go on to have an impressive managerial career. He had an unbeaten interim stint in Manchester in the wake of Solskjaer's sacking.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's shortage of on-field leaders represents Ruben Amorim's most pressing challenge - at least according to former Premier League frontman Emile Heskey. The Red Devils have endured a troubling campaign, prompting scrutiny over Amorim's tactical blueprint.",
      "United are in 10th place in the Premier League standings, managing three victories, one draw and three defeats from their opening seven top-flight games. They also suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two outfit Grimsby Town.",
      "The team, however, emerged as 2-0 victors against Sunderland in their final game before October's international break. It's a result they will aim to capitalise on when Premier League action resumes next weekend.",
      "Much discussion has centred on Amorim's unwillingness to abandon his preferred 3-4-2-1 system. Yet Heskey has highlighted a different concern within the United ranks.",
      "\"Nothing seems to go right for Ruben Amorim,\" he told Pundit Arena. \"Everyone keeps talking about the tactics, but when you put 11 players on the pitch, they've got to fight.",
      "\"Where's your leaders? I remember playing at Liverpool, I was only 22 at the time, we had Gary McAllister and he would be on to us. Steven Gerrard was younger than me, he would be on to us, Sami Hyypia, too.",
      "\"It doesn't look like Man Utd have any leaders on the pitch, who are really digging people out.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes, United's captain, has been a constant presence on the pitch this season, missing only three minutes of their Premier League matches. However, his role within the team has sparked much debate.",
      "The arrivals of summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, both playing in attacking positions, has seen Fernandes shifted to a deeper role. It has led to some questioning whether this allows him to perform at his best.",
      "Ahead of Portugal's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland last week, Fernandes addressed these concerns, stating: \"I love playing football, whatever the position.",
      "\"They can put me at full-back, winger, or as a goalkeeper. I'll always give my best.\"",
      "He added: \"Everyone has their preferences. But we have to adapt to the coach's ideas.\"",

      "Manchester United’s board remain behind Ruben Amorim, having previously reached a ‘unanimous’ decision over his predecessor. The Portuguese coach is under huge pressure at Old Trafford following a woeful start to the season.",
      "United sit tenth in the Premier League following just three league wins since the start of the campaign. That has seen Amorim’s future called into question, with chiefs having already held crisis talks over his future.",
      "Earlier this month, it was revealed that Old Trafford powerbrokers had spoken to players about their head coach - coming away with the impression the dressing room remain fully behind him.",
      "As it stands, United are retain faith in their manager, with confidence he will eventually get it right. Amorim may feel slightly fortunate that he has been given a stay of execution given the same privilege was not afforded to his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman endured a woeful third season at the club despite having lifted the FA Cup the campaign before and was consequently sacked. Before he was officially jettisoned, United held a board meeting to decide Ten Hag’s future, with all of the prominent chiefs voting ‘unanimously’ for the former Ajax man to be moved on.",
      "And while a decision on Amorim’s own future will be one decided by the club’s bosses, the opinion of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is sure to hold considerable weight. As it stands, it appears that the Ineos boss is keen to see the former Sporting Lisbon man remain in the hotseat.",
      "Asked if Amorim is set to be given time, Ratcliffe said: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Pressed on whether the Glazers would have a say, Ratcliffe replied: \"It's not going to happen,\" before adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",

      "The Catalan giants do hold an option to make Rashford's move permanent for £30million come 2026. After his eye-catching displays since September's international break, Barcelona are keen to tie down the England ace - but are hoping to land a cut-price deal worth around £26million.",

      "Wharton, 21, joined the Eagles from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024 for an initial £18million outlay. And the youngster has quickly become an integral member at Selhurst Park, helping the club win the FA Cup and secure a return to European competition earlier this year.",
      "He wasn't able to prevent a 2-1 loss at Everton just prior to the international break but nonetheless performed admirably in his duties. At least that was according to opponent and match-winner Grealish, who gave a glowing review to any potential suitors - including United.",
      "Speaking unprompted, the Everton winger said: \"Adam Wharton today...I can see the Man of the Match award there. I think that's coming to me. But it should have gone to Adam Wharton, because in my opinion he was the best player on the pitch.\"",
      "After spending heavily on upgrading their attack, the next area of focus is in midfield. Casemiro's £300,000-a-week contract is due to expire in the summer of 2026 and it's understood the Red Devils won't trigger their option to extend his deal by another year.",

      "Roy Keane admits that Manchester United should be \"pretty ashamed\" of their decision to pull out of the FA Cup in 2000 when they were defending champions - instead choosing to play in the Club World Cup.",
      "The Red Devils had won the domestic cup as part of their famed treble in 1999, but became the first team ever not to even attempt to defend their crown the following year. They instead chose to to play in the inaugural World Team Championship, now known as the Club World Cup.",
      "United accepted the Football Association’s offer to miss the competition. Chelsea went on to win the competition, beating Aston Villa in the final at Wembley.",
      "The decision resulted in widespread criticism from supporters and the media, who accused the Manchester outfit of devaluing the oldest football competition in the world. Former chairman Martin Edwards said at the time that they had \"no alternative\" and made the decision \"in the national interest\".",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson's side would only win one of their three games in the eight-team Club World Championship in Brazil - finishing third in Group B behind Mexican side Necaxa and eventual runners-up Vasco da Gama.",
      "Keane's comments began with Gary Neville saying on The Stick to Football podcast: \"I think one thing that was definitely better back in the day was the FA Cup. That was magic when we were playing.\"",
      "The Irishman, who would win the FA Cup four times during his career, then said: \"I think the magic has come back a bit the last few years now. When you think of it when we were at United, we should be pretty ashamed because we pulled out of the FA Cup. I know it wasn’t down to us but we accepted it as players. How mad was that, your team pulling out of the FA Cup.\"",
      "United claimed it was an opportunity \"to compete for the ultimate honour of being the very first world club champions\" - even if they did fail to bring the trophy home. It didn't stop their ultimate goal of retaining their Premier League title, which they did by 18 points.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is already regarded as one of Serie A's most impressive strikers after his loan move to Napoli from Manchester United.",
      "The 22-year-old attacker secured a switch the Italian side on a season-long loan deal this summer following Ruben Amorim's decision that he was not needed at Old Trafford. Although he initially wanted to remain at the Theatre of Dreams and compete for his spot, despite the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, his choice to depart appears to have been vindicated.",
      "Hojlund managed just four Premier League goals for United during the previous campaign, contributing to the club's dismal 15th-place finish in English football's top tier. Yet in merely six outings between Serie A and the Champions League, the £72m forward has already equalled that scoring record while playing under Napoli boss Antonio Conte.",
      "Lazio ace and Denmark colleague Gustav Tang Isaksen has revealed how Hojlund is perceived in Italy following his struggles at United. \"Yes, they always say he's one of the best,\" Isaksen told Viaplay Sport Denmark.",
      "\"So I think a lot of people have recognised how good he is,\" Isaksen told Viaplay Sport Denmark. \"They consistently say he's among the top players, yes.\"",
      "Denmark manager Brian Riemer has, meanwhile, taken what appears to be a subtle swipe at United regarding Hojlund's displays for Napoli.",
      "When asked if Hojlund could still thrive in England, Riemer said, via TipsBladet: \"I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion.",
      "\"Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that.",
      "\"But that doesn't mean he doesn't fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.\"",
      "He added: \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It is more important than which league you play in.\"",

      "Despite the vast sums spent improving Manchester United's attack in the summer, the club are being touted for another major signing who can help the goal drought. That's after former England playmaker Chris Waddle backed the Red Devils to recruit Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo.",
      "The Ghana international will cost a pretty penny, however, having carried on his form with a superb start to the new season. And the same could be said for Crystal Palace sensation Adam Wharton after enjoying his own fruitful campaign to date.",
      "Only Erling Haaland (10) has racked up more direct goal involvements than Semenyo (nine) so far this season. So it's little wonder the winger is attracting interest from some Premier League powerhouses.",
      "Bournemouth feel their player, who signed a new five-year contract in July, is worth upwards of £75million. However, Chris Waddle believes the Red Devils would be making a smart investment by targeting the 25-year-old.",
      "\"Antoine Semenyo, the winger at Bournemouth, is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now,\" Waddle told BestBettingSites. \"Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players.",
      "\"I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now.\"",
      "Much has been made of United not boasting the same appeal to players as they once did. The club aren't featuring in European competitions this season, which will inevitably be an obstacle to certain players wanting to head to Old Trafford.",
      "However, Waddle is assured the Red Devils will be back to their best at some point in the future. And he believes the allure is still sufficient to land a player of Semenyo's quality.",
      "\"People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still,\" he added. \"If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them. He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.\"",
      "Those comments don't account for another signing, Bryan Mbeumo, who didn't come cheap given United paid an initial £65m. And adding more new talent to the attack becomes complicated given the sums already spent upgrading this past summer.",
      "It seems only a matter of time before Wharton becomes the latest star at Crystal Palace to complete a big-money move elsewhere. And Eagles chairman Steve Parish has suggested United will be at a disadvantage as long as they're without Champions League football.",
      "Wharton, 21, is reportedly poised to become the subject of a £60m offer from the Red Devils. However, Parish clarified the player's intentions to feature among Europe's finest and there's no guarantee of Champions League participation in United's future.",
      "\"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club,\" he told talkSPORT. \"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "\"He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get. I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from.\"",
      "The Red Devils failed to qualify for any form of continental competition this term after a record-low 15th-place league finish last season.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side moved up to 10th after winning their last three home games but they're still waiting on a first away victory of the campaign.",
      "Wharton, who has watched the likes of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze leave Palace for huge teams in the last 18 months, now stands clear as arguably Palace's most valuable asset. The Eagles are involved in Europe themselves this season as they compete for the Europa Conference League but United could one day fulfil even loftier aspirations.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is keeping himself in tip-top shape during the October international break, despite struggling to secure a spot in Ruben Amorim's plans at Old Trafford. The Stockport-born youngster has found it tough to compete with Bruno Fernandes for a starting XI position, which has limited his playing time.",
      "Mainoo has been used in the advanced No.10 role, but the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have further complicated his chances of starting there. The 20-year-old's lack of game time this season prompted him to request a loan move away from United.",
      "With the World Cup looming at the end of the season, Mainoo needs regular playing time to be considered for Thomas Tuchel's England squad. However, Amorim turned down Mainoo's request, insisting he is needed as part of his team.",
      "Having not yet started a Premier League match for United this season, the issue of a transfer is likely to resurface when the January window opens. But if Mainoo is feeling frustrated at Old Trafford, he's not letting it affect his professionalism.",
      "During the October international break, Mainoo flew to Marbella to gear up for the return of the Premier League. While soaking up the Spanish sun, Mainoo has kept up his training both on the pitch and in the gym.",
      "The midfielder also shared snaps of himself working out in the gym, captioning them 'blessed'. It's a sight that will surely please Amorim as he sees Mainoo maintaining his professional attitude.",
      "Meanwhile, the midfielder is undoubtedly eager for his moment to shine sooner rather than later. United face off against Liverpool in their next Premier League match this Sunday afternoon.",
      "Speaking last month, Amorim said: \"I didn't have a conversation with him before the window closed because I didn't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having a conversation with him just to hold on to him. I did it this week.",
      "\"I believe in him a lot. He is a top player. But some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done [a complete player]. I think he can do so much better.",
      "\"For some guys [talent] is enough, but for him it is not. Maybe it's not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie and that's it.\"",

      "Manchester United winger Antony has disclosed that his fellow Brazilian Matheus Cunha pleaded with him to remain at Old Trafford before his permanent transfer to Real Betis. Antony was Erik ten Hag's headline acquisition at United but his displays failed to justify his £85m price tag.",
      "When Ten Hag was ultimately dismissed in October 2024, the Brazilian's stint in Manchester seemed to be drawing to a close. Ruben Amorim's arrival virtually confirmed his departure with the new setup at United not suitable for wingers.",
      "By January, Amorim had secured a loan deal for Antony to Real Betis and this succeeded in rejuvenating his career. The winger netted nine goals and provided five assists in Spain as he assisted his side in reaching the Conference League final.",
      "At the end of the campaign, Antony returned to Manchester and told the club that he wanted to depart. Nevertheless, Antony has disclosed that Cunha, who arrived from Wolverhampton Wanderers at the start of the summer transfer window, encouraged the Brazilian to remain.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha wanted me to play there with him, but the situation was already very difficult,\" he told AS. \"I have a lot of affection for him.\"",

      "The Spanish giants are in the early phase of trying to retain their La Liga crown and have begun the season impressively, but plans are already being made for next term. It appears that has involved them making the shock decision to let their premier marksman leave.",
      "Lewandowski is now 37 and joined Barcelona from Bayern Munich in a £42.5million deal back in the summer 2022. He's been crucial to their recent success, scoring 105 times in 156 appearances, but the club's bosses will not offer him a new deal.",
      "Catalan paper Sport claim that they don't believe Lewandowski is still able to press with the required intensity and that his decline has begun. That is despite the Pole scoring four La Liga goals in just three starts so far this term.",
      "Lewandowski's wages are also thought to be an issue for the club, who have battled financial issues and penalties recently. The Pole remains a top earner and club boss Deco claimed that they would not be entertaining contract talk this early into the year.",
      "The sporting director said: \"We’re not going to talk about renewals in October. We’re taking it step by step. He’s (Lewandowski) one of the best strikers of recent years, a top-level player. He’s helped us a lot. He’s scored more than 40 goals, but we will analyse it. It’s time to talk about getting injured players back.\"",
      "The situation means that Rashford could see his dream move become permanent with the Manchester United outcast currently on loan in Spain. He's shown in moments what he can do, scoring a stunning brace as they downed Newcastle in the Champions League.",

Leading lights in Barcelona have been impressed by the 27-year-old's work ethic and talent. They can make the deal permanent at the end of the season by paying an initial £25m plus £5m in add-ons.",
      "Rashford has come into Hansi Flick's attack which already included Raphinha and Lamine Yamal, who narrowly missed out on the Ballon d'Or recently. Dani Olmo is among their other talents with Barcelona only denied a treble last term by their Champions League semi-final defeat to Inter Milan.",

      "The France job will become vacant after next summer's World Cup and the Les Blues icon has made it clear that taking charge of the national team is on his radar. Didier Deschamps has already confirmed he will step down as manager after 14 years in charge.",
      "He and Zidane were part of the France side that won the 1998 World Cup. Deschamps has become one of only three men to win the World Cup as a player and a manager, having led France to success in 2018. Zidane would have the chance to become the fourth if he did take charge.",
      "He has been a guest at the Festival dello Sport in Trento over the weekend and claimed: \"I will definitely return.” Zidane went on to say: “In terms of the future, I don’t know. My feeling is that I want to be able to coach the national team in the future, even though I don’t mean right now. I would like to one day, but we’ll see.”",
      "Zizou has previously been linked with the Manchester United job, but there has never been any approach from those at Old Trafford. Instead they've gone after the likes of Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim, who now holds the post.",
      "It is understood that the two main candidates to take charge of France are Zidane and Thierry Henry - another 1998 World Cup winner. France have been regulars in the latter stages of tournaments - making the semi-finals of the last Euros and losing in the most recent World Cup final.",
      "Zidane has been linked with another former club in Juventus in the past. The Italian giants are the club where Zidane made his name on the European stage before his then world-record move to Real. They have lost their grip as Serie A's elite outfit and previously appointed the likes of Igor Tudor and Thiago Motta.",
      "The French icon remains unsure whether he will ever head to Turin as manager. \"I don't know. It hasn't happened before, I've made other choices,\" he said. \"Juve will always remain in my heart, it gave me a lot from the beginning when I went there. As for the future, I don't know.\"",

United have been strongly connected with finding a replacement for Ruben Amorim following another difficult start to the season.",
      "The win against Sunderland before the international break eased some pressure on his position. This was accompanied midweek by Sir Jim Ratcliffe publicly declaring his desire to afford Amorim three years to demonstrate his capabilities.",
      "Nevertheless, there remains uncertainty over whether this position is permanent, particularly should United fail to qualify for European competition next term. Should Amorim face the axe, Glasner has surfaced as amongst the leading contenders for the role.",
      "The Austrian has made his mark at Selhurst Park after claiming the FA Cup last campaign and guiding Palace to a club-record 19-match undefeated streak that was only halted by Everton last weekend. Glasner's agreement with the Eagles runs until this season's conclusion and, thus far, no fresh deal has materialised.",
      "When questioned by talkSPORT regarding his manager's future, Parish disclosed that negotiations are ongoing. \"We've had some early conversations,\" Parish explained.",
      "\"We would love to keep Oliver, we're building something.\" However, Parish did concede that Glasner is a manager with high aspirations, aiming for more trophies in his career after leading Palace to their first major silverware.",

      "\"So if we can align those interests then hopefully we can make something happen.\" When asked directly this week if he would be interested in taking the United job if it was offered to him, Glasner chose to dodge the question about his future.",
      "\"As I said, I try to keep it at bay, whether I'm successful or unsuccessful, partly for self-protection,\" he responded after receiving the Coach of the Year award at Austria's Sporthilfe Gala. \"A few years ago, I got into the habit of living in the here and now and enjoying it.",

      "With big money comes big expectations but all too often in the Premier League the most expensive players haven't delivered the ultimate prize. None of the top clubs spend record sums to get them to second or third spot.",
      "But over recent years some of the most lucrative moves have failed to take their club's to the summit of English football. Liverpool made Florian Wirtz the British-record transfer when they landed him from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer.",
      "Only weeks later and they smashed their own record with Alexander Isak joining from Newcastle for £125million. The pressure is now on for the Swede, who has been regarded as among the best strikers in the world, to ensure that Liverpool remain top of the pile.",
      "History suggests, at least in recent years, that the most expensive signings don't often deliver the title. In fact, cast your eye down the 10 most expensive transfers to an English side and you'll find just TWO men with a Premier League winner's medal - but even they struggled to hit the heights expected.",
      "They are Jack Grealish and Darwin Nunez. The ex-Aston Villa star boasts three titles to his name few would argue that he has justified his £100million fee since moving to Manchester City. Nunez left Liverpool in the summer, three years after his £85m switch from Benfica, which was more frustrating than successful.",
      "Isak is hoping to be more success than frustration. He joined a team that had looked a well oiled machine last term, but less so in the early weeks of this campaign. Already Arne Slot is having to figure out how the get the best from the Swede with much debate over how to best use him and the host of quality names in Liverpool's heavily stocked attack.",
      "Isak, but first Wirtz, exceeded the British-record transfer fee that had belonged to Enzo Fernandez. The Argentine moved from Benfica to Chelsea just months after becoming a World Cup winner. In Qatar he was named the best young player at the tournament - immediately attracting huge attention.",
      "Fernandez moved to Stamford Bridge in the January of 2023 for a then record £105m. He, so far, only has a Europa Conference League and a Club World Cup to his name. Team-mate Moises Caicedo joined only months later for £100m.",
      "At the time he penned a deal that had the potential to rise to £115m, which was a record fee. He has formed an impressive partnership with Fernandez in midfield but the two men have yet to make Chelsea title contenders.",
      "One man who has proved a huge hit is Declan Rice. He headed to Arsenal after impressing for years at West Ham with the Gunners investing £100m, rising to £105m with add-ons. The England midfielder is now regarded among the best in the league in his position.",
      "He's enjoyed some stunning moments for the north Londoners but is yet to land the title he and his team-mates crave. In his two years with Arsenal they've finished twice on both occasions, but do currently sit top of the pile at this early stage of the season.",
      "Back in 2021 Chelsea, when Roman Abramovich was the man still signing off on major deals, spent a club-record fee of £97.5m to bring Romelu Lukaku back to the club from Inter Milan. He was seen as the striker who could take Thomas Tuchel's side to the title.",
      "He scored on his debut and the early signs were ominous, but he soon tailed off, facing public criticism from his manager. The Belgian later departed for Napoli, where he's won another Serie A title, but the title in England certainly evaded him.",
      "1. Alexander Isak to Liverpool - £125m",
      "2. Florian Wirtz to Liverpool - £116m",
      "3. Moises Caicedo to Chelsea - £115m",
      "4. Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea - £105m",
      "5. Declan Rice to Arsenal - £105m",
      "6. Jack Grealish to Man City - £100m",
      "7. Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea - £97.5m",
      "8. Paul Pogba to Man Utd - £89m",
      "9. Darwin Nunez to Liverpool - £85m",
      "10. Antony to Man Utd - £82m",
      "Paul Pogba briefly held the title of the world's most expensive player when he headed back to Manchester United. He was Jose Mourinho's marquee signing upon his appointment at Old Trafford in 2016. But the Frenchman and the Red Devils were the furthest thing from a match made in heaven.",
      "He won two trophies in his first season in Manchester, but then went empty handed for the next five years before leaving for nothing. Antony's move in 2022 from Ajax is among the biggest failures in top flight history, but certainly a costly one. Needless to say he and United never came close to the Premier League title.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Antoine Semenyo would be an 'ideal' signing for Manchester United, according to former England international Chris Waddle. And the ex-Marseille star believes Semenyo is the best winger in the Premier League.",
      "The Bournemouth ace has enjoyed a phenomenal start to the season. The Cherries winger has bagged six goals and made three assists in his opening seven matches of the Premier League season.",
      "United, in addition to Tottenham and Liverpool, were linked with a summer move for the Ghana international. Ruben Amorim is even said to have met the star for dinner at the end of last season.",
      "The Red Devils invested heavily in their frontline over the summer. United spent £200million on adding Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Semenyo ultimately extended his Bournemouth contract early in the summer transfer window. The former Bristol City star committed himself to the Vitality Stadium until 2030.",
      "Waddle believes that the south coast club will still struggle to retain his services ,however. And the former winger believes he could form a potent combination entwined with Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"Antoine Semenyo, the winger at Bournemouth, is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now,\" Waddle told BestBettingSites.",
      "\"Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players.",

      "\"People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still.",
      "\"If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them. He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "\"You could see a real team developing, especially with Bruno Fernandes in behind. There’s a lot more to do, but I can see them building a team there.",
      "\"He’s the type of player that United fans would love, and it would be a great acquisition, but he won’t come cheap.\"",
      "\"This (Bournemouth) is my safe place. I felt wanted. It feels great. I want to be playing, that’s the most important thing for me. We’ve got a good group here and we’re wanting to achieve top things this year. So this is the best place to be right now.\"",

      "Crystal Palace's young midfield maestro, Adam Wharton, is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after talents in European football. The rumour mill is buzzing with reports that Manchester United are keen on snapping up the 21-year-old starlet.",
      "While additions like Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo have bolstered the squad, Ruben Amorim's side are still struggling to gel and the heat is beginning to mount on the Portuguese gaffer.",
      "United had their eyes on Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba during the summer transfer window but were deterred by the hefty £100m price tag slapped on him by The Seagulls.",
      "Clearly, Amorim and his team felt the need for reinforcements in the midfield. Skipper Bruno Fernandes was also rumoured to be considering a move to Saudi Arabia during the same period and at 31, it wouldn't be outlandish to think he might fancy a change in the next couple of transfer windows.",
      "Therefore, United need to start planning for the future and Wharton fits the bill perfectly. Reports suggest that United are prepared to shell out £60m for the English wonderkid, but it's highly likely that this sum will fall short of Palace's valuation.",
      "The London-based club has set a hefty £150m price tag on Wharton and with his contract not expiring until 2029, they hold the upper hand in any negotiation talks. Despite being content at Palace, the allure of joining one of England's top clubs could prove irresistible for Wharton.",
      "Having earned his first England cap and been a surprise addition to the squad that made it to the Euro 2024 final, Wharton has been absent from recent line-ups. However, he revealed that Thomas Tuchel assured him his performance was up to par and he was close to selection, but the coach wanted to maintain team consistency.",
      "\"Nothing is expected,\" Wharton stated. \"England have some top players and he's got a lot of players to choose from. No matter who he picks someone is not going to get in and there will be a fuss about it.",
      "\"I can't sit here and cry about it, this is football and I'm happy playing for Palace and getting minutes. I'll keep knocking on the door and if I'm in, I'm in and if not I'll carry on.\"",
      "As per The Daily Star, Amorim is reportedly a 'huge fan' of the young player.",
      "United may need to streamline their squad in upcoming transfer windows, which could play into their hands if they're keen on signing Wharton. Casemiro's departure from United seems imminent, but a move to Palace appears highly unlikely given his age and salary demands.",
      "The Mirror examines potential swap deals that could benefit both clubs....",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, once hailed as the next big thing, is no longer a regular on the pitch and had sought a loan move last summer for this very reason. His request was denied, so it's probable that the 20-year-old will be looking for a permanent transfer in the January window.",
      "With the World Cup looming next year, the England midfielder is keen to get more game time to secure his place in the squad. Palace would likely demand cash plus Mainoo in exchange for Wharton, whose value is currently at its peak.",
      "Another potential bargaining chip for United could be Dutch international Joshua Zirkzee. He arrived at Old Trafford amid high expectations but things haven't quite panned out for the 24-year-old.",
      "Despite being fielded as a striker on several occasions, he hasn't managed to cement his position, proving more effective in the number 10 role.",
      "AC Milan and Juventus have shown interest in Zirkzee, who joined United after an impressive stint with Bologna in Serie A. While Zirkzee doesn't fit into Wharton's deeper midfield position, his inclusion in a swap deal could give Palace additional firepower to support Mateta.",
      "As per TBR Football, Zirkzee has informed United officials of his desire to leave in the January window to secure a spot in the Netherlands' World Cup squad. A switch to The Eagles - offering regular Premier League football - might just be the smart move for Zirkzee.",
      "A swap deal involving Zirkzee and Mainoo could be a fair trade for Wharton. However, as previously noted, if only one of these players is on the table, Palace will likely demand additional cash.",

      "Roy Keane's daughter Caragh has opened up about her battle with lupus which left her bed bound for months. In 2021, Caragh, 29, was diagnosed with the chronic auto-immune disease which causes the body's immune system to attack healthy parts of the body.",
      "She visited the doctor when she was suffering from blistered skin, joint pains and hair loss. Caragh, who was a teacher by trade at the time, was so affected by the condition, she had to resign from her role a school in Manchester.",

      "\"I was teaching and I was thinking, 'Oh, I'm just really tired'. I was falling asleep while I was driving and things like that.",

      "\"Until I just physically couldn't move and was essentially bed bound for around three months. I wasn't able to teach. I was always quite sporty and love being active, so it was a real shock when I just wasn't able to do those things anymore.",
      "\"That led me to start researching gut health and just overall wellness. I hadn't heard of lupus before being diagnosed. So it's one of those things where it was a real shock to hear that.\"",

      "\"They're saying, 'How are you getting on?' And I love spending time with my family. So I drag them along to these food events.\"",

After handing out the boxes, he said: \"My daughter Caragh has got a company with health stuff. I am proud, very proud.\"",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will return to Manchester United training today with renewed hunger to show boss Ruben Amorim he is worthy of a first Premier League start of the season.",
      "United's players not involved on international duty were given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, and told to report back for training to begin the build-up to the weekend trip to arch rivals Liverpool.",
      "Mainoo is among those United players not required by his country during the international break, an unthinkable scenario 16 months ago when he started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain.",
      "But Mainoo's continued England exile is a measure of just how far he has fallen since scoring and starring in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City last year and starting that 2-1 defeat for the Three Lions in Berlin's Olympic Stadium seven weeks later.",
      "While some of United's players not representing their countries have taken the time off for some rest and recuperation, escaping to the sun before reporting back for duty tomorrow, Mainoo has made no secret of the fact he has been working hard on his strength and conditioning during his down time.",
      "Mainoo has been put through his paces by a fitness team at Complejo Deportivo Arroyo, Enmedio, a fitness centre and sports complex in the Spanish town of Estepona, posting to his 3.3million followers on Instagram pictures and videos of himself working out and pushing himself to the limit.",
      "The motivation for posting such content is clear – Mainoo and his camp want the world to see just how hard he is training and that he is doing everything he can to force his way into boss Ruben Amorim's plans and earn his way back into United's starting line-up.",
      "But the brutal reality for Mainoo seems to be that however many posts he uploads of himself working on his fitness, he is simply not trusted by Amorim to start a game, and with fixtures in short supply given United's failure to qualify for Europe and EFL Cup exit at League Two Grimsby, his exile is likely to continue.",
      "Against that backdrop, it will come as little surprise if Mainoo makes a fresh request to go out on loan in the January transfer window, by which time the World Cup will be just six months away, with time running out for the 20-year-old to force his way into Thomas Tuchel's squad.",
      "Tuchel's reluctance to pick Mainoo, despite the midfielder's undeniable talent, is understandable, for he cannot select players who are not playing regularly for their clubs, despite past exploits for England. Therein lies the problem for Mainoo – he has become an outcast for club and country, his career in limbo while Amorim remains in charge and refuses to trust him to start a game.",
      "The only solution to Mainoo's plight is Amorim leaving or United allowing him to leave on loan in the new year. Neither scenario seems likely, given Sir Jim Ratcliffe's recent insistence that Amorim needs time and United's previous decision to turn down Mainoo's loan request.",
      "In that sense, there seems to be no escape for Mainoo from his current predicament, a bleak situation for such a bright talent.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "On the face of it, Bruno Fernandes could hardly have been more positive when asked about playing in midfield for Manchester United.",
      "\"I love playing football, whatever the position,” said Fernandes, ahead of Portugal's 1-0 World Cup qualifier win over Republic of Ireland. “They can put me at full-back, winger, goalkeeper. I’ll always give my best.”",
      "But it was the follow-up remark from Fernandes that was most telling, suggesting the 31-year-old playmaker was far from happy at playing in a deeper-lying role on the insistence of boss Ruben Amorim.“Everyone has their preferences,” said United captain Fernandes. “But we have to adapt to the coach’s ideas.”",
      "The clear inference from that comment is that Fernandes would rather play in a more advanced role, where he has been most effective for United and can provide a greater attacking threat and influence.",
      "Fernandes and his camp are known to have taken umbrage at recent reports stating he is not happy with the role in which Amorim continues to deploy him and is desperate to play further up the pitch, with more freedom.",
      "What is undeniable is that being selected in midfield does not play to the attacking strengths of Fernandes. He is arguably United's most creative player and the one with the biggest goal threat, but those weapons are being nullified by where he is currently being played.",
      "In midfield, Fernandes is forced to think defensively as well as offensively, something that does not come naturally to him. It is a different mindset, focusing on thwarting opponents when you don't have the ball, rather than what you can do with it at your feet, which is where Fernandes excels.",
      "In his new role, Fernandes' objective is frequently not to unlock the opposition but to keep them under lock and key. That is likely to be the case when United return to Premier League action at arch rivals Liverpool on Sunday, where Fernandes will be tasked with being more of a spoiler than a match-winner, given how the game is likely to unfold, with the hosts enjoying greater possession, forcing Amorim's side into a policy of containment.",
      "That is not to say Fernandes is completely ill-suited to playing more centrally. His intrinsic work ethic and willingness to cover so much ground, as evidenced by some key challenges in the dying embers of United's hard-fought 2-1 win over Chelsea, is a key skill set for a midfielder.",
      "But Amorim's insistence on sticking with his contentious 3-4-2-1 system, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad or Mason Mount playing as the two behind Benjamin Sesko, means Fernandes has had to accept he is now a midfielder and will play there as long as his compatriot remains in charge.",
      "Publicly, players will rarely complain about the position they are asked to occupy and the role they are required to fulfil. Privately, though, Fernandes surely yearns for the days under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag, when he was able to maraud around the pitch, showcasing his prodigious attacking talent, without having to do any of the dirty work.",

      "Manchester United resume their Premier League campaign at Anfield next week buoyed by the 2-0 victory over Sunderland last time out.",
      "It was a convincing performance from the Reds and relieved some of the pressure on under-fire boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "United are 10th in the table and will hope to find consistency to sustain a challenge for a top six spot and European football next season.",
      "To do that, they need key players to perform and two United stars have hit their straps in recent weeks, offering Amorim an added dimension, competition and attacking threat.",
      "Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were the scorers against Sunderland and both look set to keep their places for the trip to Liverpool.",
      "Mount has suffered two injury-hit years since his arrival at Old Trafford but Amorim has remained convinced that the England international has plenty to offer if fully-fit.",
      "The 26-year-old played in one of the two number 10 roles against Sunderland and opened the scoring with a smart finish. Mount has been used in a plethora of positions already this term but that attacking midfield role is the best fit for his capabilities as he seeks to recapture his best form.",
      "Mount kept summer signing Matheus Cunha out of the side against Sunderland and having players of quality coming off the bench as game-changing options is something United have lacked in recent seasons.",
      "For Mount himself, there is a steely determination to showcase his talent this season as he seeks to help United erase the memories of a disappointing 2024-25 campaign which ended with a 15th place finish in the Premier League and a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "\"A lot of people have said a lot of stuff about us as a group, and we ball that up and we use that energy in the best way we can, and that's on the football pitch against other teams, and really competing and fighting for those three points,\" admitted Mount earlier this season.",
      "Mount was joined on the scoresheet against Sunderland by Sesko, who netted his second goal since his summer arrival.",
      "The Slovenia international is beginning to make his mark up front and if he can offer the consistent goalscoring threat that Rasmus Hojlund struggled to achieve last season, then United can reap the rewards.",
      "Hojlund has hit the ground running since departing United for Napoli but he managed just four goals for the Reds in the Premier League last season. If Amorim's men are to compete at the top end of the table, they will need a regular supply of goals from their centre forward.",
      "Sesko's early signs of fulfilling that brief are promising, and Amorim has been pleased with what he has seen from the 22-year-old.",
      "\"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game,\" he said. \"That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "The hard work will continue at Anfield on Sunday, Amorim will hope it yields a result.",

      "We're here to bring you all the latest Manchester United news, reaction, and opinion following Turki Al-Sheikh's claims that a businessman is in an 'advanced stage' of purchasing the club. The Saudi Arabian billionaire clarified his comments on Thursday evening, but the rumour mill continues to churn.",
      "There's also talk of interest from the UAE, according to reports, while Sheikh Jassim, who narrowly missed out on buying United not too long ago, could be back in the game. The Qatari banker had his sights set on a full takeover of the club, but the Glazers sold a minority share to Sir Jim Ratcliffe instead.",
      "In other news, Kobbie Mainoo remains heavily linked with a move away from United. The 20-year-old midfielder pushed for a transfer from Old Trafford in the summer, seeking more game time ahead of next year's World Cup, but his request was blocked.",
      "Agents have voted United's signing of Benjamin Sesko as the worst deal of last summer. Six of the 20 surveyed by The Athletic voted for the striker, double the number of James Trafford in second place.",
      "They were the only two players who received multiple votes. Antony and Jadon Sancho also received single selections.",
      "Wes Brown has refused to rule out Marcus Rashford staying at Manchester United rather than joining Barcelona permanently.",
      "Asked whether he sees any way back for Rashford at United, Brown said to 10bet Casino:",
      "It's a tough one. He's there for the season, and then nothing is guaranteed. I said before that I thought he would do well. He's got the mentality to succeed, and we'd need to see how it worked for him, and it's started really well so far.",
      "Would I bring him back? I can't say for sure, because it depends on what the manager wants next season, and it'll be up to him and the player. You can see, though, that Marcus is loving life in Barcelona, and when your life is good, your football is good. It's as simple as that.",
      "He's enjoying it, and I hope it carries on for him, regardless of the club he's at. If it was decided that he comes back to United and he's still in this form, then it's only a good thing.",
      "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has warned there is no pressure to consider offers for midfielder Adam Wharton.",
      "Manchester United are already planning to sign a new midfielder next summer. Casemiro's contract expires in June and the 33-year-old is set to depart the club on a free transfer.",
      "Wharton has emerged as one of Europe's finest midfield prospects over the last two seasons. The 21-year-old has delivered superb performances in defensive midfield for Crystal Palace, and starred in his side's FA Cup victory against Manchester City at Wembley last season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Kbbie Mainoo will return to Manchester United training today with renewed hunger to show boss Ruben Amorim he is worthy of a first Premier League start of the season.",
      "United's players not involved on international duty were given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, and told to report back for training to begin the build-up to the weekend trip to arch rivals Liverpool.",
      "Mainoo is among those United players not required by his country during the international break, an unthinkable scenario 16 months ago when he started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain.",
      "Read the full story here",
      "Barcelona's decision to sign Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal from Manchester United could reportedly become inevitable.",
      "The 27-year-old landed in Catalonia on a season-long loan in July after Reds boss Ruben Amorim made it clear he wasn't part of his plans. The Catalan giants have the option to make Rashford's move permanent for £30million in 2026.",
      "Following his impressive performances since the September international break, Barcelona are reportedly eager to secure the England forward, but are hoping for a bargain deal of around £26m. Rashford has three years remaining on his current contract at Old Trafford, which he signed in July 2023 after netting a career-high 30 goals for United in the 2022/23 season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka has ranked Bruno Fernandes ahead of Florian Wirtz and Cole Palmer when asked to order the trio based on quality.",
      "The Manchester United captain has continued to perform impressively despite a challenging few seasons for the club overall. Last season, he scored eight goals and provided 10 assists in the Premier League, while also netting seven times during United’s run to the Europa League final.",
      "Fernandes has occasionally faced criticism for his emotional reactions and leadership style since taking the armband at Old Trafford, but his numbers speak for themselves.",
      "Read more here",
      "Senne Lammens has admitted Manchester United's players have “everything to succeed” and can have no excuses for failure following the overhaul of the club's training complex.",
      "United spent £50million modernising the Carrington complex, situated half-an-hour's drive from Old Trafford, turning the tired training ground into a state-of-the-art facility.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating training facilities during his ill-fated second spell at United, which led to his acrimonious exit just before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have been told that Rasmus Hojlund is seen as one of Serie A's finest strikers.",
      "The 22-year-old forward made the move to Italian champions Italy on a season-long loan this summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds boss Ruben Amorim. Despite his initial desire to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place, even with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, it appears his decision to leave has paid off.",
      "Hojlund only found the back of the net four times in the Premier League for United last season, contributing to the club's disappointing 15th-place finish in the English top flight. However, in just six appearances across Serie A and the Champions League, Hojlund has already matched that goal tally under Napoli manager Antonio Conte.",
      "Read more here",
      "Senne Lammens had a bit of a shaky start on his first day at the Carrington Training Complex. The 23-year-old goalkeeper has already made a significant impact at Manchester United following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp, despite an initial hiccup.",
      "As reported by GiveMeSport, some members of the dressing room were 'strongly advocating' for the Old Trafford higher-ups to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. The 33-year-old goalkeeper was heavily rumoured to be moving throughout the summer after what appeared to be an emotional goodbye on the last day of the previous season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United news.",
      "It may be the international break but there's been plenty to talk about at Old Trafford over the past week or so. The takeover rumour mill has been in overdrive although claims from Turki Al-Sheikh have since been clarified.",
      "And the Reds are less than a week away from returning to action where they travel to rivals Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Stick with us throughtout the day for all the latest.",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog today.",
      "We will be back here tomorrow bringing you more of the latest news from Old Trafford.",
      "Until then, good night!",
      "Speaking to United In Focus, journalist Graeme Bailey has claimed that United have U-turned on Fernandes.",
      "Last summer, the club did not want to sell the midfielder.",
      "However, it is believed that the Reds' stance has now altered and talks have been held with Saudi Pro League clubs over a price.",
      "Bailey added that Fernandes is determined to decide his own future and not be forced out by those higher up.",
      "According to our colleagues at the Daily Mirror, Harry Maguire is ready to reject a whopping £500,000 per week contract offer from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The centre-back is out of contract at the end of this season but negotiations are underway to extend his stay in Manchester.",
      "Should United offer him a new deal, Maguire is believed to be keen to stay and would reject the Saudi millions.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with AS, Antony has insisted that a new signing at Old Trafford urged him to stay at the club.",
      "Explaining the situation, the winger said:",
      "Matheus Cunha wanted me to play there with him, but the situation was already very difficult. I have a lot of affection for him.",
      "Well, it is hard to argue with the fact that Zidane is one of the best head coaches in world football.",
      "His stock has only risen since being out of work and his next job will be chosen carefully.",
      "Whether he would choose United if offered the opportunity remains to be seen, but if Amorim was to ever leave United and Zidane was offered the job, I doubt there would be many, if any, Reds complaining.",
      "One name that seemingly always comes up when the United job is mentioned is Zinedine Zidane.",
      "As quoted by One Football, Zidane does not mention United as one of the priority jobs that he would like to take.",
      "For sure I’m returning to work as head coach, it’s my plan. My desire is to become France head coach one day. Let’s see. Me at Juventus? I don’t know why it didn’t happen. I always keep that team in my heart because it gave me a lot.",
      "According to The Independent, United will be needing to splash £70m if they are to convince Bournemouth to sell their talisman in the January transfer window or beyond.",
      "Unfortunately for the Reds, they are not the team in pole position to sign the forward.",
      "It is believed that Spurs are leading the way as they look to splash the cash to cement their place at the top end of the table.",
      "Speaking to BestBettingSites, via The Mirror, Chris Waddle has insisted that Bournemouth's talisman Antoine Semenyo would be perfect for United.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now. Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players. I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now. People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still. If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them. He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "While the Reds are keen on Wharton, there is a scenario where his current manager, Oliver Glasner, could join him at Old Trafford.",
      "Glasner has been linked with replacing Amorim should United choose to sack the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Currently, Ratcliffe is keen to stick with Amorim but could be tempted to U-turn if performances and results don't improve.",
      "Glasner is due to be a free agent at the end of this season but Parish has confirmed that talks have been held with the Austrian regarding a new contract.",
      "When asked directly about United's interest in Wharton, Parish was not shocked by that development.",
      "He continued on talkSPORT:",
      "If Manchester United want Adam Wharton, there's nothing surprising really about that. The fact of the matter is he's got a long contract to run. There's no pressure on us to do it, and I don't think there's any real pressure from the player either.",
      "That's according to Palace chairman Steve Parish who sat down with talkSPORT earlier.",
      "Speaking to journalists Henry Winter and Sean Custis, Parish was asked about the future of his talented midfielder.",
      "I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club. He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "According to our colleagues at the Sunday Mirror, United are planning a £60m move for Wharton in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed by United that an offer in that region will be enough to tempt Wharton to the Reds.",
      "The 21-year-old's current deal at Selhurst Park is due to expire in 2029.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United blog this Sunday afternoon.",
      "We are just a week away from United returning to action in the Premier League when they visit Liverpool.",
      "The clash will see two teams face each other who are both interested in the man below...",
      "Dylan James believes United could offer Crystal Palace a couple of player in exchange for Adam Wharton.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, a man once tipped to be the next best thing, does not get much game time anymore and requested a loan move during the summer for that exact reason. His loan request was blocked, so it's likely the 20-year-old will want to leave on a permanent transfer during the January window.",
      "Another player that United could offer up is Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee. Although he doesn't match Wharton's more deep-lying position in midfield, the swap offer could provide Palace with extra firepower behind Mateta.",
      "United will have to qualify for the Champions League just to stand a chance of signing Adam Wharton. Speaking on talkSPORT, Steve Parish revealed the midfielder's desire to play on the European stage.",
      "\"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club,\" said the Crystal Palace chairman.",
      "\"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace. He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get.",
      "\"I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from...\"",
      "According to The Sun, United will not consider Thomas Tuchel as an option if they sack Ruben Amorim. The report claims that the former Chelsea boss met with Sir Jim Ratcliffe shortly before the Reds axed Erik ten Hag.",
      "Tuchel was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford, but he took the England job and United opted for Amorim.",
      "According to Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, Roma have identified Joshua Zirkzee as a 'top target'. The report claims the Serie A outfit are also keen on Folarin Balogun at Monaco and Lucas Stassin at Saint-Etienne.",
      "According to the Mirror, Al-Nassr are prepared to offer Harry Maguire a contract in the region of £500,000-a-week. The Manchester United defender has recently entered the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, making him available on a free in the summer.",
      "The report claims Maguire could reject the proposal in favour of an extension at United. It's said that the 33-year-old has been 'seriously considering' the opportunity to play in the Middle East, given he's approaching the end of his career.",
      "The Mirror reckons that United are weighing up an offer of their own, with talks set to take place over the coming weeks. Maguire is reportedly aware that a move to Saudi could hamper his chance of extending his England career beyond the World Cup.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has explained just how close United were to signing Viktor Gyokeres ahead of Arsenal in the summer.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, the journalist said: \"At some point Sporting were insisting and pushing to offer Gyokeres to Man United and to get the deal done for less money from Man United than Arsenal in terms of fixed fee, but with better bonuses.",
      "\"United were ready to make the deal. For United it was okay, but the problem was always the player. Gyokeres, with all respect for Man United, wanted to go to Arsenal and made this desire very clear.",
      "“So Gyokeres didn’t want to move to Man Utd and Gyokeres’ dream was Arsenal. But Sporting were pushing like crazy. But Gyokeres decided to wait, to resist, to be patient and then to join Arsenal as he wanted to do...\"",
      "According to the Daily Star, Ruben Amorim is a 'huge fan' of Adam Wharton, and he's told United officials to secure his signature. The 21-year-old midfielder has been heavily linked with a few teams following his impressive performances for Crystal Palace.",
      "The report claims United believe a bid in the region of £60m would be enough to strike a deal with the Eagles, despite having previously priced Wharton at £100m."

      "Joshua Zirkzee had the potential to become a Manchester United cult hero after overcoming adversity.",
      "Zirkzee dealt with the embarrassment of being hooked against Newcastle after 33 minutes last December and showed tremendous character in bouncing back over the subsequent weeks.",
      "The Dutchman was an entertaining watch after being switched to one of the No.10 roles. Zirkzee was signed to play as a striker, but it was obvious that he did not possess the skillset to lead the United attack.",
      "United fans rooted for Zirkzee to come good after the Newcastle substitution, although he was demoted in the squad this summer when Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha arrived.",
      "Zirkzee has found opportunities hard to come by this term. Mbeumo and Cunha have been the first choice picks in the No.10 roles, while Mason Mount, Amad and Bruno Fernandes can also play there.",
      "Ruben Amorim has not started Zirkzee once, even naming him on the bench against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round. United have fewer fixtures this term and Zirkzee's chances of playing have been damaged by the early Carabao Cup exit and the failure to qualify for European football.",
      "He has recorded just 82 minutes across four appearances from the bench against Grimsby, Burnley, Manchester City and Brentford, but his current situation is not a surprise.",
      "It was predictable that Zirkzee would slip down the pecking order and become a peripheral squad member, given United's summer signings and failure to qualify for Europe.",
      "The extent of Zirkzee's demotion might be a tad surprising, though. He made positive contributions from the bench last season, but he's practically been forgotten about just months into the 2025/2026 campaign.",
      "Zirkzee will be concerned about his lack of involvement and it's not a surprise that reports linking him with a move away from Old Trafford in the January transfer window.",
      "The forward is aware that he must play to have a chance of making the Netherlands squad for the 2026 World Cup. Zirkzee has no chance of making Ronaldo Koeman's squad if he stays in Manchester.",
      "West Ham have been linked with a move for the Dutchman, while a return to Italy to represent Roma has also been touted, and an offer from the latter would be more attractive to the player.",
      "Zirkzee impressed during his time with Bologna in Serie A and only needs to look to his former teammate, Rasmus Hojlund, to decide why a return to Italy might be the best move for him.",
      "Hojlund has enjoyed a new lease of life since joining Napoli on transfer deadline day, scoring four goals in six appearances.",
      "The problem for Zirkzee is that although a move away in January makes perfect sense for him, does it make sense for United? He might not have started a game but he is seen as an important squad member.",
      "United are a stroke of bad luck away from needing Zirkzee and Amorim will want to keep him for the remainder of the campaign, which could end his chances of playing at the World Cup.",
      "There could be a standoff between both parties in January and it will be fascinating to see how it develops, as United pay Zirkzee's wages and ultimately have the power in discussions.",
      "Zirkzee finds himself in a similar situation to Kobbie Mainoo, who is desperate to play at the World Cup for England next summer. Clubs must dread a World Cup season because players are more likely to rock the boat in an attempt to secure a move for the sake of regular minutes.",
      "It's understandable that Zirkzee and Mainoo could request to leave for the sake of game time. Whether those requests will be entertained is another matter.",
      "United must be sympathetic to their situations, while also prioritising the club's interests.",

      "The striker joined Serie A champions Napoli on a season-long loan this summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds head coach Ruben Amorim. Despite his initial wish to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place, even with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, it seems his decision to leave has been vindicated.",
      "Hojlund only managed to find the back of the net four times in the Premier League for United last season, contributing to the club's disappointing 15th-place finish in the English top flight. However, in just six appearances across Serie A and the Champions League, Hojlund has already matched that goal tally under Napoli boss Antonio Conte.",
      "And the forward has now shared an update on social media while on international duty with Denmark. The 22-year-old has scored twice during the current October internationals.",
      "\"A wise man once said: \"Goals are like ketchup. Once they come, they keep on coming,” he said on Instagram.",
      "Hojlund's post has received likes from Denmark and Reds teammates Patrick Dorgu, former United player Christian Eriksen and Mbeumo.",
      "Meanwhile, Denmark boss Brian Riemer has aimed a thinly veiled dig at United over Hojlund's form for Napoli. On whether Hojlund can still succeed in England, Riemer said, via TipsBladet: \"I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion.",
      "\"Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that.",
      "\"But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.\"",
      "He added: \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It is more important than which league you play in.\"",

      "United played Kaizer Chiefs home and away during their 2008 pre-season schedule, drawing 1-1 in South Africa and winning 4-0 at Old Trafford just a week later to win the 'Vodacom Challenge'.",
      "The U21s have made a brilliant start to the new campaign and sit top of the Premier League 2.",

      "Wes Brown has claimed that Marcus Rashford could well end up staying at Manchester United rather than joining Barcelona permanently, with \"nothing guaranteed\" over his future.",
      "The Catalan club have an option worth £30million should they want to make the loan move permanent next summer. Aston Villa also had the opportunity to sign the England international at the end of last season's loan for £40million, but did not take up that chance after missing out on Champions League football.",
      "That price is now a guaranteed £25million for Barcelona, with the remaining £5million contingent on add-ons. United, however, would receive a share of any future sell-on fee.",
      "After scoring three goals and assisting five more across ten appearances in the Champions League and La Liga, the Catalan club are said to be keen on signing Rashford permanently. Brown also believes that the player is loving life in Barcelona and hopes that he continues to enjoy his football again, wherever that may be.",
      "Asked whether he sees any way back for Rashford at United, Brown said to 10bet Casino: \"It's a tough one. He's there for the season, and then nothing is guaranteed.",
      "\"I said before that I thought he would do well. He's got the mentality to succeed, and we'd need to see how it worked for him, and it's started really well so far.",
      "\"Would I bring him back? I can't say for sure, because it depends on what the manager wants next season, and it'll be up to him and the player.",
      "\"You can see, though, that Marcus is loving life in Barcelona, and when your life is good, your football is good. It's as simple as that.",
      "\"He's enjoying it, and I hope it carries on for him, regardless of the club he's at. If it was decided that he comes back to United and he's still in this form, then it's only a good thing.\"",

      "Following his impressive performances since the September international break, Barcelona are reportedly eager to secure the England forward, but are hoping for a bargain deal of around £26m. Rashford has three years remaining on his current contract at Old Trafford, which he signed in July 2023 after netting a career-high 30 goals for United in the 2022/23 season.",
      "And Spanish publication Estadio Deportivo claim that Barcelona's decision to sign Rashford on a permanent deal could become inevitable if he maintains his current form.",

      "\"It's not always easy, he came from another league. He is adapting well.\"",

      "\"We will see. I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is ensuring that he remains at his peak physical condition during the October international break.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, it has been difficult for Mainoo to insert himself into his plans. Amorim has already made it clear that the Stockport-born midfielder is in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes for a place in his starting XI which has hindered his minutes.",
      "Mainoo has played in the more advanced No.10 role but since the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, the 20-year-old has struggled to find a place their too. A lack of minutes this season led to the midfielder requesting a loan move away from Old Trafford.",
      "With the World Cup on the horizon at the end of the season, Mainoo needs to be playing to stand a chance of making Thomas Tuchel's squad. However, Amorim rejected the request from Mainoo, insisting that he needs him to stay as part of his squad.",
      "Despite this, Mainoo has still yet to start a match for United in the Premier League and the topic of a transfer move is bound to return when the January window opens. But if the midfielder is frustrated at Old Trafford, he has ensured his professional standards remain.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "During the October international break, Mainoo jetted off to Marbella to prepare for the Premier League's return. Whilst in the heat of Spain, Mainoo has continued to train on the pitch and in the gym.",
      "The midfielder also posted pictures of himself in the gym with the caption 'blessed'. From Amorim's perspective, it will be pleasing to see Mainoo sticking to his professionalism.",
      "As for the midfielder, he will be hoping that his time does come sooner, rather than later. United return to Premier League action on Sunday afternoon when they visit Liverpool.",

      "Ruben Amorim's appointment near enough sealed his fate with the new system at United not conducive to wingers. By January, Amorim had sealed a loan move for Antony to Real Betis and this managed to revitalise his career.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",

      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Read the full report here.",

      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United are being linked with a ‘shock’ £60m Manchester United transfer that’s no ‘shock’ at all.",
      "And it’s been given the ‘green light’ by Jack Grealish.",
      "",
      "Raise your hand if you are remotely shocked that Manchester United are being linked with Adam Wharton?",
      "Even regular readers of Football365 would not be surprised; we reported interest in August and then again in September, when we laughed off suggestions that the Crystal Palace and England midfielder could cost just £60m.",
      "The only shock at the weekend reports of a £60m Wharton deal is that Daily Star Chief Sports Writer Jeremy Cross has the gall to call this an ‘exclusive’. It’s either cheeky as f*** or incredibly lazy as ‘Wharton to Man Utd’ is more olds than news.",
      "We’re told in the headline, sub-headline and opening line that it’s a ‘shock £60m raid’. To who? To Cross? Certainly not to us or anybody else paying attention over the last two months.",
      "Amorim believes Wharton has the technical abilities to be a huge success at United. Palace have not been opposed to selling some of their biggest names, if the price is right.",
      "And United believe a bid in the region of £60m would be good enough to lure Wharton to Old Trafford next summer.",
      "Well they can ‘believe’ all they want, but genuinely…will it balls.",
      "The irritating thing about this ‘exclusive’ is not necessarily that Cross is claiming an ‘exclusive’ on an old story, but that other outlets blindly follow suit, with The Sun saying that ‘MANCHESTER UNITED are reportedly plotting a shock £60million bid for Adam Wharton’.",
      "Literally three days before, they published a piece that said ‘Wharton has long been on the radar of United, Manchester City and Liverpool’. So it’s not a sodding ‘shock’ is it?",
      "Goal also call it a ‘shock’ move because where one leads, everybody follows like click-thirsty sheep.",
      "Obviously, since reports of this ‘shock move’, Palace chief Steve Parish has made it clear that Wharton has shown no interest in moving to another club, while telling talkSPORT: “I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club. He’s an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can’t speak for Adam, but I think he’s focused on his time at Crystal Palace.”",
      "Put that through the Reach spin machine at the Mirror and…",
      "Adam Wharton issues Man Utd transfer demand as Crystal Palace star eyed",
      "Adam Wharton has said f*** all. Hell, even Parish says that Wharton has said f*** all. He definitely has not ‘issued Man Utd transfer demand’. In fact, some would say he has done exactly the opposite.",
      "",
      "The phrase ‘green light’, when not referring literally to a green light, means ‘permission to go ahead with a project’. Councils give green lights to planning applications, company directors give green lights to budgets, and in football terms, sporting directors give green lights to transfers.",
      "You know what you absolutely need to give a green light? Control over the lighting system. If you have no power, then you cannot give permission.",
      "Which brings us to the Mirror and this monstrosity of a headline:",
      "Jack Grealish has already given Man Utd green light for huge transfer",
      "Now, Grealish is an excellent footballer but he is not a sporting director at Manchester United so he cannot give the ‘green light’ to a ‘huge transfer’, unless he is the player in question. Which is presumably what we are supposed to think, that United are interested in the Everton loanee and Grealish has understandably given the deal an enthusiastic thumbs-up.",
      "Obviously we know that to be bollocks, so which ‘huge transfer’ has been given the ‘green light’ by a party with absolutely no power to make a decision?",
      "If Manchester United are looking for more reasons to sign Adam Wharton next summer, Jack Grealish has given them one. That’s after the Everton winger came out firing in his admiration of the Crystal Palace midfielder.",
      "FFS.",
      "So the ‘green light’ given by Grealish to a huge Manchester United transfer is that he described Wharton as “the best player on the pitch” when the two teams met eight days ago.",
      "That’s not a ‘green light’ to a transfer; that’s one footballer admiring the work of another footballer.",
      "This was not ‘a glowing review to any potential suitors – including United’; this was one footballer admiring the work of another footballer.",
      "Yes, it’s the international break. But does that mean we have to pretend Jack Grealish is about to join Manchester United? Now that would be a ‘shock’…",
      "It’s a very slow day in the Mailbox but a man’s AITA Reddit-style question from Sunday has had a vociferous response.",
      "Even with a whopping 48 teams taking part in the World Cup, there are still some of the best players in the world at risk of missing out.",
      "Manchester United have supposedly been dealt a ‘double blow’ regarding Adam Wharton and Oliver Glasner, but it’s actually only one ‘blow’…",
      "England fans being bored and quiet is probably preferable to the kind of mindless violence we have seen for decades.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona ‘will trigger’ their option to sign Marcus Rashford permanently from Manchester United next summer.",
      "As the World Cup in 2026 looms, we look at the records destined to fall in North America as 48 teams gather for an extravaganza."

      "Fair to say the peril for these guys still ranges from ‘mild’ to ‘extreme’ to ‘confirmed’ and there’s plenty still to keep an eye on across the next international breaks in November and March.",
      "You can check out how World Cup qualifying for the new expanded 48-team tournament works here, because in lots of places it’s now very different to how it was before.",

      "But the main point here is that right now all of them are at serious risk of missing the World Cup, with Sweden already looking mighty relieved to have that Nations League-based safety net to get them into the play-offs because they sit forlornly right at the very bottom of their qualifying group at the halfway stage, eight whole points behind perennial qualifiers Switzerland and three behind second-placed Kosovo.",
      "",
      "Having cited ‘mental tiredness’ as he made himself unavailable for June’s international break, Poland’s talisman was replaced as captain by coach Michal Probierz. Lewandowski’s response was to say that he would not play for Poland again until the coach was sacked.",
      "A damaging 2-1 defeat to Finland on the back of the Lewandowki spat meant that by the time the September internationals came along, Probierz was gone and Lewandowski was back for an impressive 1-1 draw in Holland secured by Matty Cash’s late equaliser.",
      "A 3-1 return win over Finland means fears of missing out altogether have now eased, but even a win over Netherlands in the next international break is unlikely to save them from what will be tricky play-off routes in which 16 entrants of assorted quality are whittled down to four qualifiers.",
      "",

      "The problem is that Belgium are blessed with attacking talent in De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku, Jeremy Doku, Leandro Trossard and Youri Tielemans, but they have Wout Faes at the back. What a shame if the Manchester City legend bows out of international football with a failed qualifying campaign.",
      "They may still win their group and avoid the hassle of the play-offs but unlike their rivals Wales and North Macedonia – the three teams are currently separated by just two points – the Belgians have no Nations League escape route into the play-offs.",

      "Having gone up another level following his move to PSG and swift treble glory inside six months, Kvaratskhelia is now well established among the very best players in the world.",

And if they win the play-offs it only gets them to… another play-off – the intercontinental ones that will decide the final two qualifiers in March.",

Galatasaray striker and Liverpool mini-crisis contributor Osimhen is perhaps the biggest global star from a squad that has underperformed badly to trail Benin and South Africa with just one match to go to try and salvage the situation, but he is far from alone. Alex Iwobi, Wilfrid Ndidi, Ademola Lookman, Ola Aina and Kelechi Iheanacho have all been involved.",

      "Manchester United have supposedly been dealt a ‘double blow’ regarding Adam Wharton and Oliver Glasner, but it’s actually only one ‘blow’…",
      "Crystal Palace are earning admiring glances from many clubs in Europe, including Manchester United, for their sensational rise under Glasner.",
      "The 2024/25 FA Cup winners have gone from strength to strength this season despite losing Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise in recent windows, with Glasner’s side sitting sixth in the Premier League after seven games.",
      "However, problems lie ahead for Crystal Palace, who are at risk of losing more key assets in 2026.",

      "Unsurprisingly, Man Utd have been thrown in the hat for Wharton and Glasner, though Palace chief Steve Parish has moved to reassure supporters that their futures could lie with the London club.",
      "The Sun have sold this as a ‘double blow’ for Man Utd and I’m about to explain why that is a bit of a stretch…",
      "Firstly, they have a fair point on Wharton as he “will want to play in the Champions League”, thus making a move to rivals Liverpool far more likely at this stage.",
      "“Look, I think Adam at some point will want to play, either in the Champions League with us, if we could make that happen, or probably with another club,” Parish said.",
      "“He’s an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can’t speak for Adam, but I think he’s focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "“He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had, which a lot of young players get. This season he’s completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us. I think he’s very committed to the club.",
      "“I mean, if Manchester United want Adam Wharton, that’s nothing surprising really. The fact of the matter is he’s got a long contract to run. There’s no pressure on us to do it and I don’t think there’s any real pressure from the player either.”",
      "The other supposed ‘blow’ for Man Utd is that Parish and Glasner have held talks over a new contract.",
      "“We would love to keep Oliver. We’re building something. I think for Oliver, it’s about the conditions being right,” Parish added on “early conversations” with Glasner.",
      "“It’s about everything being in a way that he enjoys his work, and he finds the conditions favourable to achieve.",
      "“Oliver wants to win things. He makes no secret of that. He’s in football for those days where we give all that pleasure to the fans. And we do as well.",
      "“So, if we can align those interests, then hopefully we can make something happen.”",
      "In reality, these “conversations” mean very little as they certainly do not mean that Glasner will sign a contract extension at Palace beyond next summer.",
      "Glasner “wants to win things” and as good as Palace have been over the past couple of years, he will look elsewhere to give himself a far greater chance of achieving that goal.",
      "It has also been reported that Glasner is “set” on the Man Utd job as Ruben Amorim remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "Should Glasner join Man Utd? Probably not, as there are other elite opportunities available as safer bets for the Palace boss.",
      "But football managers are nothing if not egotistical, and Glasner, who is riding the crest of a wave at Palace, would back himself to be the one to fix Man Utd, who proved in the summer that they can still attract their top targets to Old Trafford despite their prolonged period of misery.",
      "Manchester United are being linked with a ‘shock’ £60m Manchester United transfer that’s no ‘shock’ at all.",

      "Djibril Cisse hit back at those accusations from Rooney last week and insisted it was understandable that he celebrated with compatriot Samir Nasri as both teams had achieved something with QPR staying up.",
      "Cisse told FourFourTwo: “I’m not going to take this accusation any longer. I was celebrating with Samir Nasri.",
      "READ: England fans not behaving like insane headbangers is a plus, Tommy Tuchel",
      "“I didn’t celebrate with Mario Balotelli, Sergio Aguero or anybody else. I celebrated with my brother, Samir, who had been a friend of mine for 15 years.",
      "“I was happy for my friend and also that we managed to stay up. I don’t care about Man City. My friend finally won the Premier League after many years in England and I was happy for him and also for me. That’s all.”",
      "Barton, who made a fool out of himself after being sent off, got involved in the debate after Cisse’s comments, he began: “There’s been a bit of a spat online between Djibril Cisse and Wayne Rooney. Rooney has said that the game was bent and that QPR threw that game.”",
      "On Man Utd legend Rooney, Barton added: “I’m only commenting on it because he referenced me in it. Half of our team knew we were safe and stayed up and half of our team didn’t. You can see when you see it.",
      "“Five or six of the team did. I can hear it getting shouted from the sidelines. We had all been in City’s academy. You had Nedum Onuoha, Shaun Wright-Phillips and myself. So we would have wanted Manchester City to win the league over Man United, make no bones about that.",
      "“But at the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people’s results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",
      "“I have to disagree with Wayne. Wayne is trying to say that this game is some kind of bent fixture, that the lads had given up. He does say Paddy Kenny has basically thrown the two goals in that lead to City winning the league. I don’t think Paddy knew.",

      "He then ramped up the expletives, Barton continued: “So Wayne, and the other Man United fans – and I know loads of Man United fans have come up and asked me – no. I got told by Bobby Zamora to get someone sent off, so I tried. That’s where the book stops with me.",
      "“Your conspiracy theories, Wazza, are untrue. Sometimes people tell you stuff in life and you want to believe it because it fits your narrative and you want to have that cognitive dissonance.",
      "“It might be the same fellas who were saying that if you get one more hair transplant it might come back. This might be the time you get a fringe. As you found out, that is complete nonsense.",
      "“Stop wasting your time on nonsense. The game at Man City was not thrown. Man City won the league, Man United never. Am I happy about that? Abso-f***ing-lutely, because I hate Man United. But I didn’t go out my way to make City win the league.",

      "“You should have got yourselves in a better position. You didn’t. Man City had to beat QPR on the last day of the season at home, who were in the bottom four. That’s your fault.",
      "“The fact he’s even had a sniff of winning the league is a testament to the lads at QPR and the battle they put up, because that was an easy f***ing win for City.”",
      "Barton finished by adding: “QPR stayed up, happy days. City won the league, happy days. And you ****s were all crying on the pitch at the f***ing Stadium of f***ing Light or Middlesborough or wherever you was, which is f***ing triple whammy. Get f***ed.”",

      "In the summer, after last season’s 15th-placed Premier League finish, Fernandes was offered huge money to ditch the Red Devils in order to move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "He said at the time that he did not want to leave, but if United were willing to sell, he’d part ways with them.",
      "United decided against letting him go, but it seems the chances of a move to the Saudi Pro League are more likely, per insider Bailey.",
      "He told United In Focus: “Bruno Fernandes has made it clear to Manchester United that he will not be pushed out of the club, hence his quotes about the Saudi Pro League.",
      "“Fernandes considered the Saudi Pro League last summer, but both the player and United were not keen. Since then, things have changed. Sources confirm that United have indeed held talks with the Pro League about Fernandes.",
      "“However, Fernandes – as we know – has not put the brakes on this by publicly stating his stance.",
      "“It is clear Fernandes will decide his own future.”",
      "That there have been talks between United and the Saudis for Fernandes is something of a shock. However, they know they’d make good money from the midfielder’s sale, the current regime is not using him in a way which best suits his game, and that’s seen him struggle for form – with just two goals and no assists this term.",
      "Fernandes has recently cleared the air on his reasons for staying at United, saying: “I didn’t close the door to move to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup — that was never on my mind. I just wanted to stay at the club, and the club wanted me to stay. That’s all.”",
      "Given the suggestion that United have held talks over Fernandes’ sale, it seems they might no longer want him to stay, and as that was one of the main drivers of him remaining at the club last summer, his view might soon change.",

      "United spent around £170million in the summer, largely on attacking talents. Of their five signings, three – Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo – play in the attack.",
      "Sesko has scored twice in the Premier League, Mbeumo once, while Cunha is yet to get off the mark.",
      "The nine goals scored by United in the league this season is fairly middling, and they are ninth in the table as a result.",
      "Waddle feels that to take the next step, though they have just signed three attackers, one more needs to come in, and he has named that man.",
      "Waddle said: “Antoine Semenyo, the winger at Bournemouth, is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now.",
      "“Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players.",
      "“I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now.",
      "“People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still.",
      "“If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them.",
      "“He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "“You could see a real team developing, especially with Bruno Fernandes in behind. There’s a lot more to do, but I can see them building a team there.",
      "“He’s the type of player that United fans would love, and it would be a great acquisition, but he won’t come cheap.”",
      "Waddle’s suggestion that Semenyo could play in attack with Cunha and Sesko would mean there was no space for Mbeumo, and that would be a surprise given he’s had more impact than Cunha so far this term.",
      "It is conceivable that Semenyo would leave Bournemouth for United, as Cunha and Mbeumo were both at similar stature teams – Brentford finished above United last season – but still joined them.",
      "But he’ll have seen that neither is having the same impact there, and for a player with six goals and three assists in seven Premier League games this season, he won’t want to risk becoming less impactful by making a move to the wrong side.",

      "A Serie A giant chief has reportedly drawn up an ‘intriguing idea’ to land a Manchester United attacker who is said to be ‘deeply frustrated’ at the moment.",
      "United’s attack left a lot to be desired last season. In the Premier League, none of their players surpassed 10 goals, and central strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scored four and three goals respectively, though both played north of 30 games.",
      "Over the summer, it was reported that United were looking to ship out Hojlund, though Zirkzee would be safe. That was despite the former wanting to stay at United.",
      "He was indeed shipped out, to Napoli, but while Zirkzee survived, things have not panned out how they might have.",
      "The Dutchman has played just 82 minutes in all competitions this term, with new signing Benjamin Sesko preferred up top of late, while Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount have also been given minutes there.",
      "Amid his struggles for playing time, Gazzetta dello Sport reports Dan Friedkin and Gian Piero Gasperini at Roma have come up with the ‘intriguing idea’ of loaning Zirkzee in.",
      "The report states that the Dutchman ‘wants to leave’ in order to avoid the risk of missing out on the World Cup, having been left out of the Netherlands side of late.",
      "The report suggests that within the Premier League, West Ham and Everton also have Zirkzee in their sights.",
      "A recent report stated that Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Juventus and Como are looking at the United man, with the Hammers also mentioned.",
      "That, too, suggested that Zirkzee is not happy with his role at United. Indeed, it was said that he is ‘deeply frustrated’ by his current role, and a January move will be crucial if he’s to play in the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Ronald Koeman’s recent comments are a stark reminder of that.",
      "The Netherlands boss said: “He wasn’t in the preliminary selection because I don’t think he’s good enough at the moment.",
      "“Especially scanning when turning or passing often goes wrong. Yes, in principle form and fitness are always leading, but that is not always possible.",
      "“We have a lot of central defenders and midfielders, but we are somewhat limited up front.",
      "“But even then, I still think that you have to earn your selection, and I think he doesn’t deserve that now, but that could be the case again in another period.”",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee could be set for a move away from Old Trafford in January as he looks to make the World Cup, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly made a ‘shock U-turn’ on captain Bruno Fernandes after he was linked with a summer move to the Saudi Pro League.",

      "Thanks George for asking in the last mailbox. It’s been stressing me out a lot hearing how 3-5-2 doesn’t work for various reasons and Amorim and the players have no chance.",
      "I remember in the 90s when Roy Evans took over the Liverpool side and adopted a 3-5-2. Liverpool bought Mark Wright for £2.2m who was England’s centre back (Harry Maguire with pace and class). John Scales (De Ligt with fewer mistakes) and Phil Babb (Lenny Yoro) were the other centre backs.",
      "Left back was Stig Inge Bjornabye and Steve Harkness. Nothing world class but could tirelessly get up and down the whole game. Right back was Rob Jones who was superb and again could run and run. Dorgu seems like he knows what he is doing but neither Dalot or Amad are a good fit for that position which messes up the formation and attacking lines.",
      "Midfield we had John Barnes (Bruno Fernandes) but he was fat and old so he just sat at the back reading the game, intercepting, spraying lovely passes and getting a few goals. He was definitely not all over the pitch trying to do everything but falling on all counts and ruining the formation. Barnes also took a decent penalty without getting into a strop. His partner was a young Jamie Redknapp whose best achievement was marrying Louise (If you know you know). He was a decent player and put a shift in. The 2 of them screened the back 3 so we were pretty solid.",
      "Biggest difference in Utd and Liverpool was the front 3. Liverpool had Steve McManaman who was all over the pitch (where Bruno should play) and had the license to roam and create. Up front was Stanley Victor Collymore and Robbie Fowler. They got 55 goals between them one season and played as orthodox strikers. The team was built to get chances to the front 2.",
      "In my opinion (Geoff) with Cunha roaming and Mbeumo wide it only leaves Sesko in there who can be easily marshalled by the opposition defence. So the answer is simple. Bruno needs to be further forward with Cunha and Mbeumo as 2 orthodox strikers. Put De Ligt as defensive midfield with Mason Mount sitting in front of the back 3. Buy a right wing back.

      "The way media works now, the thirst for content and clicks, means the noise is just relentless and cacophonous. Ex-players turned pundits clipped up endlessly, a steady stream of podcasts, dedicated content creators with millions of followers, plus all the papers and other news sites. They are the biggest story in town. Everyone either supports them or despises them.",

      "Hi there,",
      "Peter Bowler would have us believe that taking down a flag is “disrespectful and insulting under any circumstances.” This is a view so original and refreshing that I would like to interrogate it further. Does Mr Bowler believe that every flag, once erected, must stay up forever? Would they not get fairly tatty?",
      "This flag, in particular, was on some scaffolding on a building site owned by Gary Neville. Does this mean the scaffolding has to stay up on the property until the end of time, long after the construction is concluded, for fear of disturbing the precious flag that has been tied to it? Does he know how much scaffolding costs? Has he not been following the news about steel shortages? Won’t he think of the impact on the construction industry?",
      "Could the wondrous, beauteous Union Flag, a symbol of peace, justice and love worldwide, become like one of those endangered newts? Could environmentalists stop developments on, say wetlands, by the expeditious method of tying a flag to them, therefore rendering areas of natural beauty inviolate until the VERY END OF TIME ITSELF?",
      "IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT MR BOWLER? YOU HAVEN’T THOUGHT THIS THROUGH AT ALL!\nDara O’Reilly, London",
      "",
      "‘Peter Bowler’ – a flag isn’t representative of this nation at all. It’s just a bit of fabric with some colours on; it is a symbol, and as with every symbol its meaning comes from how it’s used and who by. What it represents can change at the drop of a (Bowler) hat. 30 years ago, if I’d started tying flags to lampposts showing the colours of the rainbow, most people would have assumed I was in favour of leprechauns, or Teletubbies, or Zippy and Bungle, etc. What’s that idiot doing up a ladder with that flag? He must really like Dark Side of the Moon to go to all that effort.",
      "Who knows? Whereas in 2025, everybody knows what it means. Similarly, Hindus had a symbol that stood for prosperity for the business end of about 5,000 years. And then it didn’t, when about a century ago, the swastika started to mean something *very* different to most people.",
      "Or to take the Union ‘flag’ (Union Jack is not just a naval term btw): back in the day, nobody saw The Jam ponceing about in Union Jack blazers and thought, blimey, that Paul Weller is such a fascist. Between the cor blimeying and bloody door blowing of The Italian Job, did viewers think the football songs, flags, and red, white and blue Minis were the coming of the new Reich? Nobody saw Noel Gallagher playing a UJ guitar at the height of Britpop and thought, this is bad, it’s obviously jackboots next. Were we all watching Mo Farah, Jess E-H, Greg Rutherford wearing flags round their shoulders during their 2012 victory laps and screeching, will no-one rid me of these turbulent racists? I tell you what, that Roger Moore skiing off a cliff and opening a Union Jack parachute? Disgusting.",
      "But Morrissey waving the flag at Madstock, in front of screens of skinheads, singing ‘ironically’ about the National Front, “Life is hard enough when you belong here”, “I don’t think black and white people will ever really get on”, etc? Yes, most people realised something was very amiss at that point. Obviously, a lot of us – myself included – didn’t want to see it in his case, and quite merrily ignored the Asian Ruts and the Pregnant for the Last Times; but eventually you have to see what’s in front of your face. If Reform councillors get elected and immediately take down Pride flags – symbols of, more than anything else, a plea for tolerance and acceptance – whatever goes up in their place can only represent intolerance and exclusion. And what did they put up? The Gammon Bat Signal itself.",
      "There isn’t a symbolism committee that meets to decide these things; meaning is not handed down by Ed Miliband on giant stone tablets, we all just make it up as we go. Look up the word ‘literally’ in the dictionary to see that these things can get complicated. So, you can pretend the meaning of the flag isn’t changing, and you’re not changing it. Life may be easier psychologically if you tell yourself that the flag doesn’t mean anything deep; there’s no subtext to anything; flying the UJ is just a plain statement of fact – it’s just reminding people what country they’re in. On a par with tying a flag to a lamppost that says, this is a lamppost. What are people annoyed about? Nobody gets ‘triggered’ when they see place names on a road sign do they? What’s all the fuss about?",
      "But whether you know it or not, it’s reflecting you and your personality. It’s reflecting your actions in public and how you speak about the world. And if that flag is a big piece of cloth with your face on it, then fine – you get to own that, nobody else is involved. But if you’re telling everyone that this is their flag too, their country, and their values, the answer is No. Nobody asked us to sign up to how this is being used; nobody tying flags to railings and then pissing in the street straight afterwards asked for my opinion beforehand; nobody setting hotels on fire stopped to enquire if the people – be they white, middle-aged, angry or whatever else – are alright with this.",

      "“Some great teams over the years have played with a back-three. I’m not saying that’s my favourite formation at all, and I’m not saying that Amorim is right to be steadfast in his beliefs in that formation. But I certainly don’t think all of United’s problems now are because they play with the back-three.",
      "“It’s embarrassing if you’re going to say the main reason for the downturn is because they play a back-three. I mean, it really isn’t. They could go back to a back-four and play as bad as they did under Ten Hag, then the screams would be equally as loud.”",
      "Amorim has voiced his concerns that negative comments from pundits about his system might be influencing his players, and Owen thinks that is possible.",
      "“I could totally buy that,” he said. “Players aren’t sheltered away from everything.",
      "“They’re driving cars to training, putting the radio on. They sit at home in the lounge with the TV on. They read social media. They can do all these things. If you’re interested in football, you can’t get away from what people are thinking and saying about it.",
      "“Whether footballers should be swayed by those comments or impacted by them, that’s a different argument. But I’ve got no doubt that people will watch and will listen to people they probably respected and thought were great players growing up. They’ll listen to those opinions.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is under pressure after a mixed start to the season followed last term's 15th-placed finish; Man Utd's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has given him a huge vote of support: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "\"We all know how football works. Before the next international break, Man Utd have got four games, Liverpool, Brighton, Forest and Spurs.",
      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "\"What would journalists in Spain who cover Real Madrid or Barcelona be saying if Real Madrid finished 15th in the table? What would they be saying if their new manager was bottom of the table when it came to results since he'd taken over?\"",

      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",

      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",

      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "\"I'm telling you when we finish the game and you can see me, I don't care about my job. That hurt of not winning games or failing. That is the thing that hurts me the most.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"That is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard. It's so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, and something happens.",
      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",
      "\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.",
      "\"I see a lot of things that my wife is talking with the media. That is such nonsense.",
      "\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.",
      "\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.",
      "\"So my biggest problem is [if] my players believe in you guys when they say the problem of our team is the system.",
      "\"I get crazy about that because I can see the team, I see this team playing in a different system.",
      "\"We need to play the same way with the same power with the same intensity with the same focus. If you do that, the system doesn't matter.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.",
      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
