      "Michael Carrick will have to work with the players he has at Manchester(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have no plans to make any January signings this month despite the change in manager and their questionable form, which has seen their hopes of silverware ended.",
      "Huge investment was made in the summer with more than £200million spent on their frontline, bringing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha all to Old Trafford. That didn't help Ruben Amorim retain his job though and Michael Carrick has now been put in charge.",
      "The new man at the helm will be expected to work with the squad he has inherited in Manchester, reports ESPN, with the club having no desire to dip into the market this month.",
      "United are aware of their need to bolster certain parts of their squad, particularly the centre of midfield, which was a position Amorim wanted to strengthen. None of the team's targets are available currently and the hierarchy do not want to spend money on a short-term solution.",
      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba are all on their radar but neither of them will be sold by their clubs in January.",
      "It is also understood that any sale are unlikely with Joshua Zirkzee, who has been heavily linked with a return to Italy, staying put. There was a lot of noise around Kobbie Mainoo in recent months given his lack of game time, but he too is expected to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils lost to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, ending their last hope of a trophy. Their recent form has seen them win just once across their last seven games, that coming against Newcastle, but Carrick and his backroom will have to reinvigorate the current crop.",
      "Man United have been linked with Elliot Anderson, but he won't be moving in January(Image: PA)",
      "Those in charge at Old Trafford believe with players returning from injury and forwards Mbeumo and Amad Diallo set to be back from their stints at the Africa Cup of Nations that Carrick has enough depth and quality available to him to make something of the second half of the year.",
      "The new man at the helm, who was picked ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has been handed a baptism of fire with Manchester City heading to Old Trafford this weekend. After that the Red Devils face another difficult task as they head to league leaders Arsenal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick has made his thoughts clear on Kobbie Mainoo already(Image: Matthew Peters, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Newly appointed Manchester United manager Michael Carrick agrees with Sir Alex Ferguson that Kobbie Mainoo is the lifeblood of the club. Carrick, a former United midfielder, was confirmed as interim head coach on Tuesday until the end of the season.",
      "The 44-year-old steps into the dugout following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim last week, having previously held the reins at United for three games in 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked.",
      "It remains to be seen what United under Carrick will look like and how he will set the team up. However, his past interviews suggest out-of-favour youngster Mainoo could return to the starting XI.",
      "Mainoo enjoyed a meteoric rise at Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag, having graduated from the academy. He most notably played a pivotal role in their 2024 FA Cup triumph over Manchester City before becoming a fully-fledged England international.",
      "Yet, the Stockport-born midfielder found himself sidelined under Amorim, despite the latter's limited midfield options. The 20-year-old was reportedly considering leaving United but may now find a reprieve under Carrick, particularly given the manager's previous comments.",
      "In a conversation with fellow club legend Rio Ferdinand last year, Carrick was asked if he would build the midfield around Mainoo. Carrick responded: \"Yeah, I think for a club to have a player that’s come through the academy and knows the club and feels it… I think Man United’s got to have an element of that. It always has done and always should have.",
      "\"To have a talent like Mainoo, which he’s shown already, you’ve got to have players like that [in the team], players that you can say, ‘They get it. They know it. Let’s help them and stick with them’. I think there’s definitely a place for him there, for sure.\"",
      "His comments followed reports suggesting Mainoo had been exploring a summer move to Napoli, only for Amorim to block the transfer. Carrick's views echo those of legendary United manager Ferguson, who famously built his success around academy products like the Class of '92.",
      "The Scottish icon emphasised that homegrown talent was vital to United's DNA when asked about Mainoo and the now departed Alejandro Garnacho in 2024.",
      "Mainoo may get a second chance under Carrick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sir Alex told TikToker Jamal Niaz: \"It’s the foundation, isn’t it? It’s the heart and soul of what Manchester United has been since the days of Sir Matt Busby, who started the whole process of trusting young players playing.",
      "\"They’re young. What they’re showing at the moment, the composure and confidence to play in the first team, and not be daunted by it. In a way, it shows you the kind of courage they have. It’s a distinction in human beings, some have the will to be that [fearless at a young age].\"",
      "How Carrick plans to deploy Mainoo is yet to be seen, especially considering his previous comments to Ferdinand where he identified the youngster as an attacking midfielder. Carrick said: \"He's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has been hailed as the perfect choice for Manchester United's interim head coach by an ex-teammate. The announcement of Carrick's appointment for the rest of the season came on Tuesday, following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim after just 14 months in charge.",
      "Carrick will make a return to Old Trafford to guide the team, having previously served as caretaker manager in the 2021/22 season. The 44-year-old steps into the role with United currently sitting seventh in the Premier League, trailing fourth place by three points.",
      "Former United goalkeeper Ben Foster, who played alongside Carrick from 2006 to 2010, believes his composed demeanour makes him the ideal candidate for the job. This comes after United decided against offering the interim position to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"He [Carrick] is perfect for what they need right now. Whether it's long-term, I think that remains to be seen. The next four months of the season will tell us all we need to know.",
      "\"But for now, he's just nice and calm. He never gets too excited, never gets too carried away. He's the kind of person where you never really know what he's thinking, because he is so calm and he's always got it under control.",
      "\"I think that carries a weight of respect. With him going into that dressing room, I think the lads will look up to him a little bit.\"",
      "Carrick led Middlesbrough to the Championship play-offs as manager in 2022/23, but was dismissed in June 2025 following eighth and tenth place finishes. His primary objective at United will be to steer the club back into the Champions League for next season.",
      "Michael Carrick (L) and Ben Foster (R) pictured together during their time at Manchester United(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Recent history indicates this won't be an easy feat and Foster has also voiced his empathy for United's beleaguered squad after their FA Cup defeat to Brighton. It comes after the former Watford and Wrexham keeper highlighted the immense pressure players at Old Trafford are under.",
      "He said: \"I think it's the hardest club in the worl‎d to play for at Manchester‎ United. The attention that they get is so intense and unless you're mentally able to cope with all of the noise, then you're on the back foot from the get go.",
      "\"I've seen Man United sign players who are nine out of ten ability wise, and as soon as they put that red shirt on, it turns them into a six out of ten. The weight of it is so, so heavy.\"",
      "Ben Foster has expressed sympathy for the Man Utd squad after they crashed out of the FA Cup(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",

      "Carrick's reign will kick off with the Manchester derby this Saturday, followed by 17 Premier League matches where he'll aim to imprint his philosophy on the team.",

      "Mason Greenwood scored a hat-trick for Marseille on Tuesday(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The French media were left singing Mason Greenwood’s praises after the former Manchester United forward’s latest hat-trick for Marseille. Greenwood played the full 90 minutes of Tuesday's Coupe de France match, where Ligue 1 giants Marseille showed no mercy against sixth-tier side Bayeux, securing a 9-0 victory at the Stade Michel d'Ornano in Caen.",
      "Bayeux's decision to avoid a defensive set-up backfired spectacularly, bringing their impressive run in the tournament to an end. Roberto De Zerbi's team were never under threat, with another ex-United player, Angel Gomes, breaking the deadlock after just 13 minutes.",
      "After that, the goals came thick and fast, with Greenwood finding the back of the net in the 26th minute with a left-footed effort. The 24-year-old, who left United for good in July 2024, grabbed his second goal shortly after the break to make it 5-0.",
      "After setting up Amine Gouiri with a cross and then CJ Egan-Riley with a pinpoint corner, Greenwood rounded off his hat-trick with the final kick of the game. That secured him the match ball and took his season's goal tally to 19 in all competitions.",
      "Greenwood played a part in five of his side's nine goals(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Publication Ouest France highlighted Greenwood's dominant display, emphasising why he's become Marseille's most crucial attacking threat this campaign. They said: \"With a dazzling performance from Mason Greenwood, who scored a hat-trick and provided two assists, Marseille will face Stade Rennais in the round of 16.\"",
      "Ouest added: \"Facing Olympique de Marseille, nine-time French champions, the R1 amateurs were outmatched, suffering a resounding 9-0 defeat against a disciplined and focused team led by Roberto De Zerbi, exemplified by Mason Greenwood's hat-trick and two assists.\"",
      "Regional newspaper La Provence offered equally positive praise for Greenwood, awarding him a 7.5/10 rating on the night.",
      "They wrote: \"The Englishman strolled through the game. Promoted to captain at halftime, he had already opened his account with a lightning-fast counter-attack (26). He then converted a pass from Gouiri (49), before returning the favor (55). A hat-trick to finish (90).\"",
      "Greenwood's performance was described as 'dazzling'(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "French outlet Maxifoot took their praise a step further by crowning Greenwood as their man of the match, granting him an impressive 9.5/10 rating.",
      "Meanwhile, 90min France dished out a perfect 10/10 for Greenwood, highlighting his creativity in assisting teammates and his clinical finishing ability.",

      "His most impressive work came alongside Southgate at England, helping them reach two major tournament finals. They left their roles in the aftermath of Euro 2024 and Southgate hasn't had another managerial gig since.",
      "The former England boss has been linked with the job in Manchester in the past. He was championed by Dan Ashworth, formerly part of the hierarchy at Old Trafford, and Redknapp claims getting Holland could lead to Southgate eventually being appointed.",
      "Carrick will be the man making the decisions for now. He served as assistant to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then had three matches in charge after the Norwegian's sacking - going unbeaten in that time. His immediate remit will be Champions League qualification.",
      "\"I think it's a sensible appointment,\" said Redknapp. \"You talk about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who had done it before as an interim. He did well. I thought this is the more sensible one out of the two. I've met Michael and played against him. He's a student of the game. He knows the game inside out. I think he's just got to do his best to get them into the top four or five.",

      "Carrick, despite only being in charge until the end of the season, is among the favourites for the job at his former club. Despite only being a stop gap the club have shown that they will change course if results dictate. Solskjaer was only an interim in 2018 but his impressive form saw him land the job permanently.",

      "Manchester United's interim boss Michael Carrick could be in for an unexpected reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo in a move that could potentially bring in £10m for the club. The Sun reports that the Reds are considering a mid-season friendly in Saudi Arabia to help plug the club's financial gap, which would reunite the two United icons.",
      "It is suggested that a trip to Saudi Arabia could net around £10million, especially with only 17 matches left this season following their early FA Cup exit. The loss to Brighton marked the earliest United have been knocked out of both domestic trophies since the 1981-82 season.",
      "With no place in European football last year, the club is now set to play just 40 games this campaign, the fewest in a season for 111 years. Last season, United earned £160.3m in match-day revenue from 30 games, boosted by their journey to the Europa League Final, where they were ultimately defeated by Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Now, the club will host ten fewer games at Old Trafford this season compared to the previous one, with each game estimated to be worth approximately £5.3 million. Their FA Cup exit has created two gaps in the schedule when the fourth and fifth rounds of the competition are due to occur.",
      "This means United will have a 13-day break in February and a further 10-day hiatus in March before the international break. The newspaper reports that United have been in discussions with the chairman of the General Entertainment Authority of Saudi Arabia about a potential visit to the country.",
      "While it's not guaranteed that the club will end up visiting the Middle East, if they do, they could potentially face Ronaldo's Al-Nassr as part of the proposed plans for The Riyadh Season Cup. Carrick shared the pitch with the Portuguese superstar during the 2000s and later managed Ronaldo during his first stint as caretaker manager back in 2021.",
      "Michael Carrick was previously Manchester United's caretaker manager(Image: Action Images via Reuters)",
      "The Riyadh Season typically runs from October to March, and the aforementioned cup - a three-way tournament against Ronaldo's team and fellow capital club Al-Hilal - could be on the cards. United missed out on a whopping £100m in prize money after their defeat to Spurs in the Europa League Final last May, which resulted in a significant drop in match-day revenue.",
      "To counteract this shortfall, the club decided to increase ticket prices, with new executive seating in the lower South Stand at Old Trafford also introduced as a measure to offset any loss of income. The pre-season tour of Asia saw Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Co. rake in around £7.8million, while a trip to the US almost matched that figure a month later.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is backing Michael Carrick to be a success after his former coach was chosen to become Manchester United's new manager until the end of the season ahead of him.",
      "Solskjaer and Carrick quickly emerged as contenders to step in on a temporary basis after Ruben Amorim departed Old Trafford earlier this month. And it was the Norwegian, who managed United from 2018 to 2021 after initially impressing in an interim capacity, who was deemed by many to be the favourite for the head coach gig.",
      "While Solskjaer's previous experience in the hotseat had seemingly given him the edge, it became clear over the weekend that Carrick, after impressing in talks with the United hierarchy, was, in fact, more likely to land the role.",
      "The 44-year-old was subsequently formally appointed on Tuesday evening after further talks - and despite missing out on a second crack at the Manchester United job, there are seemingly no hard feelings on Solskjaer's part.",
      "BBC Sport claim that the former Red Devils striker 'wants' Carrick to make a success of the job, which is his until at least the summer. The report adds that Solskjaer views United's success as 'the most important thing' and feels Carrick will do an 'excellent job' at the helm.",
      "Carrick has been confirmed as Man United's manager until the end of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "While it is unclear what Solskjaer, who had not been planning an imminent return to management before being approached by United, will do next, the opportunity to oversee the remainder of the 2025-26 campaign is a big opportunity for Carrick, who was sacked by Middlesbrough back in June.",
      "The former United and England midfielder had been in charge of the Championship club for two-and-a-half years, overseeing 136 games. However, Carrick was axed after failing to guide Boro to a top-six finish.",
      "Fittingly, Solskjaer actually tipped Carrick - who was part of his Old Trafford coaching team - to be a future Manchester United manager back in 2023. “Michael is a man of value and principles, a big family man, but his knowledge is also second to none,” Solskjaer told The Athletic.",
      "“He’s had Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho as managers, and he’s played with the best players in the world. He’s a winner but he’s still in control of his emotions.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand knows who he wants to see in charge of the club next(Image: Rio Ferdinand Presents)",
      "Rio Ferdinand wants Manchester United to hire Roberto De Zerbi as their next permanent manager, after the former Brighton boss reportedly held secret negotiations with the Premier League powerhouse.",
      "Ferdinand's former team-mate, Michael Carrick, was unveiled as interim manager on Tuesday and will take the reins for the remainder of the season. However, the 2008 Champions League winner has a major task on his hands if he's to convince the board that he's the man to remain long-term.",
      "Instead, Ferdinand believes De Zerbi is the right man to permanently replace Ruben Amorim. It was reported De Zerbi rejected an offer from United prior to accepting his current job at Marseille, but Old Trafford icon Ferdinand reckons he could still make for a good fit.",
      "\"Someone who's free right now; not free [but] someone who's gettable,\" he said on Rio Ferdinand Presents while discussing potential permanent appointments.",
      "\"More than someone like [Thomas] Tuchel, because Tuchel would be one of my biggest picks as well, is De Zerbi. I'm telling you. Any formation he wants to play, the guy is a proper coach who gets players working and playing.\"",
      "Co-host Joel Beya interceded and gave his opinion that United \"don't want that,\" suggesting De Zerbi would \"flip his wig\" upon seeing the issues at United. For years, rumblings have escalated around behind-the-scenes issues at Old Trafford, from outdated training facilities to the need for a stadium upgrade, and that's without mentioning the in-house politics concerning the board.",
      "De Zerbi, 46, has reportedly had several fallouts with Marseille decision-makers. There was speculation last April that the Italian expressed frustration regarding the club's transfer ambitions, even threatening to leave if a certain level of commitment wasn't shown in securing reinforcements.",
      "He's also laid down the hammer by ejecting both Adrien Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe from the club last summer following a training ground bust-up. That's in addition to a video of him berating Ismael Kone and telling him to \"call his agent\" for ill discipline shortly before the youngster was loaned to one of De Zerbi's old clubs, Sassuolo.",
      "\"I'd bring fire to the party, I'm telling you,\" Ferdinand continued. \"I'd bring fire... I wouldn't bring craziness, but I'd bring [in] someone who's bringing that fire, that passion.",
      "Ferdinand has tipped Roberto De Zerbi for the United job after he reportedly held talks in the past(Image: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images)",

They can coach individuals, improve players and can really put down a way of playing football. I really do believe you need someone who is strong on their own identity.\"",
      "De Zerbi's Marseille were paving the way to a Ligue 1 title challenge earlier this season, backed up by a particularly fearsome home record. However, Les Olympiens have since slipped to third in the table and eight points off the lead after winning just one of their last four league games.",
      "It might please many United supporters to know De Zerbi mainly promotes a back-four system that many at Old Trafford have been yearning to see post-Amorim. However, the fiery attitude Ferdinand wants and that De Zerbi would inevitably bring may not be the solution United's board is seeking.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo paved the way for many others to make the move from Portugal to England(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "A Portuguese media outlet has criticised Manchester United, Arsenal, and Liverpool for the failure of several recent Premier League signings from Portugal. English football’s love affair with Portugal began two decades ago with the arrival of two men who would go on to become gargantuan figures in the sport - Jose Mourinho from Porto and Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting CP.",
      "The pair’s success at Chelsea and United, respectively, cultivated a new level of interest in both players and coaches plying their trade in the Iberian nation. A multitude of impressive talents have followed in their footsteps by making the journey from Portugal to English shores since, from Ricardo Carvalho and Nani in the noughties to Ruben Dias, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva and Wolves’ famous link to the country.",
      "While many have succeeded, it’s fair to say there have also been those who have failed to light up the Premier League, especially in more recent years. That appears to be slowly giving way to the idea that players who impress in the Primeira Liga don’t necessarily translate well to the more physically demanding and competitive Premier League, something the Dutch Eredivisie has also been accused of in the past.",
      "Now, an article by Portuguese publication A Bola, written by a journalist named Joao Pimpim, says the love affair is in danger of ending due to this rising belief. Three recent cases - Ruben Amorim, Viktor Gyokeres and Darwin Nunez - were offered as examples.",
      "Amorim restored Portuguese side Sporting to their former glory and was fast becoming one of the most coveted managers in the game when United appointed him in November 2024, splashing millions to end his contract and bring him to Old Trafford sooner.",
      "Yet, his results faltered, his tactics were constantly scrutinised, and he was sacked just 14 months later last week. His star striker at Sporting was Gyokeres, who scored the most goals last year in Europe and completed his own headline-grabbing £64million transfer to Arsenal last summer. But the striker has been a shadow of his former self in north London, scoring just one goal from open play in his last 15 top-flight appearances.",
      "Preceding both highly anticipated moves was the extraordinary case of Nunez. Regarded as one of the best forward talents in the world at Benfica, he was signed by Liverpool for £64m in June 2022 but spent three seasons looking lost at Anfield before his move to Al-Hilal last summer.",
      "Whether justified or not, all three have been branded flops by the media and fans, while the likes of Joao Felix, formerly of Chelsea, have also suffered a similar fate.",
      "Amorim was highly rated before his Manchester United tenure(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "However, the A Bola article has now pointed the finger back at English clubs for their involvement in those figures failing, rather than a lack of ability or talent.",
      "The key line from the piece reads: “It gives pause for thought, yes, but when there are stars shining at the highest level, such as Joao Neves, Vitinha, Nuno Mendes and Rafael Leao, is the problem with the selling market or... the buyers?”",
      "The players listed are all thriving at their respective clubs, PSG and AC Milan, who are both currently second in their domestic leagues. And the argument might well be justified.",
      "Amorim is just the latest in a long run of United managers (there have been 12 with Michael Carrick's appointment) to be brought in to steady the ship post Sir Alex Ferguson, only for their tenures to end in tears. With the chaos from top to bottom at the club, it is somewhat harsh to blame Amorim, though his man management and tactical rigidity rightly raised eyebrows.",
      "Gyokeres has been branded a 'flop' signing from Portugal(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "On the other hand, Nunez admirably and relentlessly worked to receive the ball in good positions for Liverpool, only to miss far more chances than he put away. Even so, he played his part in a title-winning campaign.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, has been given plenty of minutes by Mikel Arteta, but the team has largely refused to play to his strengths, with the striker rarely being played through on goal and losing confidence as a result.",
      "Time will tell whether the Gunners star will leave the Premier League before realising his potential like the aforementioned duo, though patience is already wearing thin and team-mates Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus are ready to take his position back.",
      "We will have to wait and see whether these 'flops' will lead to a greater reluctance in the future to shop from Portugal, or whether they are merely to be expected of the unpredictable nature of signings from abroad.",

      "Michael Carrick will take Man Utd through until the end of the season(Image: PA)",
      "Michael Carrick is Manchester United's new interim manager and will see the team through until the end of the season on an interim basis, just seven months after he was axed at Middlesbrough.",
      "His history at Old Trafford has served him well. The midfielder was part of Premier League and Champions League winning outfits, then served as an assistant under several different managers before having a three-game caretaker spell, where he went unbeaten.",
      "Carrick's return to the dugout is set to see United return to, what would be deemed, a more conventional style that lends itself to more of the players at Old Trafford. For over a year Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 formation has been a constant talking point.",
      "Its uniqueness and intricacies meant players were having to adapt to new positions, operating in ways they hadn't before in their careers. That is all set to change under Carrick, who laid out his stall when he was in charge at the Riverside Stadium.",
      "He had a huge initial impact, taking Boro from the depths of the table to the play-offs. Along the way he enhanced the careers of Morgan Rogers, now excelling at Aston Villa, and helped make Chuba Akpom the best player in the Championship, earning him a move to Ajax.",
      "As with any change in the dugout certain players win, others lose out. And with the change in system some individuals will see their roles change, Bruno Fernandes and the full-backs among the most obvious examples.",
      "Carrick employs a 4-2-3-1 formation, which should hopefully allow United's backline to adopt positions they're far more accustomed to. It means that ultimately two centre halves will miss out with Amorim previously playing with three. Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven and Matthijs de Ligt are set to be the five battling it out when they're all fit.",
      "Bruno Fernandes could be set for a return to a more attack-minded position(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "At Middlesbrough Carrick had a particularly effective left-back in Ryan Giles. He was give huge license to get forward, which saw the team adopt a back three in attack with the right-back tucking in.",
      "Whether he tries that is Manchester in unclear. The most attack-minded full-back they have is perhaps Patrick Dorgu, signed by Amorim as a wing-back. If Carrick wants to make best use of his full-backs it could be Dorgu who is given that license, although the likes of Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw have proved effective going forward.",
      "One of Carrick's biggest success stories was Akpom, who scored 29 times in all competitions in 2022/23 despite showing little sign he was set to be prolific. He operated as the team's No 10, often timing his runs effectively.",
      "Chuba Akpom was one of Michael Carrick's biggest success stories as a manager(Image: PA)",
      "The big winner here could well be Bruno Fernandes. He's had to adapt to more of a conventional central midfield role under Amorim, which has stunted him going forward. But Carrick's arrival could see him return as the playmaker. With Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Amad as wide options, the Portuguese star would have plenty to work with and has shown previously he can score with regularity.",
      "One problem Carrick will have to address, which was cited as an issue during his Middlesbrough stint, is that his team were vulnerable defensively. Championship managers commented on how they felt they could hit Boro on the break and achieve success, suggesting they could be got at in transition.",
      "Unfortunately for Carrick, he will not arrive in Manchester and find a ball-winning midfielder capable of breaking up play. Amorim's desire to add someone in that position was well documented, hence their reported interest in Brighton's Carlos Baleba in the summer.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will hope for more game time under Carrick(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are all options there, albeit all have their question marks. Having spent hours on the bench under Amorim Mainoo could see his United career reignited and, despite his age, he has the attributes of someone who could be elite in that position eventually.",
      "Carrick has already said on the academy graduate: \"To have a talent like that, as he's already shown, you've got to say: 'Right, he gets it, he knows it - let's help him, build on him, and stick with him. I think there's definitely a place for him.\"",
      "The former United star will surround himself with an impressive brains trust. Steve Holland, the ex-England assistant, is due to be his No 2. Carrick's most impressive exploits came immediately after he was hired by Middlesbrough, United will hope for the same.",
      "Man Utd possible line-up: Lammens, Dorgu, Martinez, Maguire, Dalot; Mainoo, Casemiro; Cunha, Fernandes, Mbuemo; Sesko",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The numbers don't make for great reading. All but two of the mistakes are missed interventions, up from seven to 11, when the VAR failed to suggest to the referee he should change his decision. Total overturns have dropped from 57 in 2024-25 to 47 this season - a fall of 17.54 per cent, reports the BBC",
      "The KMI Panel also catalogues on-field mistakes, which did not reach the clear and obvious threshold for VAR to intervene, and they are up from 12 to 15.",
      "The KMI Panel meets every week to dissect each decision. It has five members: three former players and coaches, plus one representative each from the Premier League and Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO). The idea behind it is to take performance stats out of the hands of the refereeing body.",
      "The decision about when - and when not - to send referees to the screen is still an issue(Image: Getty Images)",

      "The ball struck Marcos Senesi's arm but he then he made a deliberate act and batted it away just as Hugo Ekitike was about to run through on goal. The referee didn't show Senesi a card after claiming it was not foul play and when the VAR, on that occasion Michael Oliver, only looked at the first time the ball struck the arm.",
      "On-field vote: 1-4",
      "VAR vote: 1-4",
      "The panel's verdict: \"There is a secondary action by Senesi, where he moves his arm to flick the ball away, which is a handball offence. The majority feel that this was an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.\"",
      "The game was still awaiting its first when Josh King thought he'd put the visitors in front just after the 20 minute mark. Referee Rob Jones initially gave the goal but the VAR then flagged an incident between Rodrigo Muniz and Trevoh Chalobah in the build-up. It was deemed a foul, which stunned many, and the error led to the VAR, Michael Salisbury, being stood down from his next appointment.",

      "Hugo Bueno was fouled midway through the second-half when he was bought down following a challenge from Everton's Iliman Ndiaye. The Toffees were leading 3-1 at the time. Referee Michael Oliver allowed play to go on and the VAR, Craig Pawson, decided that there was not enough to suggest an on-field review.",
      "On-field vote: 1-4",
      "VAR vote: 2-3",
      "The panel's verdict: \"Bueno turns back into Ndiaye who does not make any contact on the ball. The contact made is careless and the panel felt that a penalty should have been awarded.\"",
      "Nathan Collins was only handed a yellow card despite pulling back ex-Bee Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to shoot inside the box. The defender had to pull back his opponent as he was put through on goal and referee Craig Pawson gave a penalty, but VAR, Andy Madley, did not think Mbeumo was in control of the ball, denying that it was a scoring chance. Brentford were 2-1 at the time with 20 minutes left - Bruno Fernandes would miss the penalty.",
      "On-field vote: 0-5",
      "VAR vote: 0-5",
      "The panel's verdict: \"There is an impactful holding action by Collins which is not an attempt to play the ball. Mbuemo is clearly prevented from having a clear shot at goal.\"",

      "It didn't change the end result, but at the time of the incident the game was still 1-1. Malo Gusto raised a foot to make a clearance, unaware that Yankuba Minteh was behind him. The Brighton winger went down holding his head, but referee Simon Hooper did think there was contact and VAR didn't jump in. The Seagulls scored twice in stoppage time.",

      "VAR actually did their job as the told referee Jarred Gillett to go to the screen, but even after having another look it was deemed that the wrong outcome was still reached. Gillett didn't think that Senesi should be sent off for a denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity after fouling Ismaila Sarr. The referee stuck by his decision to only dish out a yellow card.",
      "On-field vote: 3-2",
      "VAR vote: 3-2",
      "The panel's verdict: \"The majority felt that Sarr was very likely to gain possession with the ability to create an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"",
      "Dan Burn stood on the foot of Dango Ouattara and the Brentford star went down, but VAR Paul Tierney chose not to intervene. Brentford did get a penalty shortly afterwards for a clash between the same two players, but the extent of the contact meant that there was a split of opinion regarding whether the referee needed to review it.",
      "On-field vote: 0-5",
      "VAR vote: 2-3",
      "The panel's verdict: \"The panel were unanimous in their view that Burn commits a careless tripping offence. The panel were however split regarding the VAR outcome. Two members felt that the referee's call should stand as the contact was glancing.\"",
      "Bournemouth trailed West Ham 2-0 when they were given a route back in after being given a penalty in the 66th minute. Max Kilman had handled the ball when he was on the ground. Referee Thomas Bramall only showed a yellow card and VAR stood by that, but it was later deemed that the Hammers defender prevented Evanilson from having a shot.",
      "On-field vote: 0-5",
      "VAR vote: 1-4",
      "The panel's verdict: \"There is clear evidence that Kilman makes an additional movement with his arm to swipe the ball and in doing so this denies an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"",
      "The game was still without its opening goal when, after 17 minutes, Phil Foden released a shot but was was caught late by Fabian Schar. There is scope for defenders to have some leeway when it comes to blocks that turn into tackles, but the challenge was deemed reckless.",

      "On-field vote: 2-3",
      "VAR vote: 2-3",
      "The panel's verdict: \"Despite Foden getting a shot away, Schar makes a reckless foul challenge. Two panellists supported the decision as contact was a consequence of the momentum of the blocking action, and not clearly reckless.\"",
      "United secured a convincing win but in one incident Emmanuel Agbadou angled his body into the path of a shot to stop the ball. VAR Stuart Attwell chose not send referee Michael Salisbury to the monitor, but it was later confirmed that was the incorrect decision.",
      "On-field vote: 0-5",
      "VAR vote: 1-4",
      "The panel's verdict: \"Agbadou leans in towards the ball with a straight arm and his arm blocks the shot heading towards goal.\"",
      "Everton were losing 1-0 - which is how the game would end - when William Saliba and Thierno Barry went for a bouncing ball. Barry got there first and was kicked by the Arsenal defender. VAR Michael Salisbury, decided there wasn't enough contact to send referee Sam Barrott to the screen.",
      "On-field vote: 2-3",
      "VAR vote: 2-3",
      "The panel's verdict: \"A late challenge where Saliba carelessly kicks Barry with no contact on the ball. Two panellists supported the on-field no penalty call as they felt there was not enough impact and a delayed reaction.\"",
      "The Chelsea defender dodged giving a penalty away once again when, in the 54th minute Marcus Tavernier played a long cross to David Brooks, but Gusto jumped to head it and the ball landed on his outstretched arm. The VAR wrongly determined that the ball had hit the Chelsea ace too high on the arm for handball.",
      "On-field vote: 1-4",

      "The panel's verdict: \"The panel felt that the ball hit the 'red zone' of his arm that was raised in an unjustifiable position.\"",
      "Igor Thiago was sent through and he ran onto a pass before Tottenham's Cristian Romero making an attempt to intercept the ball. The defender made no contact on the ball and brought down the Brentford striker. The VAR felt there was no clear and obvious error in not giving the foul.",
      "On-field vote: 2-3",
      "VAR vote: 2-3",

      "Newcastle should have conceded an early penalty in their win over Manchester City, had Pep Guardiola's side gone ahead the result could've been very different and may yet have a bearing on the title race. Arsenal, Brentford and Everton benefited from VAR decision in games they won anyway.",

      "Michael Carrick was not afraid to make the big calls in his first spell with Man United (Image: Getty)",
      "Former Manchester United player and coach Michael Carrick made his impact felt in his short stint as interim boss after the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021. The ex-midfielder, 44, has been appointed United boss once again following the club's dismissal of Ruben Amorim.",
      "In his first spell, Carrick was seemingly unafraid to make his mark after he reversed Solskjaer's decision to freeze-out defender Phil Jones by bringing the United centre-back back in from the cold.",
      "Jones, who retired in August 2024, had been suffering from an injury during his time under Solskjaer, but had not featured for the club since January 2020. Jones was something of an outcast during the Norwegian's time as boss.",
      "Yet upon Carrick taking temporary charge, he brought Jones with the Red Devils to Spain for the Champions League win over Villarreal.",
      "Jones was ineligible to play for United but was with the team nonetheless as Carrick made a point of reintegrating the former England defender, demonstrating how he isn't afraid to put his own stamp on the team.",
      "The former Blackburn centre-back, who was signed by Sir Alex Ferguson, had been playing with the United Under-23s while working his way back to full fitness. Yet Carrick also included him in his match day squad to take on Chelsea following the Champions League clash in Spain.",
      "Carrick's treatment of Jones suggests that a number of United stars currently on the periphery of the team could see their chances of playing increased should the former Middlesbrough boss take charge and shape the team in his own way.",
      "The likes of midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who has been linked with an exit from United in January, could well see his game time boosted after falling out of favour with ex-boss Amorim. It's also possible that Marcus Rashford, currently on loan at Barcelona, could yet have a future with his parent club under Carrick.",
      "Carrick showed during his previous spell in charge of the club that he isn't afraid to make big decisions. He dropped Bruno Fernandes to the bench for the same Champions League tie he brought Jones along on too, due to the Portugal international not enjoying a good run of form at the time.",
      "Michael Carrick brought Phil Jones (R) back into the fray at United(Image: 2019 Manchester United FC/Getty)",
      "Carrick also handed just one substitute appearance to Juan Mata during his time in charge. This was despite the pair being close friends from their playing days together at United.",
      "An agreement was reached between United and Carrick on Tuesday, with the 44-year-old spotted arriving at the club's Carrington training base ahead of an official announcement. His first match in charge of the club is this Saturday against rivals Manchester City in the Manchester derby in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick will have the task of upping morale at United with the club now only having the Premier League to focus on for the remainder of the season, having been knocked out of both the Carabao Cup and FA Cup this term.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have been linked with both over the last few weeks. Here’s a look at some of the latest reports surrounding potential transfer activity at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United will make funds available for Carrick for the remainder of the January transfer window, with Ruben Neves a target, according to The Guardian. The former Wolves captain is expected to be available for around £20 million.",
      "United are expected to wait until the summer to make moves for midfield targets, including Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton. However, it is said that the club are still willing to give Carrick some funds to strengthen his squad before the end of the window.",
      "It is reported that money will be made available for a potential move for Neves should it become possible to sign him - or for other players on the club’s wishlist.",
      "The stance looks to be a U-turn from the one outlined by Ruben Amorim at the start of the window. \"The transfer window is not going to change,\" he said.",

      "Carrick had been out of work since being sacked by Middlesbrough in June last year. He led Boro to the Championship play-offs in an impressive debut campaign at the Riverside Stadium, but was axed after two underwhelming seasons that saw them finish eighth and 10th respectively.",

      "He has made 23 appearances in all competitions, with his form impressing potential suitors. United are reportedly among those interested in his services, while Italian giants Napoli have also been linked.",
      "Gomes might be left with a decision to make over his future should Wolves drop into the Championship. But it appears that he remains focused on performing for his current side for the time being.",
      "Speaking to Globo Esporte, he said: “We are working very hard every day to get Wolves out of this situation. The season ends in May and there is still a long way to go. We ask the fans to keep believing in us because we are very committed to changing the situation the team is in.”",
      "He added: “I can only thank everyone who has always trusted me and given me the chance to step onto the pitch to represent Wolves. The affection from the fans is incredible, and I really want to give that back. I will give my life on the pitch so the team can finish the season safe from relegation.”",

The 44-year-old was announced as the Red Devils' interim head coach on Tuesday evening - a temporary successor to Ruben Amorim who was sacked earlier this month.",
      "While Carrick will be eager to guide United to the strongest-possible finish in the Premier League as the second-half of the season plays out, the Englishman will also be tasked with forging a relationship with an inherited squad. One player who Carrick would be wise to work matters out with sooner rather than later is undoubtedly Mainoo.",
      "The 20-year-old saw his game time limited under Amorim, making just one start this term under the Portuguese head coach - and that was in the form of an embarrassing Carabao Cup clash with Grimsby Town, in which, United crashed out on penalties.",
      "While Darren Fletcher deployed the youngster during the weekend's FA Cup fixture with Brighton, many fans will be eager to see what Carrick's plans for Mainoo are. As per the Mail, Mainoo's relationship with the United board is \"fragile\" after he failed to see a new contract last year.",
      "The midfielder is also understood to harbour no hopes of hanging around at his current club should his gametime continue to be hampered. It comes as a wealth of clubs have been linked Mainoo as of late, with Napoli thought to be the strongest contenders.",
      "The Serie A club have already demonstrated a keen eye for talent from the Red Devils, with Scott McTominay thriving since making the move to the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium in 2024. The Scottish international was named as the league's MVP in his debut season, where he also helped Napoli clinch the Serie A title.",
      "As a result, Carrick now has until the tail end of the transfer window to work matters out with Mainoo, or risk losing the young talent altogether - whether that be on loan or a permanent move. It comes as Carrick was unveiled as United's new interim head coach on Tuesday evening.",
      "Michael Carrick is the new interim Manchester United head coach(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "In a club statement on Manchester United's official website, the Red Devils wrote: \"Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Michael Carrick as head coach of the men’s first team until the end of the 2025/26 season. Carrick played 464 games for the club, winning five Premier League titles, the FA Cup, two League Cups, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "\"He joined the first-team coaching staff when he retired in 2018 and served under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Following Solskjaer’s departure, Carrick led the club with distinction during his role as caretaker manager.\"",
      "Speaking about the appointment, Carrick explained: \"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour. I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here. There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Jason Wilcox said of the appointment: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United. He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick has beaten Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the interim head coach job at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "11 weeks ago, Michael Carrick thought it had clicked. He sat in the Match of the Day studio, a beaming smile on his face, and talked about the connections that were starting to develop in the Manchester United team. He could see players who were enjoying their football again and a team that had \"a sense of fun\". He was having fun watching them.",
      "Life comes at you fast around these parts. Carrick will swap the casual sweater and the lapel mic for a suit and a tactics board this weekend when he leads United out against Manchester City at Old Trafford. The smiles have long gone and he will encounter frowns and grimaces when he greets the players at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Carrick's effusive assessment of a United performance on Match of the Day came after the 4-2 win against Brighton. It was a third straight win and one of the best Premier League performances under Ruben Amorim. It felt like the Amorim era was finally going somewhere.",
      "As it turned out, it was another dead end. Only three of the next 11 games were won before Amorim pressed for the ejector button in spectacular fashion. Now Carrick has to pick up the pieces in a campaign he thought was well on track not so long ago.",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox have conducted a tour of United's old boys over the past week and have faced criticism for doing so. They have been lambasted for not having a plan after sacking Amorim. However, there is a reason for this, and that is nobody expected Amorim to explode in the manner he did and as quickly as he did.",
      "Tensions came to a head at astonishing speed and within a matter of days the Portuguese went from retaining the support of the United hierarchy to seeing his position become untenable. Even for the soap opera of the modern-day United, it was a whirlwind.",
      "In the circumstances, this is probably as good a move as Berrada and Wilcox could have made. They resisted the temptation to get too sepia with the return of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, instead opting for the sensible route with a coach whose best years are ahead of him.",
      "It's not easy to see where Solskjaer's next job comes from if it wasn't answering a distress call at Old Trafford. For Carrick, 44, there is still the promise of a bright coaching career ahead. If this stint goes well for him, then there is every chance a Premier League job is on offer next season, even if it isn't at Old Trafford.",
      "He also fits more smoothly into a new structure at United. Solskjaer was more of a manager during his three years in charge, while Carrick is more of a coach, although there is a question as to how much this job is actually going to be about coaching. These players will relish returning to a simpler system after 14 months of looking lost under Amorim.",
      "Carrick will opt for a shape they all know and understand, and while he has more time on the training ground than most - too much, probably - it is unlikely he is going to seek to introduce complicated pressing structures or patterns of play to them. Ralf Rangnick tried that, after all.",
      "What is needed is a motivator who can pick the players up after a dismal run of form and a dramatic few weeks that have visibly stripped the group of confidence and belief. Heads have dropped and there aren't enough leaders on the pitch dragging them forward.",
      "Carrick can do that, as can his experienced assistant Steve Holland, who was a driving force behind the throne for England when working with Gareth Southgate. Whether they can deliver Carrick's possession-heavy template in what is left of the season remains to be seen.",
      "He might only have spent 10 days in charge as caretaker in 2021, but he delivered an upturn in results and United players liked the cut of his jib. His training was bright, and he earned credit for the way he stabilised a team that had just conceded four goals to Watford.",
      "Wins against Villarreal and Arsenal were impressive and Carrick's United were good value for a point at Stamford Bridge. It might only be three games, but he has earned a shot at the job ahead of Solskjaer.",
      "He might also be looking forward to an easier assignment or two. His first game in charge was a Champions League tie in Spain and his first four Premier League games will now be against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Arsenal. If he is still unbeaten in two weeks' time, then Berrada and Wilcox will know for sure they have the right man.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo should get more chances at United under a coaching staff aware of his talents(Image: )",
      "Six months ago, Michael Carrick reflected on Kobbie Mainoo's situation at Manchester United and felt that all he was missing was a bit of luck. Show a bit of patience, and that break would arrive.",
      "Now, it has, in the form of Carrick taking over from Ruben Amorim until the end of the season. Mainoo has gone from a coach who had misgivings about him and playing a system that never suited him, to one who's made his thoughts on the midfielder clear and should have a role that is ideal for him.",
      "The next four-and-a-half months are significant for many people at United, from Carrick to the players, and up to Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada. But they are massive for Mainoo.",
      "Had Amorim not pressed the self-destruct button a couple of weeks ago, then the 20-year-old could have ended the month playing for Napoli in Serie A. Instead, he will stay at United, and now it feels like his future is back in his hands.",
      "The sacking of Amorim hasn't entirely wiped the slate clean. Mainoo has just 18 months left on his contract, and talks over an extension have stalled, leaving him as one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, on a deal he signed way back in February 2023.",
      "The chances of landing the kind of contract the academy graduate feels he deserves were slim to non-existent under Amorim, who handed him just 212 minutes of Premier League football this season, with none of them coming from the start. It felt like the clock was ticking towards an inevitable and sad conclusion.",
      "That has all changed in a couple of weeks. Mainoo was lacking rhythm when he started against Brighton in the FA Cup last weekend, but if he gets more chances under Carrick, that will return, and he can prove he is worthy of new terms. Carrick, speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents last July, certainly sounded like a fan of the youngster.",
      "“I’ve seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom to create and take the ball, and I think he’s got a massive future,” Carrick said. “I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience, and that little bit of a break again, which I’m sure he’ll get.\"",
      "Maybe he is the man to offer him a change in fortunes. Amorim always billed Mainoo's fight to get in the side as a battle with Bruno Fernandes, so it will be interesting to see if Carrick sees a midfield where both men can play.",
      "He is likely to set United up in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 shape and there should be room for both. At Middlesbrough, Carrick marked himself out as someone who valued possession and his comments to Ferdinand suggest he sees Mainoo as more of a No. 8, someone who plays around the opposition's penalty area rather than his own.",
      "Mainoo also has an existing relationship with Carrick's assistant Steve Holland. The 55-year-old was Gareth Southgate's No. 2 and played a part in Mainoo's rapid rise to senior England recognition and his excellent form during Euro 2024, which culminated in him starting the final.",
      "That support and those familiar voices should be beneficial for the Stockport-born midfielder as he looks to get his United career back on track. Over the next few months, he has the chance to prove he is currently undervalued at Old Trafford and secure his long-term future at the club.",

      "Darren Fletcher deserves credit for his work at Manchester United last week(Image: )",
      "There was the slightest hint of a crack in Darren Fletcher's voice as he spoke for the final time as Manchester United's caretaker head coach. Although Fletcher had just revealed he had been told to report to Carrington on Monday morning, he would have known his time in the hot seat was up.",
      "You could see how much it had hurt him not to be able to deliver a victory. A Premier League draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat to Brighton was the kind of ending Fletcher didn't deserve, and it pained him to come to terms with that.",
      "\"I've given it my best, and ultimately, I'm disappointed to not be able to win a game or to get a result,\" he said. \"But I feel like there were some good things in there, created a lot of chances, shots, things like that.",
      "\"Ultimately, it wasn't enough. I am more disappointed than anybody really because I care for the club and I want the club to do well.\"",
      "Fletcher was spoken of as a candidate for the job until the end of the season and spoke to chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox at Carrington. However, he always knew this was a two-game deal and that the powerbrokers preferred experience to see them through until the end of the campaign.",
      "When Michael Carrick's appointment was confirmed, Fletcher was offered the chance to stay on the first-team staff but opted for a return to his role as head coach of the Under-18s. He has had a spell as technical director at Old Trafford and been on the coaching staff, but taking charge of the age-group side offers the chance to continue his development as a head coach.",
      "And whatever the results last week, he has shown enough around Carrington and within games to suggest that he has a bright future in that department and that he is someone United should look to nurture over the next few years. United officials were said to be impressed by the way he conducted himself and rate him very highly.",
      "Certainly, the performance against Burnley was encouraging. United had 30 shots and drew a game they should have won handsomely. It was one of the best attacking displays they have produced all season.",
      "Fletcher was disappointed not to get a win during his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "Fletcher certainly spoke like a United boss and he carried himself with class and dignity. He was open and engaging in his press conferences, particularly his first one, when he made all the right noises and said all the right things. That he had switched by Sunday night to delivering a slightly harsher critique of the players and demanding they now step up showed he got the tone right when required.",
      "One particularly memorable moment is the smile he flashed when told of comments he had made as a pundit in 2018, when Jose Mourinho was sacked and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought in as a caretaker. Fletcher has said, \"They're almost writing off this season\". As the quotes were read back to him, he could see what was coming.",
      "“Good research, that! I was young and naive when I said that, wasn’t I?\" he joked.",
      "“That was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in the context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.\"",
      "Fletcher handled a potential grenade with warmth and humour, and it was diffused with relative ease. It was a far cry from the fireworks that often emanated from a Ruben Amorim press conference.",
      "But being sure-footed with the media and sounding like a United manager are irrelevant if you can't deliver. Strip away the results, and Fletcher's two dealings with United players marked out his ability as a man-manager.",
      "First of all, he took Benjamin Sesko aside at Carrington on his first day in the job. He had no prior relationship with the £73million summer signing and wanted to get to know him, but he was aware his confidence needed a lift as well after two goals in 17 games under Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese had been critical of Sesko at times and only days earlier had refuted a suggestion that his teammates needed to be better at finding his runs. Fletcher showed the 22-year-old videos of his movement and assured him the goals would come if that continues. He also contradicted Amorim and told the striker his teammates did have a responsibility to find him.",
      "Fletcher got a tune out of Sesko, who scored three goals in his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "It came together immediately at Turf Moor, when Sesko scored twice and could have had more. He scored again on Sunday and a return of 13 shots in two games showed Fletcher had got him back on track and Carrick will be grateful for that.",
      "Then there is Shea Lacey. Amorim had shown little desire to trust youth at Old Trafford, especially young attacking talents, and Lacey was restricted to six minutes off the bench despite being named as a substitute in eight games. In seven of them, he didn't get on, despite United chasing goals against Everton, West Ham, Wolves and Leeds.",
      "Fletcher used the 18-year-old twice, for six minutes at Turf Moor and then for 27 against Brighton. He showed trust in a player he clearly rates and the instructions he gave him against Burnley resulted in a dazzling cameo in which he was unlucky not to score.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" Fletcher said. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless and he hit the crossbar and he had another shot so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there's a lot of injuries in recent years and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future, I've no doubt it's about that.\"",
      "It was exactly what Lacey needed to hear after being underused by Amorim and the confidence boost did the trick. Those examples show that judging Fletcher just on the results last week doesn't tell us the full story.",

      "A new year but some very famliar faces at Manchester United. 13 days into 2026 and there have already been three different men at the helm of England's biggest club. Michael Carrick is the latest to occupy the Old Trafford hotseat, with former interim boss Darren Fletcher moving back to his role as Under-18 coach.",
      "Including interim bosses, seven different managerial appointments have been made at Old Trafford in little over four years, a list bookended by Carrick. There's every chance an eighth will be added come the summer, but for now it is Carrick who will have the chance to show his credentials.",
      "A manager sacked by Championship side Middlesbrough just seven months ago was always going to jump at the chance to manage United, but the fixture list has thrown up something of a hospital pass for Carrick. A Manchester derby followed by a trip to the league leaders leaves no time for him to settle in. United need a spark and with the halfway point of the Premier League season disappearing in the rear-view mirror they need one fast.",
      "But anyone looking for a crumb of comfort as United look to navigate their way through yet another period of crisis need only look at Carrick's previous spells as a manager.",
      "Solskjaer waved goodbye at Vicarage Road in November 2021, having won just 3 of his previous 11 games, yet Carrick's promotion to interim boss saw an immediate upturn in results with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal sandwiched by a creditable draw away at Chelsea. While it's a small sample size to work with, the way in which United's season unravelled under Ralf Rangnick and the turbulence prior to Carrick's appointment shines a light on the impressive work he did in such a short time.",
      "He enjoyed a similar new-manager bounce during his time at Middlesbrough. Defeat in his opening game was followed by a run of 15 wins from 19 league games, with relegation worries exchanged for promotion hopes in a matter of months.",
      "From a team that looked lost under Chris Wilder, suddenly Boro were on an upward trajectory. The atmosphere at the Riverside was electric and there was a real sense of unity between players and fans, something that had been missing for far too long. Middlesbrough's Chuba Akpom finished as top scorer in the division and was named Championship Player of the Season, with Boro finishing in fourth - not bad for a team embroiled in a relegation battle when Carrick arrived.",
      "Unfortunately for Carrick, he was unable to build on what had been a superb start to life at the Riverside. Defeat in the play-offs in 2022/23 was followed by near misses in the next two seasons, and it was clear the former midfielder had reached the end of the road on Teesside last summer.",
      "Opposition sides became wise to Boro's play, with no real urgency to their attack and a manager who struggled to impact matches with in-game changes.",
      "United fans may shudder reading that, given what went before Carrick, but the impact he made at Boro in such a short space of time cannot be ignored.",
      "If United want a manager who can pick a dressing room up and spark an upturn in results, then they might just have the right man. Should that scenario come to pass, the real question will be what they do in the summer.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "They begin the Michael Carrick era in seventh in the Premier League, but a congested table offers them hope, although it might look a little less packed once the 44-year-old has navigated games against Manchester City and Arsenal over the next couple of weeks.",
      "United are on 32 points after 21 games. Continue on that trajectory and it is clear it won't be enough. There is also a feeling they have just wasted a heaven-sent run of fixtures and that Carrick will now face a more demanding schedule.",
      "There is at least the consolation of fifth place once again being almost certain to secure Champions League football next season. Brentford currently occupy that position, which suggests the race is still wide open. It would be a seismic shock if Keith Andrews' side were still there at the end of May.",
      "A glance through recent history shows what United should be aiming for. The last five Premier League seasons all ended with fifth place, earning between 66 and 69 points. On three occasions, it was 66 points, and that is the route Carrick should be aiming for.",
      "That is because Brentford's current tally of 33 points is below the total of the fifth-place team at this stage of the last five campaigns. They all had between 36 and 40 points. That opens up the possibility of a lower total doing the job this season, but United aren't the only side hoping to finish strongly.",
      "So if 66 points should be the target for fifth, how do United get there? They need 34 points from their final 17 games, which is clearly a challenge. Ten wins and four draws would do it, or 11 wins and a draw.",
      "Given Carrick's tenure starts with games against the top two, it is a challenge. If the games against Manchester City and Arsenal end without victory, it will become 11 wins from 15 games.",
      "United also face games against Newcastle, Aston Villa, Chelsea, and Liverpool during Carrick's time in charge, all of who are likely to be battling them for a top-four or top-five finish.",
      "They will need to rediscover a sense of strength at Old Trafford, having endured a dismal run of home form that could prove costly come the end of the season. If Carrick can land home wins against Fulham, Tottenham, Crystal Palace, Leeds, Brentford and Nottingham Forest, then he is halfway there.",
      "Three wins away from games against West Ham, Everton, Bournemouth, Sunderland and Brighton would be a solid return. That leaves two more to get.",
      "A trip to Newcastle in March looks tricky, as does Stamford Bridge in April. Maybe the best chance of victories are home games against Aston Villa and Liverpool. Two of those four fixtures against Champions League rivals might need to end with three points.",
      "Follow that plan and land 11 wins out of 17 games, and Carrick should have achieved what he has been appointed to do. Reach the Champions League, and who knows what the future holds.",
      "Carrick's 11 wins: Fulham (H), Tottenham (H), West Ham (A), Everton (A), Crystal Palace (H), Aston Villa (H), Leeds (H), Brentford (H), Liverpool (H), Sunderland (A), Nottingham Forest (H)",

      "Michael Carrick is back at Old Trafford.(Image: 2021 Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick cannot win a trophy during his time as Manchester United's interim manager, but there is still plenty to play for in the Premier League. United's target for the season was to secure a return to European football, but Carrick will be aware of the importance of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "United have gone this season without European football. United were sixth when Ruben Amorim left the club and are now seventh, just three points adrift of fourth.",
      "Carrick does not have an easy start, however, as Manchester City will be his first game in charge as interim boss. That fixture will be followed by a trip to the Emirates to face Premier League leaders Arsenal.",
      "So what are Carrick's priorities as he returns to Carrington? We've taken a closer look at what Carrick must do to ensure his interim stint is considered a success by the end of the season.",
      "The defence and mentality",
      "Only three teams outside of the Premier League relegation zone have conceded more goals than United this season. Carrick needs to tighten up the backline as quickly as possible.",
      "Brighton needed just two shots on target to score twice last weekend. United's backline has been relatively inexperienced in recent weeks, with Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven featuring, so it would not be a surprise to see Carrick turn to Harry Maguire in an attempt to concede fewer goals.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt is expected to be close to a return from a back injury. The Dutchman last played against Crystal Palace on November 30, and he was in excellent form before being forced to the sidelines.",
      "United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, and Darren Fletcher admitted the group is \"fragile\" in his last press conference. The players appear to lack belief during matches and lack the ruthlessness to kill a game, something Carrick must address.",
      "The group's mentality must improve.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "Get the players onside",
      "Amorim was popular with the players. When he departed, several members of the dressing room wished him good luck on social media. Amad admitted Amorim's sacking left him \"a bit sad\", while Diogo Dalot said it had been \"really difficult\" at Carrington since the Portuguese had been dismissed.",
      "The 40-year-old will be remembered as one of the worst United managers in history going purely off results, but his man-management skills were a strength, which allowed him to cultivate strong relationships.",
      "It's natural for players to feel disappointed. Carrick must now win them over and forge relationships of his own, which shouldn't be a problem given his brief stint as United caretaker in 2021.",
      "Sources have indicated Carrick had support from the dressing room to take the interim job. He commands respect due to his achievements as a player, he was popular as a coach working under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and players were disappointed to see him walk away after his caretaker spell.",
      "The appointment of Steve Holland to Carrick's backroom staff will help. Holland has bags of experience and already has a relationship with Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Carrick was supported by senior players to take the job.(Image: )",
      "Get Mainoo back to his best",
      "Carrick was interviewed by Rio Ferdinand in September. Ferdinand asked Carrick where Mainoo should play in United's team, and he responded: \"He's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Those comments are interesting given Carrick is expected to play with a 4-2-3-1 formation. Bruno Fernandes will have the advanced role in midfield nailed down, and Carrick's verdict suggests he believes Mainoo is best in that position. Amorim pitted Mainoo against Fernandes, meaning he hardly played.",
      "It would be a surprise if Carrick did not make it work with Mainoo behind Fernandes. The youngster's stock has fallen, but he remains a wonderful talent who can improve United if he returns to his best.",
      "Mainoo made just his second start of the season against Brighton last weekend - and he completed more passes and created more chances than any other player on the pitch.",
      "Mainoo should benefit from working with Carrick.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "Champions League qualification?",
      "United's internal target for the season was to return to European football. Fletcher was the first to break ranks when he spoke after the Brighton defeat, saying that the Champions League specifically must be the target.",
      "\"We're not in a great moment. Let's be honest, out of the cups. But as I said, there's still a Champions League place to fight for, and I still think that can be achieved this season,” he said.",
      "Carrick has nothing to focus on except the Premier League because of the early exits from the cup competitions. Securing Europa League qualification would be viewed as a success internally, but United need to compete in the Champions League for both footballing and commercial reasons.",
      "Carrick will be lauded if he can steer United into the Champions League. United have just wasted a kind run of fixtures, which means the upcoming games will only get tougher.",
      "It doesn't get much trickier than facing Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games in charge.",

The announcement of Carrick taking on the role for the remainder of the season was made on Tuesday following the sacking of Ruben Amorim after only 14 months at the helm.",

      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"He [Carrick] is perfect for what they need right now. Whether it's long-term, I think that remains to be seen. The next four months of the season will tell us all we need to know.",
      "\"But for now, he's just nice and calm. He never gets too excited, never gets too carried away. He's the kind of person where you never really know what he's thinking, because he is so calm and he's always got it under control.",

      "Manchester United's interim head coach Michael Carrick could be set for a surprise reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo worth a potential £10m to the club. The Sun claims the Reds are exploring the possibility of a mid-season friendly in Saudi Arabia to help fill the club's financial blackhole, which would see the two United legends reunited.",
      "The report claims a trip to Saudi Arabia could bank around £10million, with just 17 games left this season following the early exit from the FA Cup. The defeat to Brighton meant it's the earliest United have exited both domestic trophies at the earliest opportunity since 1981-82.",
      "The club are now set to play just 40 games this season after missing out on a place in European football last year, making it the fewest games played in a season for 111 years.",
      "United took home £160.3m in match-day income from 30 games last season, helped by their run to the Europa League Final, albeit where they suffered defeat against Tottenham Hostpur.",
      "Now, under Carrick's leadership, the club will host ten fewer games at Old Trafford this season compared to last, with each game valued at around £5.3m.",
      "Exiting the FA Cup has opened up two gaps in the calendar when the fourth and fifth rounds of the competition are set to take place. It means United have 13 days without a game in February and then another 10-day break in March prior to the international break.",
      "The same media outlet claims United held taks with the chairman of the General Entertainment Authority of Saudi Arabia about visiting the country.",
      "The club may not necessarily end up visiting the Middle East, but if they do, they could take on Ronaldo's Al-Nassr as part of potential plans for The Riyadh Season Cup.",

      "Michael Carrick has been named Manchester United's head coach until the end of the season(Image: )",
      "When Ruben Amorim started to go nuclear at Manchester United, Michael Carrick was watching it unfold from a beach in Barbados with former Old Trafford teammates Jonny Evans and Wayne Rooney. The trio and their families were enjoying some New Year sun in the Caribbean, but for two of them, it is the January cold of Carrington that now awaits. Carrick and Evans surely didn't see this coming even two weeks ago. But then not many people at Old Trafford did.",
      "In fact, maybe it was only Amorim who knew what was about to play out as he detonated his reign as United head coach. Club bosses felt they had little choice but to act and director of football Jason Wilcox led the search for a replacement, with the desire to appoint a steady pair of hands until the end of the season.",
      "Although United were mocked for focusing on three former players who had also all had a stint in charge, in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick, the tactic was a deliberate one. The decision to appoint Ralf Rangnick as interim manager in December 2021 was an example of a short-term appointment going wrong, and Wilcox felt that opting for someone with knowledge and understanding of the club would reduce the risk of a head coach needing time to adapt to the club.",
      "Solskjaer was making his interest in a romantic return to Old Trafford clear within hours of the news that Amorim had been sacked. The 52-year-old has been back in the north west since being sacked by Besiktas in August, and there is a sense of unfinished business for him at United.",
      "His three-year spell in charge defies easy analysis. He delivered Premier League finishes of third and second, albeit in a season behind closed doors, and although the wheels came off at the end, Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Amorim have all struggled since.",
      "But Solskjaer thrust himself forward for this job. He sensed it was his chance to return to a club he loves dearly and to perhaps rehabilitate his own managerial career. He garnered plenty of support from Norway, and half a dozen journalists made the trip to Carrington last Friday for Darren Fletcher's press conference, or to Old Trafford on Sunday for the fixture against Brighton.",
      "Between those dates, Solskjaer met Berrada and Wilcox for face-to-face talks. But by the time the Brighton game kicked off, it was Carrick who had emerged as the chosen candidate. He is eight years Solskjaer's junior and is in the early throes of his career in the dugout. He can be sold as a progressive appointment, while Solskjaer would have always felt a retrograde step.",
      "Carrick met Wilcox and Berrada for the first time last Thursday and made a good impression in the talks. His knowledge of the players was considered a major strength, while his leadership skills and ability to work in the kind of structure now in place at Old Trafford also went down well.",
      "Van Nistelrooy was sounded out as a potential candidate but was discarded by the end of play on Tuesday. Darren Fletcher was informed before his first game as caretaker against Burnley that he would also take the Brighton game, and in every dealing with the media, he was asked what he had been told.",
      "He said the right things, but was never really in contention to stay on beyond the FA Cup tie, whatever the result, although his work last week impressed club officials. There was always a desire to bring in experience, however.",
      "One of the factors against Solskjaer was his previous role at United. He was very much an old-school manager once he landed the job on a permanent basis. He left most of the coaching to his first-team coaches, Kieran McKenna and Carrick.",
      "Although Solskjaer has been more of a tracksuit-wearing boss on the training ground elsewhere, his strengths at United in his first stint were as a motivator and a planner. Now United have a structure that doesn't require many of those skills, and Carrick's stronger pedigree as a coach put him at the head of the queue.",
      "By Sunday night, Carrick had emerged as the unanimous choice amongst the leaders in United's football department, but with Amorim's sacking stripping the coaching staff bare, talk turned to how to build a backroom team.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to build the right profile for his coaching staff. Carrick wanted his former Middlesbrough No.2 Jonathan Woodgate to come with him, while they also approached former England assistant Steve Holland.",
      "Although neither Wilcox nor Carrick had worked with Holland, there was a feeling that his wide-ranging experience and his skill set would be beneficial to the task at hand, with 17 games remaining to rescue the season and secure European qualification.",
      "Interestingly, Carrick's official title is head coach, and not interim head coach. Solskjaer was named caretaker manager in December 2018, and Rangnick was appointed interim manager in November 2021.",
      "Now, United have discarded those temporary titles for Carrick. He only has a contract until the end of the 2025/26 season, but if the next 17 games go well, who knows what comes next? A thorough process to recruit a permanent coach is now underway, and Carrick now has the chance to put himself in the frame.",

      "United kicked off the previous campaign with a lucrative £180million shirt sponsorship deal with American technology firm Snapdragon. Whilst the Qualcomm subsidiary's branding continues to feature prominently, now a secondary \"levelled up\" partnership has left officials red-faced.",
      "In an attempt to promote Microsoft's latest Copilot+PC range, United agreed to display the brand's logo on the reverse of the men's first-team shirts throughout all domestic cup fixtures this season. The arrangement was designed to deliver worldwide visibility across the FA Cup and Carabao Cup competitions.",
      "Qualcomm were delighted with the partnership at the time, with their Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Don McGuire, stating in July: \"What better way to celebrate than once again with Manchester United? And of course, we leveled it up this time. The Copilot+ PC logo will be prominently featured on the back of the men's kit for Snapdragon Cup at Old Trafford on August 9 and all domestic cup matches in the 2025/26 season, as well as all the women's and Academy team matches all season long.\"",
      "Regrettably for the men's first team, these additional cup fixtures totalled merely two matches. United suffered elimination in the opening round of the Carabao Cup following a humiliating loss to Grimsby in August.",
      "Manchester United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town in August(Image: 2025 Getty Images)",
      "United managed a 2-2 draw before succumbing to a tense 12-11 defeat in a penalty shootout. Then, in their first match in the FA Cup, they were knocked out by Brighton and Hove Albion in the third round.",
      "Interim head coach Darren Fletcher witnessed his team suffer a 2-1 home defeat to the Seagulls, with ex-United player Danny Welbeck netting the winning goal. This marks the first occasion since the 1981-82 season that United have lost their opening match in both domestic cups.",
      "As a result, the Copilot+PC logo only made an appearance twice out of a possible 13 times. However, it will be used throughout the season by the women's and academy teams. Snapdragon's sponsorship does not cover the training kit, which is currently without a sponsor, leading to a significant financial loss for United.",
      "However, they are reportedly keen on securing the naming rights for the stadium, potentially resulting in the Theatre of Dreams officially being renamed Old Trafford@Snapdragon.",

      "West Bromwich Albion have named former Manchester United assistant Eric Ramsay as their new head coach. The 34-year-old departs MLS side Minnesota United, where he has spent the last two seasons.",
      "Ramsay was appointed as a player development coach at United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021 before going to work under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag. He has also worked as an assistant coach for Wales and had spells with Swansea, Shrewsbury and Chelsea.",
      "The appointment was confirmed hours after the Baggies beat Swansea in a penalty shoot-out to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup. Ramsay, who has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract, replaces Ryan Mason, who was sacked on Tuesday after a 2-1 defeat at Leicester City.",
      "“Throughout our recruitment process, Eric consistently exhibited the qualities to lead and succeed in the world’s most demanding football environment,” Albion chairman Shilen Patel said.",
      "“In his time as a head coach, his teams have been characterised by intensity, organisation, and adaptability – all critical for the sustained success and growth that we envision in the short and long term.",
      "“Eric impressed us as a person, a coach, and a fit for our squad. I am pleased to welcome him to The Albion as we work with purpose to seize the opportunities and confront the challenges before us.”",
      "While Albion President and sporting director Andrew Nestor said: \"Eric's unique coaching journey has equipped him with significant experience and a deep understanding of English football.",
      "“Eric’s leadership qualities and attention to detail are key traits that stuck out to us, and he has demonstrated an ability to adapt his playing style to get the best from players at his disposal without compromising his football philosophy.",
      "“His recent work as head coach at Minnesota over the past two seasons has reinforced this, having led a squad to perform well beyond expectations against clubs with greater budgets.",
      "\"Along with Eric, we are also pleased to have Dennis join him at The Albion. Dennis is an accomplished coach in British football with experience of the Championship and the football landscape in the Midlands. Together they have formed a strong alliance.\"",

      "Dalot spoke after the loss to Brighton.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has described the situation at the club as \"really difficult\" since Ruben Amorim was sacked. United sacked Amorim amid rising tensions with the board, and Darren Fletcher was promoted from the academy to take interim charge of the team.",
      "Fletcher oversaw his second game in charge against Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, but United suffered a 2-1 defeat to crash out of England's oldest cup competition at the first opportunity. United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup second round by Grimsby Town in August, meaning the defeat to Brighton ensures there will be no silverware won at Old Trafford this term.",
      "The defender was asked what the mood has been like since Amorim was sacked. \"Really difficult,\" he responded. \"It's always a period that you have to find ways to solve problems really quickly. We have to adapt and go again.\"",
      "\"We got back to 2-1 and the energy was up but ultimately we couldn't get over the line. I think you can see the players are fragile. You need to dig deep. The fans weren't happy at the end, they have every right to do that. I'm sure if the players show the right reaction, the fans will get behind them like they always do.\"",
      "United's defeat means they will play just 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years.",

      "Lacey almost scored a winner against Burnley.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"That's why he's number 61,\" shouted a Burnley fan when Shea Lacey came inches away from scoring a matchwinner for Manchester United. Just minutes earlier, Lacey had smacked the crossbar.",
      "Lacey looked like a player worthy of wearing the famous No.7 shirt in the future when he came off the bench at Turf Moor on Wednesday night. The youngster came close to making a fairytale cameo, but that appearance in Lancashire should only be the start of his next chapter.",
      "Darren Fletcher praised Lacey when he spoke to reporters. \"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that. I know he's gonna make an impact,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game. I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "United have exercised patience with Lacey, who has struggled with muscle injuries, and the youngster deserves credit for staying determined to reach the first-team despite his progress having stalled.",
      "Lacey has been forced to watch as academy peers have been given their debuts over the last 18 months. United wrapped him up in cotton wool to protect him, and that foresight should now pay off.",
      "Lacey came close to scoring against Burnley.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "The youngster has carried a huge reputation within youth circles since he was a boy. For some, expectation and pressure are too much, but Lacey got his head down and stuck to his task.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Lacey for his exemplary behaviour, which comes from his strong family grounding in Merseyside. The importance of hard work and staying humble was drilled into him from the start.",
      "At Turf Moor, he acknowledged a fan before getting on the team bus. A few years ago, Lacey went out of his way at Carrington, going back inside the building to gift boots to a fan.",
      "Lacey often took time to take photos with fans at Leigh Sports Village after academy fixtures and signed autographs before leaving the ground. The signature requests might be about to skyrocket this year.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his senior bow against Aston Villa in the Premier League last month, and Tom Heaton gave him words of encouragement as he prepared to come on from the bench.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made a beeline for Lacey when he didn't get a chance to make his debut against Wolves at Molineux. United were leading 4-1, and it felt like the perfect moment for Lacey to come on. However, he had to bide his time and was rewarded at Villa Park just a few weeks later.",
      "Harry Maguire, who is represented by the same agency as Lacey, has also provided the youngster with advice. There is recognition from senior players about his quality and potential.",
      "Fernandes speaks to Lacey at Molineux.(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's rare to find someone who was born in Liverpool who supports United, but the youngest of three brothers, Shea is that anomaly. Lacey once had a season ticket at Anfield, but his middle brother, Luis, would complain that he wasn't interested in watching Liverpool.",
      "\"I can’t go from hating Liverpool in the morning when I’m playing against them, to supporting them,\" Lacey told his family, referencing how it felt to represent United's academy.",
      "Lacey's father is the reason he chose to join United's academy over Liverpool when he was just a boy. Shea's oldest brother, Paddy, came through Liverpool's youth system, despite his father telling him that Manchester was the best place for him to develop due to the better coaching.",
      "Neil Harris, former United academy coach for two decades, now a coach educator, spoke to the MEN this week and reflected: \"Shea was always cheeky, funny, mature when he was a boy, and he could hold his own with his coaches when it came to having fun. He was very mature for his age.",
      "\"As a footballer and a young player, he was exciting, and obviously being left-footed, he was always aesthetically pleasing when you looked at him. He could go past players and loved nutmegging people.",
      "\"The shot he did against Burnley, cutting in from the right, all the wonderful coaches who have worked with him down the years, we've seen that strike from Shea a thousand times.",
      "\"He loves cutting in and curling the shot into the top corner. Stuart Leicester at Ashton on Mersey on a Thursday, he would continually practice that shot with Shea whenever we worked with him.\"",
      "Lacey has spent over 10 years at the academy.(Image: )",
      "Harris continued: \"He always played with no fear. If something didn't come off on the pitch, he would just try it again. There would be no beating himself up, he wouldn't show any frustration, and he would just do it again. He had that arrogance about him - in a hugely positive and elite way.",
      "\"He's an exciting talent, and we're all hoping he kicks on now to the next stage. Hopefully the club give him time, but it would be exciting to see him play at the weekend in the FA Cup. He's a great kid, with a great family behind him, with wonderful brothers and mum and dad. We're dead proud of him.\"",
      "Those who know Lacey best noted he was probably the most frustrated they've seen after the final whistle at Turf Moor. A stunning last-minute winner from an academy graduate in Fletcher's first game as caretaker? Lacey's oldest brother was watching from the away section. It would have been perfect.",
      "Lacey was inches away from a special moment, but that would have spurred him on during sessions at Carrington this week as he trained hard in an attempt to win a place in the starting XI.",
      "The youngster must be under consideration to make his full debut at Old Trafford this weekend. Lacey is the kind of player worth paying an entry fee just to watch in person.",

      "United, under the watch of interim head coach Darren Fletcher, were hit by goals from Brajan Gruda and former United striker Danny Welbeck either side of half-time. Benjamin Sesko bundled the ball over the line in response, but with 85 minutes gone it was always going to be an uphill struggle to find a way back into the tie.",
      "Shea Lacey was then sent off - shown a second yellow for venting his frustrations with referee Simon Hooper's decision regarding a foul - and the afternoon ended in the ultimate misery of elimination from the cup.",
      "It leaves United, who will name a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim after the season's end, out of both domestic cup competitions, with no European football, and only a top-six Premier League finish to play for.",
      "For that sole purpose Fletcher - or whoever is interim manager for the remainder of the campaign - will want a number of absent players and restore the squad to full strength.",
      "United's injury list has actually depleted in recent weeks, leaving just Matthijs de Ligt the only individual sidelined. In his case this has been due to a back problem since November, though the central defender does not yet have a return date outlined.",
      "Meanwhile, Lacey's red card on Sunday means he will have to serve a one-match suspension. The 18-year-old will miss next weekend's Manchester derby at Old Trafford and only becomes available again for the January 25 trip to face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Following on, United have three more absentees who have represented their countries at this year's Africa Cup of Nations since December - Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "The tournament has advanced to the semi-final stages, which are to be played on January 14. Both Amad's Ivory Coast and Mbeumo's Cameroon were eliminated at the quarter-final stage.",
      "It means the two attackers should return and become available for the clash with Manchester City on January 17.",
      "As for Mazraoui, he and AFCON hosts Morocco are part of the last-four and will play Nigeria for a place in the final. Regardless of the outcome, the full-back will only be available for United's meeting with Arsenal on January 25 because the losers of the semi-final will contest a third-place play-off on January 17, with the final scheduled for January 18.",

      "Referee Simon Hooper shows a red card to Shea Lacey in Manchester United's miserable FA Cup exit to Brighton at Old Trafford(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Simon Hooper was correct to send off Shea Lacey for his act of dissent during Manchester United's FA Cup third-round elimination at the hands of Brighton & Hove Albion, says Keith Hackett, the former head of refereeing body PGMOL.",
      "The 18-year-old had been introduced as one of Darren Fletcher's second-half substitutes and rippled the top of Brighton net shortly before Benjamin Sesko's 85th minute goal brought United back into the cup tie at 2-1 behind.",
      "A full fightback was not to be for the home side, who now only have Premier League football to play for the remainder of the season. Heaping more misery on the FA Cup exit was Lacey's sending off.",
      "The forward had been booked by referee Hooper for the first in the 87th minute for bringing down Yasin Ayari. Two minutes later, he did the same to Ferdi Kadioglu.",
      "Although the second foul was not deemed a second bookable offence itself, Lacey reacted by throwing the ball in anger and this was the action that earned his dismissal.",
      "In review, former PGMOL chief Hackett told Football Insider: \"Simon Hooper is correct in cautioning this rather petulant action which, of course, was a clear act of dissent.",
      "\"Hopefully the player will not do it again,\" he added about the United teenager from Liverpool, who was visibly distraught with the sending off in just his third senior appearance for the club.",
      "Lacey protested Hooper's decision before making his way off the field. He pulled his shirt over his face as he approached the Old Trafford tunnel, and television cameras caught the youngster kicking a wall in further frustration over the incident.",
      "After the dust had settled, the United player took to Instagram to post an apology to the club's supporters. He wrote: \"I want to apologise to all of my teammates staff and the fans [sad pensive face emoji]. I let everybody down tonight I shouldn’t let my emotions get the better of me I will do everything I can to make this right [praying emoji].\"",
      "Lacey will now serve a one-game suspension as a result of receiving two yellow cards in one outing. Because these carry across English domestic competitions, it means he is ruled out of next weekend's Premier League Manchester derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on January 17.",
      "The 18-year-old will next be available for selection for United's trip to the Emirates Stadium, where they will play league leaders Arsenal, on January 25.",

      "Darren Fletcher refused to be drawn into whether he is the obvious choice to manage Manchester United on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Fletcher has assumed caretaker duties following Ruben Amorim's sacking and oversaw the Burnley game on Wednesday night.",
      "Fletcher spoke to the media on Friday afternoon ahead of facing Brighton in the FA Cup third round, which could be his final game in charge before an interim appointment is made. United have held discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week over the vacancy. The Norwegian was sacked by Besiktas in August, and Carrick was axed by Middlesbrough in June.",
      "Fletcher was asked whether he was surprised that he wasn't the obvious job to manage for the remainder of the season. \"No, I was surprised I got offered for the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player. I've taken my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now, or a better position now than it would have been five years ago.",
      "\"So I've had five years of learning under good coaches and good people. As I said, I feel like I've developed a rounded approach to the game and football and (am) comfortable in a lot of different situations, academy, technical or obviously coaching and leading.\"",
      "When it was put to Fletcher that he seems like the obvious candidate to lead the team on an interim basis, he responded: \"Maybe, yeah. I appreciate you saying that and but honestly, it's two games. I'm the obvious choice for these two games. Thankfully, an amazing opportunity, but that's all my focus and energy is going on just now anything beyond that is out of my control.\"",
      "Discussing how he has found the experience, he added: \"I've always been quite relaxed about my future. I've enjoyed it. I really have. I've enjoyed the challenge of it and and it's amazing. I've tried to relish it.",
      "\"I've tried to go with my instincts as I said, I think I'm quite well prepared. And. I've always tried to prepare myself to be a manager in the future was something I always thought that I would maybe be quite good at or something that I'd enjoy doing, or enjoy the challenge of.",
      "\"But at the same time, I wanted to be really careful and make sure I was ready for the moment, but it's not something I'm saying I'm desperate to do. I think circumstances in life dictate that, where you're at yourself personally. Health, family, lots of different factors dictate that.",
      "\"And I've got two young boys at the start of their football career. I've got another set of young twin girls which takes up a lot of my time. So those things are on my mind. I've experienced how intense it has been a manager for less than a week.",
      "\"So yeah, there's not much time for much outside the family life and things outside the football. I want to prepare myself to be a manager and that opportunity might come for me one day.",
      "\"I know I'll be ready to do it. But if it doesn't (materialise), I'll be more than comfortable with that, and if it remains staying as the under 18's coach, I'm really happy, I enjoy doing that, and I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United.\"",
      "When Solskjaer was appointed as interim United boss in 2018, Fletcher made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live and said: \"United should never be in this position. They're almost writing the season off.\"",
      "When asked whether his stance had changed, Fletcher smiled and responded: \"Good research, that. I was young and naive when I said that, wasn't I? And no, that was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is it's not my decision, and ultimately, the club need to do what they think's best, the people in the higher up in the roles in the club.",
      "\"They need to do what they think is best. They need to know what their plan is going forward for the success of Manchester United. And I'm sure they'll do that. I think that they'll be strong enough to think to to do.",
      "\"To accept and to deal with that pressure and to make the right decision for what's best for them and for what Manchester United is just now.\"",

      "Fernandes just screamed in frustration as his pass to Sesko failed to be controlled by the centre-forward. There was a little bit too much on it, meaning Sesko had little chance of latching onto the pass.",
      "United’s right side is malfunctioning at the moment. A lot of the play coming over this way, but Dalot been poor and Mount struggling with the width. Kadioglu also really exposing Mount when it comes to running in the other direction. It’s a strength for Brighton at the moment.",
      "United are struggling to build up from the back because Brighton are so well-coached.",
      "Brighton almost played all the way through United from their goalkeeper, but Dorgu recovered to thwart the danger. Dorgu has been in decent form over the last few weeks and has started well again today.",
      "United made a really quick start to the game, creating a handful of chances, but have faded.",
      "That is a disastrous goal to concede for United. The space and overload against Dalot was worked so easily and the marking in the middle was poor as well. They had started so well but that is basic stuff. Lucky not to concede a second with some poor distribution from Lammens. Suddenly rocking here and need to steady the ship. They have to get better defensively.",
      "I'm not sure what was going on down that flank. Brighton were given far too much space and time. Fletcher is watching a replay of the goal alongside Binnion on the bench, trying to work out who was responsible. Mount was pulled out of position and Dalot was left totally exposed.",

No surprise under a head coach like Fletcher, who had the shackles off on Wednesday, but it has immediately got the crowd into it as well.",
      "Fletcher applauds Mainoo for dropping in between the defenders, picking up the ball from Lammens and turning. Mainoo is brilliant at that - he provides the team with an outlet to play from the back.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann is reportedly interested in becoming Manchester United manager after this summer’s World Cup, with the Red Devils planning a permanent appointment following Michael Carrick’s interim spell.",
      "Nagelsmann has experience managing a top European club, having replaced Hansi Flick at Bayern Munich ahead of the 2021/22 campaign.",
      "After winning the Bundesliga in his first season, Nagelsmann was sacked during the 2022/23 campaign and would later succeed Flick again, this time as head coach of the German national team.",
      "The 38-year-old is one of the highest-rated young coaches in Europe and, after a strong start as Germany boss, extended his contract through to the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Last January, Nagelsmann agreed to stay on beyond the World Cup and lead Germany into the next European Championship, but the Manchester United job becoming available could change his plans.",
      "Manchester United are currently assessing their long-term managerial options following the sacking of Ruben Amorim, with several elite European coaches linked with the Old Trafford job in recent weeks.",
      "Nagelsmann is among the managers being considered, with Carrick in place as interim manager until the summer.",
      "According to Football Insider, if Nagelsmann decides to return to club management, he would be ‘interested in taking the job’ at Old Trafford.",
      "Nagelsmann’s current priority is leading Germany at the World Cup, but he reportedly views the United job as ‘an attractive proposition for the future’.",
      "The website reported on Sunday that United director of recruitment Christopher Vivell is ‘pushing’ for the appointment of the German.",
      "Transfer journalist Pete O’Rourke explained: “They don’t want to rush into anything, so the interim manager will allow them time to look at candidates. There are a number of people United are looking at for this job.",
      "“I know Christopher Vivell is a big fan of Julian Nagelsmann as well. He could potentially become available after the World Cup, when he leads Germany over in the United States, and is another name high on their list.",
      "“But for now, they’re going to take their time and try to find the best man to get United back on track, competing for honours and finding consistency.”",
      "It is now claimed that ‘due diligence’ is underway as the United hierarchy assess their long-term options following the appointment of former Red Devils captain Carrick.",
      "There is one ‘issue’ with Nagelsmann, however: his contract as Germany head coach runs for another two-and-a-half years.",
      "As a result, the Premier League giants would be forced to pay a ‘significant amount of compensation’ to appoint him this summer.",
      "Germany’s performance at the World Cup will be crucial. If they underperform, German decision-makers could part ways with Nagelsmann and pursue a different manager ahead of their Euro 2028 qualifying campaign.",
      "United – who sit seventh in the Premier League – either need an elite, proven manager or must follow the Arsenal route and appoint a young coach with elite potential.",
      "A large portion of Arsenal supporters wanted Mikel Arteta sacked for a prolonged period, but he turned things around after being afforded time by the club’s hierarchy.",
      "It is unclear who that figure could be for United. Perhaps it is someone currently working as an assistant under an elite manager, or someone from a similar school of thought to Arteta, such as Cesc Fabregas.",
      "However, after Sir Jim Ratcliffe and company chose Amorim as Erik ten Hag’s successor, it feels more likely that a more experienced manager with Champions League pedigree will be appointed.",
      "That is where Tuchel emerges as an obvious option. The big issue is that Ratcliffe held talks with him before handing Ten Hag a new contract in 2024. Furthermore, Tuchel is in a similar situation to Nagelsmann as he prepares to lead England at the World Cup.",
      "United are expected to finalise their shortlist closer to the end of the season.",
      "READ NEXT: Man Utd XI to be picked by ‘main target’ Enrique could be boosted by two signings worth £165m",

      "Man Utd legend Jaap Stam has outlined what the Red Devils should be looking for in their next permanent manager after sacking Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils ended Amorim’s time at Old Trafford last week after winning just three of his last 11 matches in charge of the club.",
      "Darren Fletcher was put in his place for two games before Michael Carrick was appointed as the Man Utd interim manager until the end of the season.",
      "The Red Devils will then decide on a permanent successor to Amorim in the summer with a number of top managers set to be available at the end of the campaign.",
      "When asked who Man Utd should be looking at as their long-term solution to their managerial woes, speaking on behalf of the Covers.com World Cup betting team, Stam said: “In modern football, tactics are very important. If you look at the Premier League, there are managers up and down the league who are technically strong. Manchester United need someone who has got the knowledge to make the team very difficult for the opposition, technically strong.",
      "“But you also need someone who is a man manager, who can get along with all the players, including the experienced squad members, not just the young ones.",
      "READ: Caretaker Carrick? Fine. But Man Utd must move for Tuchel, Enrique next to avoid Ten Hag repeat…",
      "“A good manager will know how to use the younger players and then also have the ability to talk to experienced players, giving them both the same motivation to work hard for the club and to get everything out of themselves.”",
      "On whether the time was right for Amorim to leave Man Utd, Stam added: “There were discussions about Ruben Amorim’s future and his style of play for a long time, as Manchester United were not consistently getting results. He did better this season, and was getting the team closer to the European positions – he had the opportunity to take United back into the Champions League.",
      "“But how United have been playing in recent weeks is not good enough. The moment comes when the board have to make a decision about the manager, and if the level of performance didn’t change it was inevitable that Amorim would eventually be sacked, and that’s the decision that the board have made.”",
      "Stam also warned new interim boss Carrick that it’s a big step up for the former Middlesbrough manager, he said: “Other than his brief spell as caretaker manager, Michael Carrick hasn’t held such a position at a football club of Manchester United’s size for a long period of time. He’s only had proper experience on a full-time basis at Middlesborough in the Championship, which is completely different to the Premier League.",
      "“Hopefully, Carrick brings a positive impact to the club and guides them through the rest of the season. Finishing in a European place would go a long way given the current situation at Old Trafford, so only time will tell if he proves to be a good choice.",
      "“United need an interim manager who knows the club. Saying that, the club has changed over time; it’s different from when myself, Carrick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played. But you need someone who is familiar with the fans, a good coach and someone who has strong man-management skills.",
      "“For the remainder of the season, I believe the club’s hierarchy will have told Carrick what style of football they want to see, rather than give him free rein on formation and structure.”",
      "READ NEXT: Romano reveals the two managers ‘guaranteed’ a shot at the permanent Man Utd job",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?",
      "Michael Carrick has the platform to finally realise his Newcastle ‘dream’, while his eventual and ultimate replacement at Manchester United is clear.",
      "Manchester United appointing Michael Carrick is making nobody giddy while the VAR call on Tuesday night was a disgrace.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a ‘decision’ on whether to keep Darren Fletcher as part of Michael Carrick’s coaching team.",

He could go anywhere in the world.”",

      "Xabi Alonso has left Real Madrid, because they take the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia very seriously indeed.",
      "Obviously, that wasn’t the only reason he’s gone, even if as a camel back-breaker it does seem a particularly small and twatty straw.",
      "But it instantly catapults him to the top of speculative and concrete managerial wishlists for the great, good and batsh*t of world football. By law, all reports about Alonso must from now until confirmation of his next appointment include the phrase ‘no shortage of suitors’.",
      "But where exactly will he end up? Let us rank the options from hilarious to distinctly possible, based on the early noise being generated about those aforementioned suitors.",
      "",
      "We have very much enjoyed the tone around Manchester United being interested in a man who managed to win the Bundesliga title with a team that is not Bayern Munich. It’s a reminder that for so, so many of us who had our childhoods ruined by Fergie and the lads that Man United remain an outsized deal even in a world that has left them behind.",
      "This is still, somehow, in the eyes of Gen Xers and Millennials, Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And so all the early reports are about how United will graciously deign to consider appointing him, rather than the other way around. It is absolutely unthinkable that Alonso won’t have better offers than a job literally nobody has been able to do for what is now close on 15 years, but it’s all still framed like United are doing him a favour by sparing some of their own bandwidth to consider the idea.",
      "Also it won’t happen because we all know deep in our bones that Man United will not actually be appointing a new manager in the summer. They will give the permanent job to Michael Carrick. But we must all dance the dance until United, yet again, confuse themselves into the shadow realm at the sight of a beloved former player performing competently in an interim capacity.",
      "By the time they realise they’ve made a terrible mistake, someone else will already have snaffled Alonso. And then Jason Wilcox will appoint himself.",
      "",
      "Very much the funniest possibility, as is usually the case wherever Bumblef*ck Hotspur FC are involved. If Spurs end up with Xabi Alonso as their manager, then it will be the most spectacular opportunity yet to deploy the Little Britain ‘I fell’ meme from that time when Andy somehow ends up at the top of a tree.",
      "The genius of both Spurs and Alonso’s situation is that the idea is obviously and objectively laughable, but both their respective situations means you can just about talk yourself into imagining a dimension where it is halfway feasible. And that crumb of feasibility, that tiny minuscule link back to actual reality, is key to what makes it so funny.",
      "We can all enjoy entirely abstract absurdity, but even the tiniest grounding in reality is vital to really great comedy.",
      "And the fact is that a manager who succeeds spectacularly at a club like Bayer Leverkusen but falls on his arse at a club like Real Madrid is precisely the right profile of manager for a club like Spurs. A very big club that, try as it might, will never truly be an elite one.",
      "The Real Madrid mess might just mean Alonso has to take some medicine over his next job. It is not entirely impossible that he might have to do a little bit more overachieving before he can have another crack at regular superclub achieving.",
      "And we will laugh our c*cks clean off if it happens. Which, again, it almost certainly won’t. But almost certainly isn’t certainly.",
      "",
      "Does feel early for Alonso to skive off to international management, but would you entirely rule it out if the World Cup goes either brilliantly or terribly?",
      "Given the first two options we’ve already got past, it certainly won’t be the least appealing potential option out there for a man with 114 caps and World Cup and European winners’ medals with La Roja.",
      "No disputing the fact Spain must be a tremendously fun squad of footballers to manage, one that are matched possibly by only France in avoiding the usual problem of international management for elite club bosses where you suddenly don’t just automatically get world-class players in every position.",
      "One other thing to consider is that this is Spain and, while currently apparently settled and happy, one can never entirely rule out a great big explosive meltdown and managerial banishment just before a major tournament. So it’s not entirely out of the question for this opportunity to come up before the World Cup.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool connections that make the red half of Manchester slightly problematic are less pronounced with City, and if anything it feels more rather than less feasible for this job to be actually available in the summer.",
      "It’s definitely possible that Pep Guardiola decides he’s had quite enough of all this after what now looks like a second consecutive failure to mount a sustained challenge for a title that was for many years his confirmed personal property.",
      "There really isn’t much left for Guardiola to achieve or prove at City if he can’t muster the energy to complete a full rebuild of a new dominant team from the current foothills.",
      "Maybe it is time for someone new to have a go at replicating Guardiola’s success. Make it a proper fresh start.",
      "Having failed at Madrid, taking on the formidable challenge of being Guardiola’s direct replacement at City comes with palpable risk for Alonso’s still currently very much intact reputation, but hard to imagine he wouldn’t be up for that particular challenge/risk.",
      "",
      "Played for them with great distinction, became their scourge as Leverkusen manager, and nobody would be at all surprised to see him rock up in Munich again as manager somewhere along the line.",
      "The only real wrinkle here is that they already have a manager and he’s doing very nicely, thank you. Vincent Kompany as, has was always predicted, trod that familiar path from Burnley to Munich with great aplomb and has Bayern on course for further success in his second season at the club.",
      "But also very much worth considering here that the words ‘second season’ should not be used too airily where Bayern are concerned. Two years is very much at the top end of the shelf life for any Bayern Munich manager.",
      "The last manager to go beyond that was Pep Guardiola, who managed three seasons. His immediate predecessor Jupp Heynckes managed exactly two full seasons. Before that you have to go back to Felix Magath’s two-and-a-half years in charge between July 2004 and January 2007 for the last Bayern manager to beat the two-year mark.",
      "Kompany is already barely a month shy of becoming the longest-serving manager among Bayern’s last seven permanent appointments. So, Alonso to Bayern this year is a lot more possible than might seem at first glance to be the case, is what we’re saying here.",
      "",
      "Obviously. There’s no great trick to putting Alonso’s former clubs right at the top of the list here but sometimes you don’t need to try and be clever. This is a man who has the rare distinction of having played for three legitimate giants in three of European football’s powerhouse countries.",
      "He’s already had a go at managing one of the three and, fair play, it all went to sh*t. But that’s absolutely not going to put off either of the others and probably nor should it.",
      "It feels absolutely certain that Alonso will manage both Bayern and Liverpool at some point down the line.",
      "What’s trickier is how near or far down the line. The Liverpool job is, in theory, as currently unavailable as the Bayern one.",
      "But there have also been plenty of whispers and nudges about the safety and security of Arne Slot’s position even before Alonso became the suddenly available and devilishly handsome elephant in the room.",
      "If Liverpool really do harbour doubts about Slot despite his 24/25 successes, and there are credible reasons this season why they should, then Alonso’s availability becomes another push factor.",
      "Were the manager’s job at Liverpool suddenly to become vacant, it’s easy to see how they and Alonso instantly become each other’s top choices.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left ‘baffled’ at one point in the Manchester United manager race which ‘hands-on’ Michael Carrick won despite a media ‘campaign’.",
      "There is, to nobody’s great surprise, a lot of nonsense about Michael Carrick’s first day in his new job as Manchester United interim manager.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Rio Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils should attempt to sign Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi as Ruben Amorim’s successor.",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?",

      "There is always a very common term for a football player that goes “one season wonder”, and iconic players like Michu, Benni McCarthy & more perfectly fit that category. There is nothing wrong with that, but that’s all they are. It is common knowledge that spending a 100m on a player that has just 1 good season behind him would be a fool’s errand. So why are these one season managers being given some of the world’s top jobs left right and center?",
      "You can take your pick of these one season wonder managers, from Amorim, Ten Hag, Nagelsmann, Alonso and to an extent Slot. Winning a league is a great thing no matter what, but to win it once, and to win it consistently over time, across teams and leagues, is another. and there is a very very wide gap in the talent required to do the former vs the latter.",
      "The above managers have all been found out and been shown that being a consistently top manager is no joke, and a very very hard thing to do. That does not mean that they will not be a top manager in the future, but the fact that blindly backing these managers is not the sensible thing to do for most top clubs.",
      "You are better off finding your own gem in the dirt ala Barce with Pep or Madrid with Zidane or maybe Arsenal with Arteta if he wins the league, or hiring managers who have consistently proven that they are World Class like Ancelotti, Tuchel, Flick, Klopp, Enrique & more who have won titles across years, multiple cups & showcased their ability across a time period to prove it wasn’t a one off event. It’s the same way you’d rather find your own Harry Kane from the academy or go on and buy a Suarez, Lewandowski etc. Players who have shown consistency in their ability to be world class.",

      "As far as United go in terms of meeting the standards of its best years – as well as of a club that spends as much as it does on players – it’s bad. But at the end of the day this ultimately all about 22 players chasing a leather/pig skin/synthetic orb around a field. It should never be at the point of A) fans abusing players/managers/officials and B) an entire industry made up of (often contradictory) articles decrying where everyone is going wrong. In United’s case at least, B) often contains elements of A) (see Nicholson calling everyone at United a “dunderheed”).",

      "Now I grant you, Ratcliffe is probably not best placed to run a sporting club, let alone one the size of United. But are we calling a self made billionaire stupid? There are many things you could say about him fairly in describing his approach to business, politics and humanity, but stupid is not one of them.",
      "And then Berrada has definitely made mistakes – keeping Ten Hag and then pushing for Amorim notably – but he’s had a distinguished career at Barcelona and Manchester City before coming to United.",
      "On the business side United were supposed to be reducing costs to make the club more profitable after years of mismanagement by Ed Woodward. This has been a painful process but wages are down and losses have been reduced dramatically. If you thought United were suddenly going to start making massive profits immediately then you were foolish. The trajectory is a good one though we really need someone to put their hands in their pockets and pay that debt off.",
      "Credit to Ratcliffe where it’s due on that point as he in fact did put £300M of his own money into the club. The person to do so that I can remember (other than the fans who have been rinsed over the years). Lots of negatives too but were they unpopular decisions or were they mistakes? There’s a business case for making staff redundant and raising ticket prices as difficult as those things are to stomach. Should they have focused on staff redundancies whilst sacking managers and spending a fortune on players?",
      "Sacking managers costs money but the cost in and of itself doesn’t affect the profitably of the organisation as much as underlying staff costs. And when the managers have you playing terrible football what does that do for profitability?",
      "The bigger questions are on the football side. What exactly was the deal with the Ashworth pursuit and eventual sacking? I could have told you he wasn’t worth pursuing in the first place but at least United can be said to have failed fast here. I would question why he was replaced by Wilcox and not a world class proven Sporting Director. That said, I’m not sure what Wilcox has done wrong so far – aside from not signing a midfielder in the summer, though United were short of goals and that seems to have been addressed.",
      "I think recruitment has been generally good – younger players (Dorgu, Sesko, Lammens) or those approaching their peak and proven in Our League (Mbeumo, Cunha). Players moved on when they’ve needed to be (no one wants Malacia it seems). Going for Lammens over Martinez was a brave call but a smart one in the long term and with United’s constraints I think. This all seems to be a significant improvement behind the scenes on what came before.",
      "Question marks on some of the haggling over Mbeumo – should we have pivoted to Semenyo? – whether Sesko will come good and why we didn’t sign a midfielder, but no club comes out of a transfer window without question marks (see Liverpool) and a squad as badly constructed as United’s will take years to rebuild.",
      "I think Wilcox has been wrongly blamed for hiring Amorim in the first place and for some reason the Sporting Director can’t suggest changes to the head coach even though literally everyone questioned why Amorim when back to 3 at the back for the Wolves game after beating Newcastle with 4 at the back. But then what do I know? I’ve never been a Sporting Director. And neither has anyone at F365. When Monchi or Begiristain comes out with their own F365 Says pieces about every mistake Wilcox has made I’ll sit up and take notice. Until that point he probably doesn’t deserve to be known as a “dunderheed”.",
      "And on a final point, I’ve been really disappointed that Shea Lacey’s sending off has been used all over the place to somehow encapsulate United’s entire plight. Even Nicholson referenced it, though indirectly. This guy’s is EIGHTEEN. He doesn’t deserve any abuse from anyone for anything that he does on the football pitch. Was he a bit silly? Yes. But do you know what? He bounced a ball into the ground metres from anyone in the 91st minute of an FA Cup tie. This wasn’t a seasoned professional, it was an over exuberant young man who’d spent the last twenty minutes showing his peers exactly how football should be done. Ref could’ve been a bit less exuberant himself.",
      "Maybe we should think about whether it wasn’t Shea Lacey that was a bit silly but the rules themselves or even the game itself. I suggest we all have a think about whether it is in fact us that are all rather silly for putting so much weight on the actions of 22 much younger men chasing a ball around a pitch and those that profit from it.",
      "My point? In a world of Trump, climate catastrophe and pending AI apocalypse, isn’t this all a bit silly? Isn’t our anger best directed somewhere other than at people that kick a ball around or arrange said kickabouts? The problem is not necessarily those running and playing football but us for being so easily distracted – and too eager to be distracted from – the important things.",

Meanwhile we absolutely battered them and looked very good in attack (indeed, we scored the winning goal). Against Brighton, we kept them to 2 shots on target until late game, but unfortunately they scored both, while we had 19 chances and 8 on target but unfortunately two of the best fell to Dalot. Bad result, but we still looked the better team overall, the negative chat mostly comes from frustration.",

      "After spending a week searching for a suitable club legend to replace Ruben Amorim until the summer, INEOS have landed on Michael Carrick over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Carrick is probably the more sensible, albeit boring, option out of the two, with three factors said to be in his favour over the manager he previously assisted at Man Utd.",
      "And now that the Red Devils have a new interim boss until the summer, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his recruitment team cannot afford not to get the permanent appointment right if they want any hope of ‘Mission 21’ coming to fruition.",
      "So, as tempting as it may be to appoint Carrick permanently if he guides Man Utd to Champions League qualification, INEOS must not fall into this trap again after the previous mistakes made with Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Instead, a high-level manager is required to sort out the mess at Old Trafford, and several credible candidates are already in the frame.",
      "READ: Premier League manager rankings: where do Amorim and Maresca land in list of all 28(!) managers?",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner did himself no favours in the FA Cup at the weekend, but this is a rare blot on his résumé, and he had been earmarked as an early frontrunner to be Man Utd’s next permanent boss.",
      "However, the latest reports have indicated that PSG boss Luis Enrique has risen to the top of the list as Man Utd’s ‘main target’ among four options, with Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino also mentioned.",
      "Enrique is one of the very few elite managers currently in football, and it would be wonderful for the Premier League to have him in England, especially with it likely that Pep Guardiola’s time at Manchester City is close to an end.",
      "There have been murmurs about Enrique leaving Champions League holders Paris-Saint Germain in the summer, but this does not necessarily mean he will end up at Man Utd, with Liverpool and Man City far more likely if their managers’ jobs were to become available in the near future.",
      "But if logic was thrown out of the window and Enrique does join Man Utd, how would their team look next season?",
      "Well, it would look very different based on formation alone, as Enrique is renowned for his fluid 4-3-3 formation and this could be used to good effect by Man Utd, provided there are some notable purchases in the summer.",
      "Starting with the goalkeeper, summer signing Senne Lammens picks himself after slotting in seamlessly following his move from Royal Antwerp. This department was a major problem position last season, so it says a lot about how well the 23-year-old has performed that it is now a non-topic.",
      "Man Utd, unlike in midfield and up front, are also pretty strong in defence as they have an array of options, with Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu currently standout candidates to start at right-back and left-back should they revert to a back four.",
      "Dalot looks far more at home at full-back than wing-back as he was one of Man Utd’s most consistent performers before Amorim changed the system, while Dorgu, despite still being quite raw, has shown signs of promise and could be excellent if he can hone his craft under a brilliant coach.",
      "At centre-back, Enrique would likely favour Leny Yoro alongside Matthijs de Ligt as they provide a nice blend of being dependable defenders that can also cope with having the ball at their feet.",
      "The most significant changes would come in midfield, which is inevitable regardless of whether Enrique takes charge or not.",
      "It is being widely reported that the Red Devils will prioritise landing two new midfielders in the summer, with these signings likely to fill the void left by Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro.",
      "Amorim is said to be the reason why Fernandes stuck around in the summer, and without the head coach around, INEOS can take one of their last chances to cash in on their club captain for a sizable fee to raise funds for a rebuild. Casemiro, meanwhile, needs to be eased out of the picture for a long-term replacement, even if he accepts a large pay cut to stick around for another year.",
      "In this case, the dream scenario for Man Utd would be the signings of Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton to replace Fernandes and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba to replace Casemiro.",
      "READ: Caretaker Carrick? Fine. But Man Utd must move for Tuchel, Enrique next to avoid Ten Hag repeat…",
      "Wharton, who could reportedly be bought for a reasonable fee of £65m by a Champions League club in the summer, and Baleba, who is still likely to cost around £100m following United’s failed move last year, could operate alongside Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "England international Mainoo is the big winner of Amorim’s sacking, and this is going to be a big year for the centre-midfielder, with the appointment of Enrique (or an alternative of a similar calibre) enough to help Man Utd with their campaign to land Wharton and Baleba.",
      "In attack, Benjamin Sesko is Man Utd’s current striker project, so he would remain as their No.9 under Enrique and potentially be supported on either flank by Bryan Mbeumo and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Matheus Cunha is an option to cover multiple positions, but Mbeumo and Rashford are more natural fits for the wide roles in Enrique’s formation.",
      "Mbeumo is already a vital player for Man Utd, and while Rashford has proved his worth at Barcelona, their lingering financial problems hinder a deal, and he’ll definitely be more open to a return to Old Trafford without Amorim and with Enrique takes charge.",
      "Man Utd have identified Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique as one of four leading candidates to succeed Ruben Amorim permanently, according to reports.",
      "After Antoine Semenyo, Manchester City’s latest ‘hijack’ on Manchester United leaves INEOS with the lesser of two £100m signings…",
      "According to reports, Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique has emerged as the ‘favourite’ to be Ruben Amorim’s permanent replacement at Manchester United.",
      "Oliver Glasner is the ‘top candidate’ to be Manchester United’s next permanent head coach, with this the XI we think he would select if he’s appointed…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could still offload Manuel Ugarte this month, while they have been ‘set a price’ for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Man Utd could face competition from Liverpool as they look to bring Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to Old Trafford, according to reports."

      "Instead, director of football Jason Wilcox is expected to have the final say on all incoming transfers.",
      "Paqueta was previously linked with a move to Manchester City, but an FA investigation into suspicious betting patterns derailed that transfer and has clearly affected the former Lyon star on a personal level.",
      "A fresh start back home appears to be the perfect solution for Paqueta, rather than stepping into the current chaos at Old Trafford.",

      "With an epic season of Managergeddon in full swing, it feels like as good a time as any to dust off the ol’ Premier League Manager Rankings for a quick redo.",
      "There are a great many more managers to include, for one thing, because the last time we did this it was all the way back in October. If you want to know just how far back in the ancient mists of time October was, Andoni Iraola was top of this list, and Thomas Frank was in the top eight with Scott Parker just behind him as he steered Burnley to a position outside the relegation zone.",
      "An awful lot has changed, basically. And if we wait any longer to do this then we’d have to include at least two more managers; Michael Carrick once his return to Man United is rubberstamped, and whoever replaces whichever one of Thomas Frank or Nuno Espirito Santo fails to survive this weekend’s El Sackico between Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "So crack on we must. October’s rankings are in brackets below, with the full majesty of the many thousand words of wrongness here to be enjoyed in full if that’s your bag.",
      "Mate. Just…mate. Possibly the worst managerial reign in the entire history of the Premier League, and that is some shout. It’s certainly the shortest.",
      "Look, we sort of get it, we do. We get why he took the job. He probably did need to move fast to get back in the Premier League, try and convince someone to take a punt on him while those memories of Europa League glory were fresh enough in everyone’s minds to stop them thinking too long or too hard about the sheer ridiculousness of taking Spurs to 17th in the league. He wasn’t to know then that Thomas Frank was treating 17th as his target this season.",
      "It’s asking a huge amount to say Postecoglou should have turned down a job that got him straight back into the European competition where he’d just had such spectacular success.",
      "But…he should have turned down that job. Obviously he should. It went wrong in all the ways everyone knew it would go wrong, except at about five times the pace. There were, even among those truly cataclysmically awful results, flashes of what makes Angeball so beguiling. There were some lovely moves and stunning goals.",
      "Yet for every one of those there were two or three defensive calamities, and injuries, for a team that just didn’t have those things last season.",
      "It was always just so obviously asking too much of both Postecoglou and Forest’s players to make such a seismic shift in approach work without any kind of pre-season to bring in the right players and get everyone to understand the process.",
      "Postecoglou will walk away with a nice pay-off for barely a month’s work, but with his reputation in tatters. It is only eight months since he did the unthinkable and delivered a major trophy to Tottenham, yet now, two sackings later, his managerial career at this level of club football is surely over.",
      "There must have been better options with just a bit more patience. But still we’re kind of glad he did it, because Nuno to Ange to Dyche in barely five weeks is something the like of which will never be seen again.",
      "",
      "Got absolutely none of the help he needed from the club in the summer, which meant all the talk during the late-season struggles last term about not judging Potter until he had his own players and a full pre-season to instil his methods became instantly moot.",
      "But while Potter was not and is not the primary source of West Ham’s travails, let’s also not pretend he is blameless. West Ham didn’t help him, but he didn’t help himself either, and a once-promising career suffered another huge step back.",
      "We’ll admit we didn’t really know how or where the road to recovery might begin for Potter, but will cheerfully admit we didn’t have ‘Simply be almost immediately named manager of Sweden’ high on our list.",
      "That admittedly incredible run of promotions with Ostersund is still evidently highly regarded in a country that has had an absolute catastrof*ck of a World Cup qualifying campaign but one that still has enormous potential for absurd redemption with their Nations League success meaning they need only find a way past Ukraine then Poland or Albania to bag a place in North America despite finishing literally bottom of their qualifying group without a win to their name.",
      "",
      "Now looks utterly doomed to a two-sacking season which, considering what he got up to last season, is just ridiculous really. He was our manager of the year in 2024!",
      "What there is, still, is mitigation. His greatest achievement at Forest might have been in how long he was actually there before the falling out occurred, and West Ham might just be the most impossible job in all of English football.",
      "But he is also one of about 10 managers on this list for whom the old classic ‘not the problem, but also not the solution’ clearly applies.",
      "We’ve never really been able to get past the way, specifically, he approached the game at home against Liverpool. The Hammers were actually something approaching upwardly mobile at that point, with wins by 3-1 and 3-2 scorelines in their two previous home games and a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth. Liverpool were in that bit where they kept losing by three goals for some reason.",
      "Yet Nuno decided this was the time to go full and absolute Nuno instead of sensing the weakness and opportunity. Gunning for a 0-0 draw, he instead got a routine 2-0 defeat.",
      "It might seem silly to pin so much of a relegation-haunted season on a game against Liverpool and maybe it is, but it really does seem like a point at which, well, dreams faded and died.",
      "They’ve managed just three draws and no wins in eight Premier League games since. They’ve lost relegation six-pointers in their last two league games; Nuno surely cannot survive making that three in a row in El Sackico at Spurs this weekend, a misery spectacle of such epic beleaguerment that it is literally impossible to conceive a situation in which both managers survive.",
      "",
      "To be honest, we had The Fear when Wolves followed up that six-game winning run in March and April with four winless games to round out the season. Knowing Wolves’ fondness for letting the end to one season bleed into the next.",
      "We didn’t think it would look quite like this, though, even after they followed that little end-of-season slump with the classic ‘let’s sell lots of good players and not really bother replacing them’ tactic.",
      "Pereira went from hero to zero alarmingly quickly, and it was clear he had no idea how to pull Wolves out of the tailspin in which they found themselves.",
      "A real pity given how well he had them playing at one point last season, but hindsight has not been kind to that six-game winning run, either.",
      "It was, rather brilliantly, the second-longest winning run any Premier League team managed in 2025 (and it was only recently that Aston Villa – not Liverpool or Arsenal or Man City – bettered it) but it was also against three of the very worst relegated sides we’d ever seen as well as West Ham, Man United and Spurs who were all enduring nightmares of their own from which none has yet truly awoken.",
      "So… yeah. Good fun, sure, but also perhaps the single most misleading six-game run in football history.",
      "",
      "Fell out with everyone, which given who that ‘everyone’ is at Nottingham Forest is kind of understandable. But f*ck, what a waste. Didn’t get the chance to follow through on the brilliant work he did last season and was the first manager out of a job in the Premier League this season.",
      "Despite that, his volatile, anger-filled few weeks at Forest are still probably his best weeks of the season. Because his punishment for the end of his Forest reign has been severe indeed. Surely not even Mr Marinakis would have wished the West Ham job on his new worst enemy.",
      "",
      "It’s all about optics, isn’t it? The photos of Thomas Frank wandering gormlessly around Bournemouth looking gormless with a little Arsenal-branded coffee cup in his hand already have a Steve McClaren wally-with-the-brolly quality to them. When – and it is surely now when not if – the axe finally falls on this doomed experiment, those are the pictures that will accompany this story’s telling.",
      "There is a profound Spurs quality to the absurdity of it all, of course. The series of events that leads to it even being possible just feels like something that only happens and could only happen to them.",
      "But also… consider the reverse. Imagine Mikel Arteta was ‘caught’ supping from a Spurs cup. It would all feel very different, wouldn’t it? The memes would all be about ‘drinking Spurs tears’ and such. Even a few short months ago, this daft little incident happening exactly as it now has would have produced many banters about the impressiveness of finding a cup with Arsenal’s name on it. How we’d have laughed.",
      "Point is, it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s all a projection. But a powerful one nevertheless, one that comes to symbolise everything for a manager who arrived as a details man and now can’t even spot a big ol’ Arsenal badge on a little coffee cup.",
      "What actually does matter, we fear, is that Frank has started talking complete b*llocks. Again, pretty understandable that anyone tasked with managing Spurs eventually finds themselves doing so, but it’s not a sign of anything good.",
      "Consider this astonishing guff.",
      "“In a storm, some are building fences and hiding behind it, others are building windmills and getting stronger and getting more energy and learning from it.”",
      "Now that’s the sort of thing you might normally expect to find written on a toilet wall, but written in sh*t. Or worse, on LinkedIn. Or worse still, on a Jake Humphrey podcast.",
      "But here’s the thing that’s even worse than talking like a Jake Humphrey podcast guest – if you can even imagine such a concept. It doesn’t even actually work on its own batsh*t terms.",
      "First of all, if you’re building anything in a storm then you’ve already f*cked it by failing to adequately prepare yourself. Build the windmill before the storm arrives, if anything.",
      "But also… Frank is no windmill-builder. He has spent recent weeks complaining about the fans, repeatedly pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if that was normal or acceptable rather than the specific thing he has been tasked with changing not aiming to repeat, and noting that January is a very difficult month.",
      "The storm has arrived and he’s been busy building crappy little fences and drinking his crappy little Arsenal coffees.",
      "What felt like inevitable defeat to an Aston Villa side that has streaked past Spurs in recent seasons means that the drudgery of the league campaign is all that’s realistically left for a forlorn club.",
      "Barring, of course, a Champions League knockout run of such vanishing unlikelihood as to make the 2019 effort look prosaic.",
      "Vanishing unlikelihoods discarded, and you’re left with a manager brought in to prove that Spurs could compete on multiple fronts now competing on none, and if the upcoming six-pointers at West Ham and Burnley go awry that will swiftly be literally and not just figuratively true",
      "There is no avoiding the thought that Thomas Frank’s fictitious windmill is about to get all spattered with some more very real sh*t.",
      "",
      "A shiny yet fictional pound on its way to the first reader who can remember the game Wolves’ Under-21 boss was in caretaker charge for. No, you don’t get a pound of any kind for saying it was a defeat.",
      "Chelsea, it was. Lost 3-0. But it did take them until the second half to score, so it was very much not the worst Wolves effort of late 2025.",
      "",
      "Not his fault, of course, but it is just enormously post-2013 Man United that their response to another largely self-inflicted crisis has been to think short and soft before concluding that the answer must again be ‘one of Fergie’s boys’. Except, of course, they’re going one better this time. Now the answer is in fact ‘two of Fergie’s boys’ with Fletcher currently interim for the interim, which at present speed and course appears set to be Michael Carrick rather than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Still time, of course, for them both to get a go as United cheerily write off another season. Even if that season is now sure to be the shortest possible 40-game effort that a Premier League team can ‘enjoy’.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was an astonishing and brilliant one-off. A genuine contender in any conversation around the greatest manager of all time. But he is now an albatross around this club’s neck. They can never hope to replicate even a fraction of his success while they remain in such deferential thrall to his era. Nobody is saying it’s easy to move on from what was two decades of quite ludicrous success. But they really must.",
      "It says much for quite where United now find themselves that Fletcher’s two-game reign, encompassing a league draw against Burnley and FA Cup defeat to Brighton, legitimately contains genuine positives. How far they done fell.",
      "",
      "His greatest achievement at Manchester United will ultimately be the fact he’s found a way to disentangle himself from a cursed club with reputation largely intact.",
      "We’re not even being glib; that’s a stunning achievement that for most of his largely dreadful 14 months in charge seemed entirely impossible.",
      "Yet in the end it was really quite simple and contains a valuable lesson for any other managers who find themselves entirely regretting the life choices they have made that have led them to their current predicament.",
      "Just take on the faceless suits. It really is that easy to get away from any club.",
      "Amorim tried more traditional approaches to getting the tin-tack. Absolute mule-brained stubborn and rigid insistence on his own methods even when they failed again and again. Losing just so very many football matches. Finishing 15th in the Premier League. Losing to Grimsby while p*ssing about with his little magnets. Losing a real-life final to Tottenham, for goodness’ sake.",
      "None of it worked. But mildly suggesting that a random Blackburn winger from the 1990s might not be infallible? Game over.",
      "Amorim’s entire Man United career feels like a modern football parable, and its final act one that should strike a chord with us all. While it may always be the head coach/manager – and Amorim was pretty keen to draw a distinction there as well – who must act as the public face and human shield of any football club it is the silent suits (whether those suits be business or track) who wield the power and yet are nowhere to be seen when trouble is really brewing.",
      "",
      "For very much not the first time, Chelsea have treated an established and improving manager rather shabbily and made a deeply unconvincing subsequent appointment.",
      "This one, of course, comes with the added bonus of multi-club chicanery to make it all feel even more unpleasant. See you this time next year for more such nonsense from the nation’s most beloved football club.",

      "The initial and inevitable improvement from the Postecoglou silliness has now faded rather dramatically. The new-manager bounce has, as new-manager bounces are wont to do, run out of energy.",

      "You’ve got two clear favourites. One is in the middle of relegating a team that has been a Premier League club in all but four of its season, and the other is desperately trying to do the same with an ever-present Premier League club while chatting awful and appalling sh*t about fences and windmills while sipping coffee from a cup featuring the badge of their bitterest and most successful rivals.",
      "Up next is the current manager of the team 19th in the league. And then you’ve got the manager of the team in fourth.",
      "Arne Slot and Liverpool are having a deeply peculiar season. Liverpool aren’t having a particularly good one, but we’d argue Slot personally is having a far worse campaign.",
      "As far as Liverpool as a collective go, our current working theory is that fourth is about right. That they have, over the course of the season, played the fourth-best (or, if one were so inclined, 17th least bad) football of any Premier League club this season.",
      "There are two things to note about that. One, it’s still not really good enough. Not when so much has been spent on theoretically improving a team and squad that last season were very much number one.",
      "And two, that broadly and despite the obvious results-driven narratives with which we all inevitably operate, their level hasn’t really fluctuated that much. They’ve been okay but not great pretty much all season.",
      "It’s just that at the start of the season that okay-but-not-great manifested itself in a string of absurd and unlikely late wins, and then after that for ages and ages a run of equally absurd – and also again often quite late – defeats.",
      "Their results remains absurdly streaky. They won their first five league games, then lost six of the next seven, then won four of the next six and have now drawn three in a row. We really don’t think there’s a particularly convincing case to be made that the actual standard of their play was conspicuously better or worse at any time in that run.",
      "Apart, possibly, from the 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United in which the sheer scale of their headloss and panic was genuinely alarming. That was a game in which they spent the entire second half in 94th-minute goal-chasing mode.",
      "And that’s where Slot comes in. He really hasn’t handled the slings and arrows of Our League’s outrageous fortune particularly well this season. And that’s in marked contrast to the cool, level-headed way in which he spent last season merely polishing some of the rough edges off Jurgen Klopp’s heavy-metalers with such devastingly profound effect.",
      "This season just seems to have rattled him entirely. As ever with any discussion of Liverpool this season, it feels unfair not to at least acknowledge the unique and harrowing circumstances in which they found themselves following the death of Diogo Jota. There is ample mitigation for heads not being right anywhere in the club.",
      "But at some point the manager needs to be in charge. To take charge. It was the most impressive thing about Slot’s first season at Anfield. The seemingly gargantuan, arguably impossible, job of carrying enough authority with what was, famously almost exclusively, Jurgen Klopp’s old squad was handled with such casual aplomb.",
      "Yet now, with a Liverpool squad far more his own, he seems to have less authority and control than ever. This feels like a season that is simply happening to Liverpool, and happening to Slot.",
      "Slot’s failure to treat the twin imposters of triumph and disaster just the same in those early months of the season really do feel more and more like tone-setters for the uncertainty of what was to come.",
      "Let’s be honest, we all got carried away with both the start Liverpool’s reigning champions made and the collapse that followed. But we’re not all Liverpool’s actual manager. He’s not supposed to get as lost in the noise as the rest of us. He’s not supposed to basically accuse Man United of cheating because they deployed the darkest art in the game: squad rotation.",
      "He’s supposed to be above that. And now we must face the baffling but entirely real possibility that he could become the third Big Six manager this season to be outlasted by windmilling Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "Another Big Six manager who paid the price (or got his escape, depending on your perspective) for off-field disagreements rather than on-field performance.",
      "We haven’t ever, in truth, been entirely convinced by Maresca as an elite coach. But he also probably did do just about everything and more that could reasonably be asked of anyone working under the unique weirdness that is BlueCo’s Chelsea, where you are less a football coach and more a layer of middle-management bureaucracy in a vast and inscrutable player-trading empire.",
      "We were even more frustrated this season than we were last with the way he self-fulfillingly talked Chelsea out of the title race, but we also understand what he was driving at. It must be immensely frustrating to try and work as Chelsea’s head coach, a job where the thing that is in many ways the biggest hindrance to performing to the best of your ability is also the very thing that means you won’t get the full credit if and when it does go well.",
      "“Oh, anyone could succeed when they get half-a-billion quid to spend!” is a pretty compelling argument. But only if you as the coach get that half-a-billion quid to spend on the specific talents and player profile you need or want to try and drive on-field success. Not so much when that money is instead being buried on players that a spreadsheet suggests have the greatest potential for future profit.",
      "It’s not even that BlueCo are wrong, in their own grim way. Chelsea’s sales sheet tells you this is a wild and unscrupulous but undeniably feasible way to run a business. It’s just surely not a great way to build a football team.",
      "And we very strongly suspect Maresca’s work in keeping the whole show on the road over the last 18 months is about to look far, far better in hindsight then it ever really did at the time.",
      "",
      "Inherited a shambles, obviously, but the good news with that is the only way is up. Or at least no further down.",
      "The first seven games, which all ended in defeat, did provide some challenge to that notion. But did also offer occasional hints at progress. The 2-1 defeats at both Arsenal and Liverpool were not those of a club with two points from half a season.",
      "And now look at them. Five points from three games and a nice big FA Cup win against lower-league opposition might not seem much, but it is a veritable feast compared to the famine that preceded it.",
      "They probably will still go down, like, but they do now at least appear set to a) beat Derby’s infamous all-time low and b) potentially chuck some spanners in some works for others elsewhere along the way.",
      "It’s not much. It’s a lot more than looked possible a month ago.",
      "",
      "Slightly odd team, are Everton. Often feels like they’re right on the brink of breaking out into being really quite good and really quite fun, but then they… don’t. And, we slightly hate ourselves for this conclusion, but can’t help it: Moyes, that.",
      "He’s not doing a bad job, obviously, because Everton are not in mortal relegation peril and that has been the general pre-Moyes vibe in recent seasons. There is further mitigation in the initial growing pains that come with any move to a new stadium and the loss of familiarity and atmosphere that is all but unavoidable.",
      "Above all else for anyone thinking of aiming any serious criticism Moyes’ way at all is the extreme cautionary tale that West Ham have become since his departure.",
      "We still maintain that Hammers fans’ desire for more than the perfunctory survival football he was offering by the end was perfectly understandable, but bloody hell.",
      "So yes, maybe Everton do for now still have to be careful what they wish for. But at the same time it is now just one win in seven games for the Toffees, including some markedly insipid efforts against Burnley and Brentford and Wolves and a third-round FA Cup exit that confirms the extension of what is now one of the league’s most eye-catching and embarrassing barren runs will continue into a 32nd year.",
      "",
      "It was October 22 when we declared Iraola the best manager of the first two months of the Premier League season. Four days later they eased to victory over Nottingham Forest – their fifth win in eight games after an opening-day defeat at Liverpool – to move second in the table.",
      "Then simply didn’t bother winning any of their next 11 games in the league before a desperately needed visit from Dr Tottenham. Tottenham, for what it’s worth, were just a point below Bournemouth in third at the end of October.",
      "We do hold our hands up when we get things wrong here. Usually because we have no choice and are bang to rights. But this time we don’t think this is an egregious f*ck-up on our part.",
      "Given the players they’d lost in the summer, what Iraola appeared to be doing two months into the season really was extraordinary and we stand by our assessment.",
      "Such was the strife of the summer that even after that 11-game winless run nobody could really say Bournemouth were in a place wildly different to pre-season expectations. Even now he still gets a passing grade for having them just about clear of the stickiest relegation soup.",
      "But for Iraola himself, if he harbours – as we assume he does – loftier ambitions somewhere down the line then he really does need to sort out this idiosyncratic penchant for absurd alternating streaks of brilliant and terrible results.",
      "There are obvious examples within this very league this season of just how much harder it is to conceal those flaws once you’re at one of the clubs where the spotlight is more harsh.",
      "",
      "Look, overall he’s still doing extraordinary things isn’t he? Nobody’s disputing that about a man who delivered Crystal Palace’s first ever silverware and some absurd above-weight-punching all round.",
      "But… coming to an end, isn’t it? Definite ‘far as I can take them’ vibes coming off the place now, and there’s a bit of a funk developing. Let’s not any of us pretend that becoming the first top-flight side to ever lose an FA Cup game to a sixth-tier one was something we expected; but the idea of Palace getting into some kind of strife at Macclesfield on their first return to the competition since lifting the trophy was very easy to picture.",
      "In all, across four competitions, it’s now nine games without a win over the last month or so. They’ve gone out of both domestic cups in that time, and have made hard work of the Conference League where they must now come through a play-off against European heavyweights Sigma Olomouc or Zrinjski Mostar just to reach the last 16.",
      "Most damningly of all, that winless run even includes defeat at the hands of the good doctor after a really quite pitiful non-performance in a 1-0 home defeat to Spurs.",
      "It’s a real shame because it’s been quite a ride, but it just all feels like it’s over. That’s reality for clubs like Palace, who always knew they wouldn’t have Glasner forever. But it still seems to us like it didn’t absolutely have to peter out quite so meekly as this.",
      "",
      "The FA Cup win at Man United feels like a significant one for Hurzeler and co, bringing interest back to a season that had grown in real danger of aimless drift after a run of one win in eight Premier League games dragged them right back to the very middle of the great mid-table morass.",
      "Absolutely nothing wrong with steering Brighton to comfy mid-table, of course, and the sheer size of that mid-table this season has led to Hurzeler having a slight under-the-radar feel. There is not for him the same links to ‘bigger’ jobs that we saw in Roberto De Zerbi’s time or that you get now with your Glasners and your Silvas and the Iraolas of this world.",
      "Which is odd, really, because Brighton do have a pretty eye-catching way of going about their incessant mid-tabling, always seemingly equally happy to be pulling down the pants of the biggest boys – four points this season off Man City, for instance – as they are donating cheap points to helpless lost causes like West Ham or Wolves or Spurs.",
      "",
      "When you’ve set the standards Guardiola has set, it doesn’t take much to look like failure. And two seasons without a meaningful title challenge, which now seems likely after a damaging run of quite silly draws, would constitute that.",
      "The most alarming element of it all is that City have come unstuck at what looked like the precise moment they would in fact strike. They’d reeled Arsenal in, cutting the lead to just two points somehow, and looked poised to make life extremely uncomfortable for a team that had seen it all before.",
      "Instead, they’ve failed to beat Sunderland, Chelsea and Brighton – the latter two setbacks worsened by coming at home in games where they led. Just not very City and not very Guardiola to be letting anyone – either in those matches specifically or their wider league context – off the hook like that.",
      "We keep swinging one way then the other with Guardiola this season. Sometimes we think he’s reinvigorated by the challenge of building a new team and at others we think he won’t last the season without doing a Klopp.",
      "Our internal Guardiola swingometer is once again headed in that direction.",
      "",
      "We really did worry that either he or Fulham were going to do something very silly they would both regret when the ever-tempting sack window of the November international break arrived with Fulham in something approaching doldrum status after a fairly miserable defeat at Silva’s former club Everton.",
      "Happily, six wins and two draws from their subsequent 10 Premier League games have put all that silly talk to bed and lifted Fulham right back to their correct and proper place in the middle of the pack, vying once again with Brighton for the crown of the Premier League’s most mid-table club in what is looking like the Premier League’s most mid-table season.",
      "Obviously the risk now is that he has, if anything, gone too far the other way. He’s almost, for me, Clive, now managing Fulham too well. Because with that comes the danger that he finds himself doing something really stupid like taking the Tottenham job.",
      "Everyone must resist. Fulham and Silva is just one of those rare and precious club-manager combos where no good can come for anyone if it is set asunder.",
      "",
      "A man with a famously excellent record of marching teams into the Premier League in glorious fashion and then meekly steering them immediately back whence they came has, at last, hit upon a formula for bucking that trend.",
      "It’s a fine effort and well worth remembering now just how unlikely it all looked as recently as November. Leeds had lost three in a row and were 2-0 down at Man City at half-time, and it looked like another textbook Farke promotion-and-despair one-two punch.",
      "But while the unlikely second-half fightback in that game cruelly didn’t deliver actual points it did instil belief and confidence.",
      "Leeds have been an entirely different prospect since that day. They’ve beaten Chelsea, drawn twice with Liverpool and hammered Crystal Palace in a seven-game unbeaten run that only ended with an instant classic of a game at Newcastle that could have finished with just about any scoreline but was, unluckily for Farke and Leeds, 4-3 to the home side when the music stopped.",
      "Absolutely no reason that performance should derail what Leeds have going on right now, and they were impressive again in sidestepping a potential FA Cup banana skin at Derby on a weekend when others were far more careless.",
      "",
      "That he and Newcastle now find themselves sixth in the league after what has, for the most part, been a difficult and challenging campaign says perhaps more about this season’s Premier League than it does specifically about Newcastle.",
      "The entire mid-table area, in which nine points separates 12 teams from fourth-placed Liverpool to Bournemouth in 15th, is built to deceive and hoodwink. Find yourself 13th one weekend and it can feel like the sky is falling in.",
      "But win a few games against Burnley, Palace and Leeds and suddenly all is right again. The humdrum reality, of course, is that unless there’s something truly compellingly obvious for good or bad, then caution must be advised about getting over-excited in either direction.",
      "We can all see with our eyes that Brentford are performing wonderfully well, for instance, or that Spurs are f*cking rancid. With Newcastle, though, they weren’t really terrible when they were 14th and they aren’t suddenly great now they’re sixth.",
      "But maybe that’s the point. This is not a season when greatness is a necessity for great things to happen. And for both Howe and Newcastle, for all the difficulties they’ve faced in the transfer market and with injuries and noise, great things remain entirely possible in multiple ways.",
      "They’re back in the Champions League hunt via the league, and they’re going to be in at least the play-offs of this season’s competition, all while remaining active players in both domestic cups.",
      "It’s not been a straightforward season for club or manager, but it absolutely could still be a generational one. Or they might crash out of everything and wind up 11th. That’s part of what makes it all so exciting. There aren’t many others who are crossing the midway point of the season with quite such a wide range of potential outcomes as Howe and his team.",
      "",
      "In the summer, Brentford lost their inspirational manager, the fourth and sixth leading goalscorers in the 24/25 league season (with a mere 39 goals between them), their captain, and their goalkeeper.",
      "They replaced these individuals with their set-piece coach, Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth, some spare parts from here and there, and a Reiss Nelson.",
      "They are fifth in the Premier League. Now even allowing for the congested bunching-up of all the teams who aren’t either challenging for the title or desperately fighting relegation, that’s ridiculous.",
      "We don’t trust Keith Andrews, but we do fear and respect him because we can only conclude some ungodly and dark magic is involved here.",
      "",
      "Sunderland are actually now without a Premier League win in five games. Nobody has noticed this because a) they’re still doing tremendously well, obviously, and more importantly b) they still drew four of them.",
      "The amusing reality is that during this sticky spell since the derby-day win over Newcastle they have still extended their lead over each and every member of the current bottom four.",
      "In summary, then: even when things have been as bad as they been all season for Sunderland, when they have been shorn of their AFCON stars and bedevilled by injuries, Regis Le Bris and the gang are still comfortably exceeding, even in that specific run, any and all pre-season expectations.",
      "If you find yourselves, as a promoted club, in a situation where you can have a bad run and slip all the way down to 10th in the table, then things really are going tremendously well.",
      "",
      "The starkest of all reminders that October was f*cking ages ago. Back then, Emery and Villa were still making their first tentative steps in turning round a miserable start to the season, one that felt full of hangovers and regrets and disappointment at the way 2024/25 had finished on the final day at Old Trafford.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League by cruel and fine margins had felt like a significant sliding doors moment for Emery and Villa, and a difficult summer and even worse start to the new campaign left the unmistakable sense of something wonderful coming to its end without ever really hitting the heights it might have done.",
      "Then Villa – and we really don’t understand why more managers and teams don’t adopt such a policy – simply set about winning all of the football matches.",
      "After no wins and just a single goal in their first five league matches of the season, Villa won 12 of the next 13. Even after a recent ‘slump’ that comprises a defeat at champions-elect Arsenal and goalless draw at Crystal Palace, they remain level on points with City and miles clear of any undignified squabbly scramble for a Champions League finish.",
      "Add in routine FA Cup progress at Spurs, who they have for now overtaken entirely, and serene progress through the very winnable Europa League and this now longer feels anything like something coming to a premature end.",
      "It really might only just be getting started.",
      "",
      "Still as odd as socks, but he has built a champion Arsenal team that, for the first time since The Invincibles, combines both the talent to win the league with the minerals.",
      "There was a good deal of guff after the defeat at Villa, with a large amount read into the body language of the players after conceding the late winner.",
      "Now a lot of that is because it is always and undeniably funny to watch grown adult men have full limb-thrashing toddler tantrums more akin to a three-year-old denied sweets in Tesco. But a lot of it was along more faux-concerned ‘hope not, hope not’ lines about what it indicated about their mental state and preparedness for the battle ahead.",
      "Now it’s true that Arsenal weren’t good in their next match either, and were pretty lucky it was against Wolves. But they did still manage to win it. And then the next four after that. And then draw with Liverpool to preserve what had by then grown into a six-point lead at the top of the table.",
      "We’re not saying Arteta suddenly has a gang of mentality monsters on his hands. But they’re not about to do anything that even the internet can dress up as a bottling, and just as importantly nobody now looks remotely equipped to place them under the kind of pressure that might test that new-found steel in any meaningful way.",
      "They will win the league, they will thoroughly deserve to win the league, and the fact they’ll have done it after signing a ‘missing piece of the puzzle’ striker who is absolutely sh*tbone awful is only more impressive, in a way.",
      "Whether it’s vindication for absolutely all of Arteta’s various eccentricities we’re not so sure. But it will absolutely prove what has been obvious for some time now behind all the banters and whimsy. He is very, very good at this job.",

      "When a half-season hit of ‘DNA’ or a heady dose of nostalgia fails to arouse Manchester United fans, that’s when you know you’ve really f***ed up.",
      "The appointment of Michael Carrick as interim manager at Old Trafford has been greeted with the same indifference that provided the backdrop to the week-long race to the hot seat. Carrick emerged the winner, beating Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in what was largely a toss-up with a double-sided coin.",
      "However United came to the decision, it is perhaps the best of the two outcomes. It could be viewed as a triumph for tactics over vibes. Which might be a step forward; it really is hard to tell at Manchester United.",
      "And that wait in itself could become a problem for Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and whoever else calls the shots at Old Trafford these days. While they are doubtless backslapping each other right now – well done, boys, good process – the fear lingers that the board have set themselves up for another fall.",
      "Because there is a chance that Carrick succeeds. What then?",
      "United’s stated aim at the start of this season was a return to the Champions League and, perhaps more because of the ineptitude of others than anything they themselves are doing right, that remains a realistic goal.",
      "It is likely England will have five teams in the Champions League next season. Carrick and his coaching staff walked into Carrington to take over a side one point off fifth in the Premier League with – woefully, but handily – absolutely no distractions whatsoever.",
      "If Carrick drags United back to the top table of European football for 2026/27 while stirring Stretford End sentiment, it would not be an unreasonable expectation of the interim boss to have his title changed to something a little more permanent.",

      "MORE Who will be Manchester United manager next season? Xabi enters the building…",

      "It is damning that restrained ambition may be seen by United as a positive trait, but also understandable. Because INEOS have been here before.",
      "In 2024, it seems they were set on replacing Erik ten Hag, which was the right call. Then, inconveniently, he went and bloody won the FA Cup. New contracts all round.",
      "That, to the surprise of almost no one, proved to be the wrong call, though it is was certainly the easiest at the time even in the absence of clamour from fans. Have United learned their lesson?",
      "We could find out in May. The fear must be that this United board will simply kick the can down Sir Matt Busby Way before gathering the day after the end of the season to thrash out the way forward. Europe beckons? Carry on, Carrick.",
      "But if United want to be taken seriously again, then Ratcliffe, Wilcox and Berrada have to get serious themselves – and decisive. Carrick may fulfil his brief but the board must still use the time bought by his interim appointment to identify a coach with serious credentials, then lure them to Old Trafford and do whatever preparation necessary for the next manager to hit the ground running.",

      "“You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes and, as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final.",
      "“No-one comes as close to fulfilling everything laid out above than he does. Ironically, the club met with Carlo shortly before his [Sir Alex Ferguson’s] retirement in 2013 and we could have short-circuited this entire process, starting with him at the beginning of the cycle.",

      "“If not, Thomas Tuchel is the outstanding candidate.”",
      "Outlining the four key criteria for any new Man Utd manager, Neville added: “You have to be able to handle the media and the noise which comes with this club. It is what it is so get over it and deal with it. It’s why you’re getting paid the big bucks.",
      "“You have to show that you can have success getting into the top four, that you can cope with Champions League football and that you can get the best out of a group of players that will include egos and superstars.",
      "“You must understand the Premier League and English football culture because it’s different to competing in many of the European leagues.",
      "“You also have to understand the Manchester United way, which means you have to be a glass-half-full kind of manager. Be positive and prepared to take risks and play with pace and excitement. In all likelihood that is going to a variation of 4-4-1-1 / 4-2-3-1.”",

      "Carrick will no doubt be relishing a return to Man Utd, but former defender Paul Parker has warned him that he could be ‘ridiculed for life’.",
      "Parker said: “From now and until the end of the season will be a nightmare. It is a big worry that the caretaker will have to be there for almost half a season.",
      "“But on the other hand, who wants the job right now at Man United? Almost no one. It is very interesting, because in the ideal world the next manager should be thinking about what he could become. He can become the next Sir Alex Ferguson.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly keen on signing former Wolves captain Ruben Neves, who is available for £20million in a transfer that has the potential to be the signing of the year.",
      "Neves is available this month for a bargain fee with his Al Hilal contract set to expire in June.",
      "United are interested in adding the Portuguese midfielder during the January transfer window and there appears to be little competition for his signature. Quite simply, they cannot mess this up.",
      "According to The Guardian, the Red Devils are targeting a new midfielder this month, with Neves firmly on their radar.",
      "United are expected to be active in the transfer market despite not having a permanent manager in place, with the report stating that Michael Carrick is set to be appointed interim boss this week.",
      "The club’s hierarchy are assessing whether a move for Neves is ‘viable’ and, if so, funds are available to complete the deal.",
      "The report states:",
      "With midfield one of the positions United want to strengthen, Al- Hilal’s Rúben Neves is a target. The Portuguese would cost about £20m and should his acquisition become viable there are funds available for his purchase or for any other player on the club’s transfer wishlist.",
      "Neves is exactly what United need. In fact, he’s exactly what many elite teams need. He remains a top-level midfielder and has not declined since moving to Saudi Arabia from Wolves in the summer of 2023.",
      "The 28-year-old was never reliant on pace, and he certainly hasn’t stopped moving in the Middle East.",
      "He still starts regularly for Portugal in a midfield that includes Vitinha, Joao Neves, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva and Joao Palhinha.",
      "Neves is a player Europe’s elite cannot ignore, and at £20m, he is a no-brainer for almost every top club. Which begs the question: why aren’t more teams in for him?",
      "United should act decisively before more come to the party. Central midfield has been a problem position for years.",
      "Ball-dominant teams often need a ball-playing defensive midfielder, not pure destroyers like Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Arsenal have Martin Zubimendi. Liverpool have Ryan Gravenberch. Manchester City have Rodri. Newcastle have Sandro Tonali. All four are superb on the ball and possess the defensive intelligence required to anchor midfield for elite sides.",
      "Casemiro has improved recently, but he is no longer the defensive force he once was, and he is certainly not someone who dictates tempo or consistently plays line-breaking passes.",
      "Neves would bring control, experience and genuine quality to United’s midfield. At £20m, he is a bloody steal, and could be the bargain of the year if the Red Devils do what they so often fail to do: the right thing.",

      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "By Rob Dorsett & Danyal Khan",
      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:27, UK",
      "Manchester United have gone with Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season, as Rob Dorsett and Danyal Khan break down why the club's hierarchy and Jason Wilcox landed on the appointment...",
      "When Ruben Amorim was sacked last week, people close to him told us the Portuguese coach had been surprised - and struggled - with the sheer volume of noise in and around Old Trafford. Amorim confided in his friends to say how impossible it was to fully prepare or predict what the unique challenges were of being the main man at Manchester United.",
      "United's bosses weren't about to make the same mistake twice.",
      "That is why United's shortlist of candidates for the interim head coach position was made up entirely of United old-boys. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick were to the fore.",
      "The club hierarchy, led by director of football Jason Wilcox, wanted someone who knows the club, who has experienced the pressure and the expectation, who would feel comfortable in a difficult environment where the spotlight is blinding, and where the mood among the fanbase is still filled with frustration, remembering glories past.",
      "Michael Carrick was up front and central in that glorious past. As a player under Sir Alex Ferguson, he won five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one Europa League, one FA Cup, two League Cups and one Club World Cup. His first taste of coaching was at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho, and he had short stints as caretaker boss, either side of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell in charge. United's bosses are as confident as they can be, that he will not be fazed by the environment he is stepping back into.",
      "It is clear the club's hierarchy didn't want to change head coach mid-season, but with poor results and a total breakdown in the relationship with Amorim, the club was forced to act. Many fans and commentators will ask why United couldn't appoint a new, high-profile manager straight away. But the reality is that Manchester United doesn't have the same pull for the world's elite coaches that it did a decade ago. There is no European football. Budgets are tight. There is still a major restructuring of the entire club taking place.",
      "And so it was sensible for the club to take a pragmatic approach, and save the big decision about the next big boss until the summer, when more big names will be available. Once that decision was made, it was a question of who would be best to run things for the remainder of the season, and give the team maximum chance to achieve European football for 2026/27.",
      "That man, it was decided, was Carrick. And even though he and no one else on the coaching staff has ever worked with Steve Holland before, there was a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable. Importantly, he was also available to start immediately, without the need to pay compensation.",
      "Other key factors in Carrick's appointment were his familiarity with the structure of power at United. Wilcox works closely with the head coach over strategy, philosophy and team selection. Ultimately, it was the significant differences of opinion and Amorim's reluctance to align tactically with Wilcox that saw him get the boot.",
      "Carrick has made it clear he is happy to work within United's existing systems, pointing out that he did so effectively at Middlesbrough, where he worked closely with head of football Kieran Scott. He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.",
      "Sometimes criticised for a lack of adaptability at the Riverside Stadium, Carrick stuck true to his footballing philosophy - one where dominating the football, and opposition, was the primary game plan. That idea, too, aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play.",
      "But what about the other main candidate, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?",
      "The noise from Solskjaer's camp early on was that he was not just interested in the role, he was the favourite. That was noticed inside Carrington with bemusement considering they were clear that no decision would be made until they sat down with the two candidates.",
      "Multiple sources have told us after meeting Carrick face-to-face last Thursday, United's leadership were left impressed. More so than for Solskjaer.",
      "As mentioned, his philosophy and tactical approach undoubtedly made an impact on the likes of Wilcox and Berrada but his willingness to take on the role with no guarantee of a permanent role at the end of the season was also to his advantage during the process.",
      "Solskjaer, it is understood, wanted a permanent option if he performed well in the role - a desire which the United hierarchy were not willing to entertain - clear that role was until the end of the season.",
      "It also has to be considered that a potential return for Solskjaer, who was manager under the previous regime, could be interpreted as a backward step. After consistent messaging around INEOS being forward-thinking, questions would have been asked about returning to a previous manager who did not necessarily succeed during his first spell at the club. Popular with the fan base, yes, but it was a difficult sell and not a good look.",
      "And so Carrick begins his limited reign as United's main man. As things stand, it is unlikely he will be considered for the longer-term role in the summer, alongside the likes of Thomas Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Marco Silva et al. But the hope is that his appointment will prove to be a positive one for both the coach, and the club which he now heads.",
      "He needs to hit the ground running, but he will be given a little leeway early on - Manchester City at home and Arsenal away - will prove a baptism of fire.",

      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first ever defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or fewer in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored an FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many.",
      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

The loss means United will play just 40 games this season - their lowest since the 2014/15 campaign when they played 44 games, and Fletcher said that the fans had every right to show their displeasure.",
      "Whoever takes over will have to deal with mounting problems at Old Trafford, where there was a banner criticising the running of the club by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. There were also chants United fans are also chanting: 'We Want the Glazers Out.'",
      "United, who sacked Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge last Monday, are now without a win in four matches in all competitions and with games to come against Man City at the weekend and a trip to Arsenal, things don't get any easier.",
      "Meanwhile, Brighton's fantastic recent record continues against United. Fabian Hurzeler's side beat United for the first time in the FA Cup. They now have seven wins in nine games against United and four victories in five visits to Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher was given a warm welcome by Old Trafford as he emerged from the tunnel and his side started well, with a pair of early Jason Steele saves to deny Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes keeping Brighton in the contest.",
      "Brighton had been eliminated by United in the six previous FA Cup ties between them, but they were sent on their way to ending that hoodoo when Gruda reacted quickest to lash home the rebound after Georginio Rutter's header was cleared off the line.",
      "Fletcher attempted to gee up the crowd when he returned, but there was little to cheer during a disappointingly slow start to the second period. Lacey and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced in a bid to change the dynamics, but just moments later Brighton extended their lead.",
      "Welbeck received a pass from Gruda and was all too easily able to take a touch and slam a 65th-minute shot into the top left-hand corner.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the message from the United fans as they urged their side to get back into the game. Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",
      "\"You can see that the players are fragile and they need to build themselves up. It's up to them now, they've got to respond.",
      "\"Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football and when you don't have it, you have to dig deep, you have to win, battle, fight, grind, work, win games and then the confidence comes back.",
      "\"They're experiened players, they're talented players and I challenge them to regroup. Someone is going to come in and lead them and they need to make sure they've got a lot to play for this season.",
      "\"This team is still good enough to have success this season, but they've got to dig deep and find a way within themselves.\"",
      "Last game? \"This is what I've been asked to do so I've not had any discussions beyond that. I did the job this week and we have to concentrate on the game. All the discussions around that will unfold in the next couple of days.\"",
      "\"We created enough to win the game to be honest.",
      "\"Then the red card gave us a disadvantage because we were on top of Brighton in the last moments.",
      "\"Overall, very disappointed because we wanted to go through. All the lads kept trying to find spaces, like I said really disappointed because I think we deserved to win.",
      "On how it has been since the managerial change, he added: \"Really difficult. It's always a period that you have to find ways to solve problems really quickly.",
      "\"We have to adapt and go again.\"",
      "Brighton will now have all eyes on the FA Cup fourth-round draw when it takes place on Monday.",
      "The draw will be made at Anfield ahead of the last match in the third round between Liverpool and Barnsley.",

      "The exit of Amorim, 14 months after he arrived at the club, marked the sixth manager to be dismissed at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, with Neville now calling for the hierarchy to remove any form of risk when they make the final decision on his successor.",

      "Monday 12 January 2026 08:53, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "It creates a narrative that this is the kind of football Frank plays. And that is one he can barely argue, because it is what Spurs fans have been forced to endure week after week this season. But it was not always like this.",
      "\"What he has to show and tell everybody now is that he's not just a set-piece coach. Because that's what he looks like right now.\"",
      "Those nights at the Gtech playing through the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City and putting four past Manchester United feel a world away.",
      "Brentford scored more goals in open play than Chelsea last season. They were the fifth-highest scorers overall and produced 1.5xG fewer than Arsenal across the course of the campaign.",
      "But at a side with resources he could have only dreamt of 12 months ago, he has overseen relative drops in every single attacking metric.",
      "His old Brentford side was crafted with Matthew Benham's superbly honed data-driven system with a hit rate for finding hidden gems to rival any Premier League scouting department.",
      "He does not have that tailor-made side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but that does not mount anything like a sufficient excuse for the insipid football he has served up in his first six months.",
      "With results and style so poor, it's inevitable the pressure is ramping up around Frank. He must find a way to change things and fast before it is taken out of his hands.Ron Walker",
      "It's been a tough start to 2026 for Man City.",
      "They are without a win so far this year and they've been hit with injuries to key players. Central defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias and winger Savinho have sufferred significant injuries. John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",
      "And while Brighton did spurn some really good early chances, it wasn't City's makeshift defence that cost them victory at the Etihad.",
      "Pep Guardiola bemoaned the chances his side wasted, not only against Brighton, but also in the draws against Sunderland and Chelsea.",
      "Guardiola said: \"The result is the result. I'm not a person who believes what we have done isn't fair. One point for them, one point for us. That is what it is. I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",
      "It was a heart-breaking outcome for Leeds, who took a deserved lead through Brenden Aaronson's superb first-half strike and kept putting their noses back in front. Their brave performance, at a ground were so many teams struggle, deserves acclaim.",
      "For the neutral, the end-to-end action of the game was a tonic to some of the stop-start, set-piece-heavy offerings served up in the Premier League this season.",
      "The number of goals could easily have been higher. The woodwork was struck three times. There were goalmouth scrambles, goalkeeper saves, last-ditch defensive interventions galore. It was an occasion to savour, albeit not for Leeds fans.Nick Wright",
      "Liam Rosenior will have seen first-hand a major issue for this Chelsea team: a lack of discipline.",
      "Marc Cucurella's red card was as blatant as they come (whether the foul continued into the penalty area and should have been a spot-kick is another debate).",
      "It was Chelsea's seventh red card across all competitions - that's four more than any other Premier League team. They're just one off their Premier League record of six with almost half a season to go.",
      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",
      "It's Harry Wilson's world and we're just living in it. \"Right now everything that he touches becomes something magic,\" said his boss Marco Silva, after the Welshman hit Fulham's winner against 10-man Chelsea.",
      "That's nine goal involvements in his past 10 games for Wilson. \"The numbers are top, incredible,\" added the Fulham head coach.",
      "Silva reckons this is Wilson's \"best moment\" of his career and it's hard to argue. Of course there have been other standout moments for him in a Fulham shirt but Silva noted how the pair had a conversation last season to help try to draw out these kind of consistently impactful performances.",
      "\"In terms of maturity, decision-making, more calm in some moments - you don't need 100 per cent speed in everything,\" Silva explained.",
      "Wilson, Silva and Fulham are reaping the rewards now.Peter Smith",
      "\"Because of my career and the teams I've managed, I've been through a lot of these awkward games.\" And Sean Dyche tends to succeed in most of them.",
      "Four consecutive defeats in a row set Nottingham Forest up to be dragged further into the relegation scrap by West Ham. After just 13 minutes, that was their reality.",
      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",
      "Forest had more xG, more shots on target, more touches in the opposition box and more possession. And with Dyche they had more experience in how to grind out a crucial victory in a relegation six-pointer.",
      "\"It's not easy on anybody,\" he concluded. \"The players, overall, have just about deserved it.\"David Richardson",
      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."
