      "Wayne Rooney made his debut as a Match of the Day regular over the weekend - and fans were left divided by the Manchester United legend. The former England man has made the move into punditry as part of the BBC’s new-look programme for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Rooney was reportedly offered an £800,000 contract by the BBC for his new role. And his first opportunity to impress came on Saturday as the new season returned.",
      "Rooney was alongside fellow pundit Alan Shearer, while Mark Chapman hosted the programme for the first time since his appointment as the permanent lead. Not every viewer was a big fan of Rooney’s debut though.",
      "Taking to Twitter, one football fan said: “I’m going to say this now as it will be said all season; I mean no offence to him personally, but having Wayne Rooney on match of the day is a big mistake.”",
      "One fan replied: “Why???? He's an ex player who's won the tot at the top level why not have in on instead of people who know nothing about football???, “while another hit back: “He's no worse than 90% of footballer pundits. At least he's done it at the top level.”",
      "A further viewer then said: “He was an amazing footballer that has played and won at the top. But just because you have done something, does not automatically make you good to talk/explain and teach others well.”",
      "And while response to Rooney’s debut was mixed, one fan had a particularly amusing reaction to the broadcast, brutally echoing Tom Brady’s criticism of the legendary striker during his time with Birmingham City. They wrote: “I’m a little concerned about our new @BBCMOTD pundit’s work ethic…\"",
      "Rooney has been out of work since a number of difficult years as a manager. He was sacked by Birmingham after just 15 games in charge, with the Blues then falling into League One shortly after.",
      "Rooney was then appointed as boss of Plymouth Argyle ahead of the 2024/25 campaign but he took charge of just 25 games before being sacked. And he has since hinted that he has no immediate ambitions of returning to the dugout.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT earlier this month, the former striker said: “Obviously just doing some TV work at the minute, so that’s what I’m doing. I’m enjoying it. So, that’s where I’ll be.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly weighing up a shock move for former goalkeeper David de Gea. The Spaniard spent 12 years at Old Trafford and made a total of 545 appearances across all competitions, helping them win the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and two League Cups.",
      "De Gea left United in 2023 after his contract expired, with Erik ten Hag deciding to replace him with Andre Onana. After spending a season as a free agent, De Gea joined Fiorentina in 2024 and the 34-year-old has impressed in Italy.",
      "After helping Fiorentina finish sixth last season and qualify for the Conference League, De Gea signed a new contract that runs until 2028. However, the Sun are reporting that his new deal includes a release clause that will let him leave for a 'relatively small sum'.",
      "The report states that United are considering a potential return for De Gea after being 'tipped off' about the clause. De Gea recently returned to Old Trafford with Fiorentina for a pre-season friendly and teased that their \"paths may cross again\".",
      "After being presented with a framed picture by United captain Bruno Fernandes, De Gea wrote on social media: \"A magical moment for me and my family to come back to Old Trafford — my home.",
      "\"From the bottom of my heart — I want to say thank you for the reception — for all the love you showed me. To the supporters that never stopped being with me throughout my time at this club. Our paths may cross again.\"",
      "Onana has failed to convince since joining United from Inter Milan and Ruben Amorim recently warned the goalkeeper that his place as the No.1 is under threat. \"Andre is like the other players,\" Amorim said ahead of United's opening game against Arsenal.",
      "\"They all have to win their place, so I'm not going to say if one player is No.1. He's ready to go to the game, so let's wait. Me as a coach and the players can do better than last year - and I have full confidence in that.\"",
      "Onana has conceded 148 goals in his two seasons at United and the Red Devils have been linked with a number of potential replacements so far this summer. However, they have primarily focused on strengthening their attack.",
      "More than £200million has been spent on forwards Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while teenage left-back Diego Leon has also joined from Cerro Porteno.",

      "Manchester United host Arsenal at Old Trafford in a match with multiple narratives unfolding. One of the most significant stories will be the reunion of Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim and the Gunners' star striker signing Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The pair wreaked havoc together at Sporting Lisbon. Following Gyokeres' stunning hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League - Amorim's farewell home match as Sporting boss - it seemed inevitable he would follow him to Old Trafford.",
      "United were ready to go toe-to-toe with Arsenal in the battle for Gyokeres' signature, but the former Coventry City ace had his heart set on a move to the Emirates Stadium. He made his intentions crystal clear when questioned about his choice shortly after the official announcement.",
      "He said: \"There were other clubs, of course, but this wasn't a hard choice. I chose Arsenal. When I was playing against Arsenal last season [in the Champions League], I could really feel it was a very strong team and very difficult to play against.",
      "\"That made me choose Arsenal, and of course all the history the club has and the massive fanbase. It's been amazing to see all the support that they have already given me before I even arrived. That's what it's all about. It's going to be very nice to see them in the stadiums as well.\"",
      "Reports from Portuguese outlet Record claimed Gyokeres' agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, was left \"hurt\" by the United boss. As well as representing the Arsenal striker, he also looks after former United defender Victor Lindelof.",
      "Following eight years at Old Trafford, the Red Devils decided against offering the ex-Benfica centre-back fresh terms, leading to his departure on a free transfer. It's understood Lindelof was keen to remain and battle for his position, but Amorim chose to release the 31-year-old.",
      "This move reportedly left Cetinkaya \"upset\". At the time, it was claimed the door has been closed for a potential switch to Old Trafford for Gyokeres following Lindelof's departure.",
      "It proved irrelevant as it became clear the striker favoured Arsenal. United had also already dismissed themselves from pursuing him before securing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Gyokeres started making a name for himself at Coventry City, but his time under Amorim is what saw him become one of the most talked-about players in world football. Despite his admiration for the United manager, he confessed he was left stunned by his exit.",
      "He has previously said: \"It was a shock. It's never happened to me to see a manager leave in the middle of the season when everything was going well. It was surprising, but I totally understand his decision.\"",
      "Amorim also delivered some frank remarks about Gyokeres when quizzed about speculation surrounding the striker back in April. He appeared to hint the forward would not have fancied a switch to United unless they secured Champions League football.",
      "The Red Devils boss said: \"I didn't talk to Viktor. But if a player only wants to join Manchester United to play Champions League then that player will not come to Manchester United. We want players who want to represent United and not players who want to play only certain competitions.\"",
      "For better or worse, Amorim has relentlessly attempted to drill his tactical blueprint into United. Whilst there were occasions when it appeared the Portuguese manager was creating unnecessary difficulties by persisting with his 3-4-3 system, he's remained committed to the approach which delivered silverware at Sporting.",
      "If anyone flourished and thrived under Amorim's methods, it was Gyokeres. Previously, the striker acknowledged this himself in another interview.",
      "He said: \"We won two championships in a row, for the first time in 71 years. It's an incredible achievement, and of course, Ruben Amorim played a big role in that. I can't thank him enough. The style of play we had under his orders suited me perfectly.\"",
      "If Gyokeres had opted for United, his remarks about his ex-manager's playing style hint that he would have been optimistic about making a name for himself at Old Trafford. But a different story will now unfold, beginning with their reunion.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres insisted there were “no hard feelings” when Ruben Amorim decided to abandon Sporting CP midway through last season. Amorim made the switch from the Jose Alvalade Stadium to Old Trafford in November last year while Sporting were still top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga.",
      "Gyokeres was left to spearhead the team without the manager that brought him to the club and, despite a rocky initial period, helped the side defend their league title and won the Taca de Portugal. Last month, Gyokeres followed his former boss to the Premier League, but opted to join rivals Arsenal over Amorim’s Manchester United.",
      "The Swedish striker’s £64million fee means he arrives with huge expectations to perform under Mikel Arteta as the Gunners look to go one better than their second-placed finishes over the past three seasons. As if Gyokeres’ debut coming on Sunday against United at Old Trafford wasn’t enough pressure, all eyes will be on his performance against the team and manager he effectively rejected.",
      "Amorim will know all too well of the threat the 27-year-old poses, as Gyokeres scored his first goal in an Arsenal shirt during the pre-season win over Athletic Club last weekend. And to make the two English giants’ 2025/26 Premier League opener even more interesting, United have since signed former Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There is likely to be a warm embrace between Amorim and Gyokeres despite some Sporting players being upset by the manner of his departure last autumn. After United forked out £11m to release him from his contract, the 40-year-old tactician did not officially start at Old Trafford until 11 days later, remaining with the Portuguese side to oversee clashes against Estrela, Manchester City in the Champions League, and Braga.",
      "After a 4-2 comeback win in his farewell against Braga, wing-back Geny Catamo told Bar Da Liga the players were distraught that their manager was leaving after such a momentous victory, saying: \"We were all celebrating in the locker room when he came in and announced he was indeed going to Manchester United. We were sad and cried. Most players cried. I believe I was one of those who cried the most that day.\"",
      "Gyokeres, though admitting his sadness upon hearing the news, made it clear that he didn’t harbour any resentment towards the young manager leaving in an interview with SIC earlier this year.",
      "The striker said: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Gyokeres’ comments came despite his agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, previously stating Amorim was the main reason his client joined Sporting two summers ago. Cetinkaya also revealed that a number of Premier League clubs were interested in signing the Sweden international last summer following his outstanding breakthrough season, but Gyokeres opted to stay due to Amorim remaining in charge.",
      "His soft stance on Amorim's exit may have also been a subtle indication that he was already planning his own exit, while his more distraught team-mates knew they'd be staying put. That, along with his agent's comments, mean it comes as no surprise that he too decided to leave this summer. Sunday’s clash provides the perfect chance for both Amorim and Gyokeres to prove a point to one another.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Arsenal need this season to be their season, while Manchester United just need theirs to not be a mess.",
      "Both sides collide in the headline act on the opening weekend of the 2025-26 Premier League, with new signings on both sides desperate to impress. Ruben Amorim has remodelled the United attack by adding Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta hopes he's finally landed the No.9 the club have craved in the shape of Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "It may be just the first game of the season but there already feels like there is a lot on the line for both, so we asked our team how they see the game going.",
      "Mikel Arteta may have been wrong about Arsenal having more Premier League points than anyone else in the past three seasons, but one thing the Spaniard isn't mistaken about is that it's win or bust for the Gunners this season.",
      "The Spaniard has been backed to strengthen again in the summer and now has the No.9 he wants in Viktor Gyokeres. Where Arsenal are concerned, there is no more building. They simply have to win the title now.",
      "Of course, that doesn't mean they will. Liverpool and Manchester City, perhaps even Chelsea, will have a major say. But anything other than the trophy for Arteta isn't quite enough. Whether they live up to that pressure, we'll have to wait and see.",
      "United have made major changes over the summer. Those new signings will be looking to gel quickly for Ruben Amorim, himself under pressure to ensure that last season's 'free hit' doesn't extend into 2025-26.",
      "But on opening day, expect Arsenal to look to lay down a marker and do just that. I'd expect them to be too strong at Old Trafford and issue a statement of intent. Prediction: Man Utd 1 Arsenal 3",
      "Arsenal have been dealt a tough start to the season, and as well as Old Trafford they'll also go to Anfield and St James' Park before September is out, while they'll host Manchester City as well",
      "For Mikel Arteta it could come to represent an uncomfortable flashback to last season, and the pressure really is on the Gunners to start well and look as though this year could finally be the year.",
      "There's pressure on Ruben Amorim as well of course, there always is when you manage Manchester United, but its isn't quite the same. United fans are desperate to see progress, and so they'll be cheering on anything and everything positive that they see on Sunday. The atmosphere will be quite intense.",
      "There have been some truly woeful United teams in recent years, but Arsenal have still only won twice at Old Trafford since 2006. They don't like going there, and this will be a difficult day for them. Prediction: Man Utd 1 Arsenal 1",
      "Rarely do United start the Premier League season with a defeat and I don’t think we’ll see one today. Ruben Amorim’s team have had an injection of attacking talent and they’ll surely be more used to his system after a summer on the training ground.",
      "United’s new front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha - if they all start - will be difficult to handle for Arsenal, who won’t have been able to study them as a trio. I of course have to balance that with the fact that the Gunners are the best team in the country when it comes to defending, so I can’t seem them getting blown away.",
      "I’m going for a draw which will have the home side feeling optimistic for the season ahead and puts early pressure on Mikel Arteta. 1-1 with goals from Bruno Fernandes and Gabriel Martinelli. Prediction: Man Utd 1 Arsenal 1",
      "Let’s not forget, Manchester United were truly awful last season. Arsenal were far from that. While they’ve not managed to get to where they want to be just yet, the Gunners simply know what they are doing under Mikel Arteta. And they’ve now got the missing link that they’ve been needing for some time: Viktor Gyokeres. It’s really hard to envisage a situation where United manage to stop Arsenal from scoring given the amount of talent they have in their attack. And that will immediately put the hosts on the backfoot. Fans will point to United’s outlay on their attack as reason for optimism - and that should certainly make them better this season. But it won’t come right away, it might take time for all of their big name new signings to gel. That’s something they can’t afford if they’re to get a result against the Gunners. So, it’s tough to see past a relatively straight-forward Arsenal win at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Prediction: Man Utd 0 Arsenal 2",
      "After the seemingly never-ending striker transfer sagas both Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have got their men - actually they got each other's top targets. And if narrative has taught us anything it will be down to Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko to send the other club a message. Other tired cliches are available.",
      "Arsenal are currently the more cohesive unit, however Old Trafford has not been a happy hunting ground for the Gunners having won just two of their last 18 Premier League games there. Manchester United have added £200m worth of talent to their squad and have looked good throughout pre-season. But it may not be quite enough to take all three points.",
      "United and Arsenal have drawn each other in each of their last two meetings and I expect them to repeat that again. Prediction: Man Utd 2 Arsenal 2",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Eyes will be firmly on Benjamin Sesko when Manchester United host Arsenal in their Premier League curtain-raiser. The Slovenian is set for his Red Devils debut against the Gunners, who themselves chased his signature for months.",
      "This season, the 22-year-old will be leading Ruben Amorim's frontline with the heavy burden of a price tag worth £66.4million with potential add-ons of up to £7.6m on his shoulders. The precocious forward is widely considered to be one of the most exciting young players in Europe.",
      "Now the pressure is as high as it possibly can be, particularly with United in dire need of improvement after a woeful campaign last season. However, if the comments of his former team-mates are anything to go by, the striker certainly has the temperament to succeed.",
      "Sesko was not the only new forward to arrive at Old Trafford. Former Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo joined in a deal worth £71m. In one of his first interviews at United, Mbeumo gave his thoughts on Sesko's early contributions to the group, saying: \"He looks like a cool guy.",
      "\"We’re just being normal, just having normal conversations. He’s a good guy. I think it’s important [to help people settle], especially when you come from another league and you don’t really know [things here].",
      "\"I think it’s important to make them feel at home already. I think everyone is doing this naturally, we don’t really calculate anything, but I think this is really important.\"",
      "Sesko and Erling Haaland both made their breakthroughs while playing for RB Salzburg, so comparisons between the two were inevitable. Interestingly, he once claimed many of his former colleagues told him he is a better player than the Manchester City hitman, saying: \"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "He was reminded of that particular comment during an interview with the The Telegraph. Instead of backing it up, Sesko rowed back on the quote, perhaps with a view of trying to appear more humble. He said: \"What should I say? This is comparing me to someone who is one of the best players in the world.",
      "\"So, it’s not easy to compare. I would not like to compare myself to anyone. I would just love to be myself and be the best myself.”",
      "United fans will be encouraged by his comments, as it shows he is not looking to get ahead of himself and put himself above other top players, before he has even kicked a ball in the Premier League.",
      "Of course, the performances Sesko will be measured by will be his displays at Old Trafford and the rest of the Premier League grounds. However, one comment from his former colleague Ridle Baku will be a huge green flag for United fans.",
      "Many great players such as Eden Hazard were often considered as terrible and lazy trainers, but made up for it with their performances in games. While the latter remains to be seen in the Premier League, many of Sesko's past colleagues have said they've been impressed by his performances and attitude in training sessions.",
      "Baku told FourFourTwo: \"Our striker Sesko, I was really impressed, to be honest. The first training session, I knew already that he's a good player.",
      "\"But I'm speaking about potential, probably he's not [currently at] potential he could be, but right now, what I saw already, very impressive. He has everything to be a world-class player.\"",
      "Throughout his time at RB Leipzig, Sesko mostly played with experienced Danish forward Yussuf Poulsen. Despite playing with the likes of Christopher Nkunku, Timo Werner and Alexander Sorloth, who all have impressive goalscoring records, Poulsen placed Sesko above all of those.",
      "However, he also admitted the forward is a great player to play alongside, suggesting Sesko is not a selfish player who could grate against his team-mates. Speaking to TNT in December, Poulsen said: \"As a striker, he's the best I've played with. If you look at his abilities, he has everything a top number 9 needs.",
      "\"He's still young, he still needs to learn, not the technical things about being a striker but maybe more the finesse side. He has everything, strength shooting, technique, everything.",
      "\"I like working with him and I'm trying to get him there – he'll go on and score a lot of goals for us and some point go to the club he'll love to play for.\"",
      "There was plenty of attention on Sesko's transfer saga, but he made few headlines in comparison to fellow strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak. Gyokeres went on strike to force through a move to Arsenal, while Isak has told Newcastle United he will not play for them again, in order to try and secure a move to Liverpool.",
      "However, Sesko did not go out of his way to barrage his way out of Leipzig. While the Bundesliga side did make him train on his own, the Slovenian never went on strike or threatened to take firm action against his side.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to get to know the players and talk with everybody before we brought players into our group. That is going to be a rule and will be massive in our decision to sign a player.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s long wait for the new season is nearly over. There’s just a few hours to go until the Red Devils take on Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been hard at work getting his squad prepared as he attempts to improve on the club’s rotten form from last season. One way he has gone about that is splashing the cash in the transfer market.",
      "United have spent over £200m this summer in an effort to bolster the club’s attack - Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all having signed. And despite that outlay, Amorim’s side might not be done there.",
      "They are still after a new midfielder amid links with Brighton star Carlos Baleba. There might also be exits to thrash out, with Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund all primed for the exit door.",
      "With that being said, take a look at the latest transfer news and rumours coming out of Old Trafford over the past 24 hours:",
      "Carlos Baleba is reportedly still keen to secure a move to Man United despite Brighton’s hard-line stance. The Seagulls have made it known over the past couple of days that they do not want to sell the midfielder under any circumstances.",
      "It is suggested that Baleba would be willing to bide his time as he is aware that he is still developing. But he is still keen to keep pushing over the next 12 months to secure a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking ahead of this weekend’s Premier League opener vs Fulham, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler said: \"I didn't see any change [in Baleba]. He only changed his hair, so I think that was the only change he made the last two weeks. But overall, he seems to be in a really good place. He's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player.",
      "\"He's very grateful to have the process he had in the last season, so I didn't see any big change. And he's an option to start for tomorrow.\"",
      "Man United icon Gary Neville has revealed his surprise at the club’s huge transfer outlay this summer - but still thinks there is one glaring weakness. He said: “Mbeumo, Cunha, Sesko – a lot of eyes on them at United I think Manchester United fans, including myself, are surprised they’ve gone and spent that level of money.",
      "“We thought that obviously after the Europa League final, that the money wouldn’t be there at that level. So to get those three players, who look like a really good profile – two of them have Premier League experience – we need them to do well, because the rest of the team…",
      "“We need a goalkeeper. There are definitely issues with the defence and midfield. But if the three strikers are a real handful and are scoring goals… last season United’s return in front of goal was really poor, so it’s really important that Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha get off to a really good start.”",
      "The agent of Benjamin Sesko has revealed that he was willing to give up his part of the fee in order to push through a move to Man United. Speaking on Slovenian outlet POP! TV's 24UR programme via GOAL Elvis Basanovic said: \"At one point the clubs (United and Leipzig) were far apart on the valuation.",
      "“United had reached the limit of their budget for the transfer. On the other side Leipzig had demands and expectations which were higher based on Benjamin's value. That created a gap that needed to be solved.",
      "\"At one point I decided to give up part of my own fee, to bridge the gap, because I felt it was the right thing to do. For me, a player's wishes and dreams should always come before the agent's interests.\"",

      "Jurrien Timber turned his summer holiday into a world tour - until Arsenal told him to stay at home. The Dutch full-back’s whistle-stop travel odyssey took him to Turkey, Curacao, Miami, Marbella and the Asian hinterlands and he grinned: “I have seen the whole world in two months.”",
      "But the Gunners, who sent a fitness trainer with Timber on some of his overseas trips, stepped in and asked him to stop getting his passport stamped. On Sunday he joins Arsenal’s latest crusade to go one better than runners-up in the last three seasons in an opening-day headline clash against Manchester United with his ankle problem healed and £200million of new team-mates to boost their charge.",
      "Timber explained: “I had surgery at the end of last season, an ankle operation to take something out that was bothering me for a long time towards the of the season, but I feel good now. I could not sit still during the summer to get fit, so I went to a lot of nice places. At the same time I was doing rehab. I have been to Turkey and Curacao, where my mum is from. I went with the family which was nice.",
      "“I went to Miami for a couple of days and also Marbella. It was good - and I went to Asia, of course. I have seen the whole world in two months. Someone was with me from the club and I had more places to go, but the club said, ‘That is too much!’",
      "“At the beginning I was on crutches so I could not do much, but when I was off crutches I had someone with me.”",
      "Timber’s mobility and versatility made him a vital component of the Premier League ’s meanest defence last season - just 34 goals shipped in 38 games, seven fewer than champions Liverpool.",
      "The Gunners will need to be miserly again over the next nine months and Timber admitted: “I did not realise that had the best record. We know we were defending well and doing well as a unit but we were focusing on ourselves. We have a lot of good defenders and we defend with the whole team. The amount of defenders we have at the back, the competition is amazing and it makes each other better.”",
      "Arsenal’s first six league games include dates with United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle - and there is a perception that their title challenge will be defined before the end of September.",
      "Timber said: “It is a tough beginning, isn’t it? But I think last season we also had a tough start last season and it can go both ways. If you start well, it can be amazing. That is the challenge. But I think we also need to have that approach of it being another game we need to win. That is the best way to approach it.",
      "\"Arsenal have shown the last couple of years already that we will always be fighting for the title. And every year they are trying to strengthen the squad, this summer as well. We have an amazing group and a group to do amazing things. You can tell we are close, it is just that last step.",
      "“There is nothing more you can do than just go for it and fight for it all the way. We have the manager for it, we have the team for it, we have the club for it. That is the reason why everyone is so excited to start again. Give it all because we know we have the chance.",
      "\"I think everyone's expecting a lot from them this season. Chelsea are looking amazing and there are so many good teams, it is going to be tough for sure.",
      "“That's why it is so important to focus on ourselves and believe in what we can do. We can't look at too many teams and what is happening around the league. I don't think that would be good for us or for anyone.”",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United’s route back to the top must be paved with Old Trafford victories. The Theatre of Dreams became the Theatre of Nightmares last season, with United losing nine of their 19 home games in the Premier League, conceding 28 goals and scoring just 23.",
      "Amorim knows his team must turn their stadium into a fortress if they are going to once again challenge at the top of the table - and he revealed that the club’s £210million spending spree to forge an attack that will consist of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo was driven by a desire to bring some thrills back to Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “We’ve got to make it (Old Trafford) an enjoyable place for our fans. That is really important. We start with one game against Arsenal, a very good team. Everyone in this room thinks Arsenal are going to win. I know that. But we will be there on Sunday to change things.",
      "“It’s not a mental thing - but it’s not just the players, it’s also the fans. In the (friendly) game against Fiorentina you could feel it. The fans were a little bit nervous. This feeling, you cannot change it in one day or one game. It’s a feeling that we have to fight. Everyone together - the players, the coaches and the fans. Together we are going to change things.",
      "“If you want to win things and be a very strong team, then especially at home you have to win games.”",
      "United endured their worst top-flight season for 51 years, with Amorim unable to halt the slide after succeeding Erik ten Hag in November. Sesko has been signed from RB Leipzig for £73.6million - and the 22-year-old Slovakian’s arrival is likely to signal the departure of £72million flop Rasmus Hojlund to Inter Milan.",
      "Mbeumo arrived from Brentford in a £71million package after United started the summer by triggering Cunha’s £62.5million buy-out clause at Wolves. Amorim believes his terrific trio can conjure up the magic to win games even when his team are second best.",
      "He said: “I know that in some moments we are going to struggle because it’s a game against Arsenal. But we are more prepared and I feel we have more players who can help, in one moment, to change the momentum of the game.",
      "“That gives you confidence. We have more options. If things are not working well, we can change. That gives me more confidence in every game. It’s that feeling that even if we struggle here and there in the way we play, we can still score.",
      "“Cunha can catch the ball and do something. Bryan can make one run and be there to score a goal. These kinds of things can help us a lot.”",
      "Amorim feels he has been able to put his fingerprint on the United team, with disruptive influences like Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho either booted out of the club or banished from the first-team picture. But he insists that the levels of expectation remain unchanged.",
      "He added: “Since the first moment the team was my responsibility - and I feel the same. I am always under pressure to perform. It’s impossible to be here and not feel the pressure every day. I am just more confident that we can do it.",
      "“We are ready for the season. We prepared well in pre-season. Now we start, we are going to struggle, but whatever you see on Sunday, we are going to improve during the season.",
      "“We are prepared to win against Arsenal - and that’s the only thing that matters.”",

      "Andre Onana has been warned by Ruben Amorim that his place as Manchester United's No.1 is under threat. Onana had a nightmare campaign at Old Trafford following his £47.2million arrival from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023 and the Reds would have sold the Cameroon international if they had found a buyer to pay £35million.",
      "United have been forced to put their hunt for a new shot-stopper on hold - and 29-year-old Onana will start United’s opening game against Arsenal after recovering from a hamstring injury. But boss Amorim said: “Andre is like the other players. They all have to win their place, so I’m not going to say if one player is No.1. He’s ready to go to the game, so let’s wait. Me as a coach and the players can do better than last year - and I have full confidence in that.”",
      "It comes as the United boss was told only ONE player from his side would get into an Arsenal starting lineup.",
      "Onana has conceded a staggering 148 goals in his two seasons in Manchester. In 72 Premier League appearances he has been beaten 102 times. Amorim had hoped United’s board would sanction a move for a new keeper this summer after dropping Onana during a dodgy spell in April that culminated in a horror show in the Europa League draw at Lyon.",
      "But it was decided that other areas of Amorim’s team needed improving first - and the club have lavished £210million on forwards Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo.",

      "When Manchester United host Arsenal on Sunday, Benjamin Sesko might well be wondering about what might have been. The £74million striker could make his debut for the Red Devils - but had things been different, he could well have been lining up for Mikel Arteta's title hopefuls.",
      "Sesko eventually moved to the Premier League earlier this month from RB Leipzig, becoming the third expensive forward signed by the Red Devils this summer, after £62.5m Matheus Cunha and £71m Bryan Mbeumo. It is that attack on which Ruben Amorim is pinning United's hopes of a much-improved campaign.",
      "But at the start of summer, the 22-year-old was No.1 on Arsenal's list of striker targets. However, the Gunners eventually pulled out of a move, baulking at the total cost it would have taken to get him to north London, when taking into account the player's transfer fee, salary and agents' costs. Eventually they settled on a player Amorim knows extremely well, and who had been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford, Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "\"Viktor is in a different league,\" came Amorim's reply when asked about the Swede - who scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting Lisbon before his £64m move to the Emirates - at his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Sporting have good scouting because they live from the players they can buy and sell to survive.",
      "\"I think he’s a very good player. It’s not a surprise to see him with a big club in England.\"",
      "Whether they want to be or not, this summer's transfer window and the presence of Amorim as head coach at United means Sesko and Gyokeres will be inextricably linked throughout their time in the Premier League. In the months and potentially years to come, fans and pundits alike will almost certainly question who the winners and losers were in their respective deals:",
      "For his part, Amorim isn't worried about his new No.30. The truth is United's scouting staff moved on Sesko - there have been claims that Gyokeres was left disappointed his former boss never came calling - because they see a player with a higher overall ceiling. And that's something which Amorim has, within a week, already been impressed by.",
      "“I think he has great potential in everything he does,” said Amorim. “He can play different types of football. He's going to feel that the Premier League is really aggressive, he's going to learn, but he has a great potential and I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years.",
      "“That's why we paid so much money - to have a striker that will have his history in our club. The guy is always thinking about football. He's really obsessed by that and that is a good thing because you don't have to think about that aspect with that young guy.\"",
      "That attitude however has left Amorim with a minor problem. Having grown frustrated by both Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho since his arrival in England - ultimately jettisoning both within eight months of their first fallout provided the Argentine joins Chelsea before the month ends - Amorim wants Sesko to enjoy his business more.",
      "“I don't need to tell Ben, 'this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready for every game, it's like do-or-die'. With that guy, I have not that concern. I have the opposite, [he needs to] enjoy [himself] a little bit!",
      "“He's listening, and he wants to perform, so that is really good.”",
      "Unlike most that have crossed his path since arriving in Manchester, pushing Sesko to enjoy himself while trying to reach his seemingly universally-agreed-upon potential is a nice problem for Amorim to have.",

Mikel [Arteta] is very detail-oriented, he is obsessed with taking advantage of every play.",

The Dutchman wanted his players to be at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off, travelling to the ground from their homes to share a pre-match meal.",

      "Few footballers can relate to Alexander Isak's current situation better than Wayne Rooney. Like Isak, the Manchester United legend once found himself at the centre of his fanbase's fury - leading to a frightening situation involving multiple men in balaclavas.",
      "Back in 2010, Rooney told United he wanted to leave, having grown disillusioned with the club's direction. Whispers of moves to both Manchester City and Chelsea were rife, and the uncertainty surrounding his future was badly affecting his form, having scored just one Premier League goal by New Year's Day.",
      "Such was the outrage in United circles that several angry supporters turned up outside Rooney's house in the middle of the night in an apparent attempt to intimidate him. \"We had a group of lads outside my house in balaclavas at 3am in the morning,\" he recalled, speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "\"It is scary. Coleen was sat up feeding Kai and she woke me up, we phoned the police and I went down. What they didn't know was that I was going in the next morning to sign a new deal.",
      "\"I went down to say, 'What are you doing at this time in the morning, it is not right.' I think that they thought them coming to my house made me sign my new deal!",
      "\"If you have frustration, I think there's banter, and fans will have a go at players on the pitch, but sometimes it goes too far. Turning up at players' houses, I think that is wrong.\"",
      "Rooney's standoff with United was quickly forgotten once he signed fresh terms. For Isak, though, a similar resolution feels far less likely.",
      "The 25-year-old Swede looks to have burned bridges at Newcastle by refusing to play as he pushes for a blockbuster move to Liverpool. With the Magpies holding firm on their £150million valuation, Isak has resorted to drastic measures - skipping the club's pre-season tour of Asia and pledging to never represent the club again, even if a move away doesn't materialise.",
      "While Rooney's own flirtation with the exit door ended in reconciliation, the former England captain believes that ship has sailed for Isak, and that a clean break might now suit all parties.",
      "\"Isak is a top player,\" he said. \"It is very difficult for him to stay at Newcastle - I have seen a lot of things with the club's fans saying he has gone about it the wrong way.",
      "\"You don't know what they are saying at board level but you imagine they would want him to stay, because for Newcastle to lose Isak when they are trying to build and try and form a squad to challenge for the league - it is a big loss for them.",
      "\"The difference now, with all the financial fair play and PSR, for Newcastle, it might benefit them to sell him to free up money, bring more players in and actually make the squad a little bit stronger.",
      "\"For Isak as well, it is an opportunity to join Liverpool, who have just won the Premier League. It is such a huge opportunity for him.\"",

      "Manchester United are so far behind Arsenal that just one of their players would make it into the Gunners' starting XI, according to Lee Dixon. The two clubs meet at Old Trafford on Sunday and the former Arsenal defender is convinced the away side will leave victorious.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, with their 1-0 defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final compounding a miserable campaign by ensuring no European football in 2025/26.",
      "The club have responded by spending over £200million to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to bolster a front line which managed a meagre 44 goals in 38 league games last season.",
      "But despite their ambitious summer recruitment, Dixon still believes that United's team is lagging far behind the Gunners, who finished second for the third straight campaign in 2024/25.",
      "\"I’m struggling to think of a Manchester United player that would get into Arsenal's first 11. Only Bruno Fernandes could lay claim to a spot,\" he told 10bet while predicting a 3-1 win for Arsenal.",
      "\"You’d have to put Sesko and Gyokeres in the same bracket, because neither of them have shown what they can do in the Premier League yet. We need to see them here and see how they handle it. Sesko could score 10 in the first six, who knows, and then he’d walk into a best-of 11.",
      "\"But the standout for United over the years has been Bruno. He’s got match-winning ability. We’ve all got an opinion on when he has a strop and throws his arms up, but he is a winning character. He’d be getting in there, but it would be him and him alone.\"",
      "Dixon feels that, while they've recruited well up front, United have neglected their defence. \"They won a few games and while it wasn't a scintillating summer, they bought well,\" he added.",
      "\"Mbeumo’s a good player, so is Sesko, and obviously Cunha too. We know what they can do, and if that works in that little triangle, with Fernandes behind them somewhere, it should be dangerous,",
      "\"I'm still unsure about them at the back. I'm still unsure about them in midfield. Has a lot changed at United? I wouldn't say a huge amount. They look a bit top heavy. I think there's still a lot of questions.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Arsenal have signed Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke, Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga to balance their squad out better.",
      "\"If you're Mikel Arteta, you are way more comfortable with the balance of your team in comparison to United. But it's Old Trafford, anything can happen there,\" Dixon said.",
      "\"Amorim’s got a big season ahead because he's been given money, this is going to be his team. He’s been unwavering in his approach tactically, he won’t change that, but now he has to deliver results. I'm still not sure that the players he's got from midfield, backwards, are gonna help those three up front.\"",

      "The Portuguese midfielder spent a few days considering the proposition along with his family before turning it down. His decision came on the back of one of United’s worst ever seasons in which they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes said at the time that United did not want to sell and that Ruben Amorim made it clear he wanted him to stay too. But he knows that the amount Al-Hilal were willing to pay meant his employers had to seriously consider cashing in on their captain.",
      "“Obviously, I know it was tough on the club to decide that because it was a big amount of money that the club hasn’t got probably since Cristiano [Ronaldo] left, he was the last one where they got so much money for a player.",
      "“I know for the club it was tough to decide. Because on one side I’m the club captain, I’m important for them, even if at times I’ve not been great, I’ve been performing and everything. I know that in the public eye it will be bad if things go wrong. But it would be very good if things go well – if they sell me and they get more players and whatever.",
      "“But in my mind I’ve always said that this is the place I want to be. The dream of coming and playing in the Premier League, because for me it is the biggest league in the world and I want to fulfil my dreams of staying here and winning more things with the club. Obviously I know people will have different opinions – he’s 30 years old, he’s getting old…”",
      "Fernandes said at the time that he had rejected the move because he wanted to continue playing at the highest level. He also did not want to uproot his young family to live in a country like Saudi Arabia, where the culture is very different.",
      "The 30-year-old has two years left on his current contract, which pays around £300,000 per week, and United also have the option of a 12-month extension. Although United struggled last season, Fernandes contributed 19 goals and 19 assists in 57 games across all competitions.",

      "Wayne Rooney has vowed to be \"fair and honest\" as a pundit after joining BBC Match of the Day, despite admitting he wants to see former club Manchester United \"do well\". Rooney has done some punditry work since retiring from football in 2021, but his main focus has been on coaching.",
      "However, after spells in charge of Derby County, DC United, Birmingham and Plymouth Argyle, Rooney has switched his focus to the media. The England legend will be a regular on Match of the Day this season and has also launched a new BBC podcast.",
      "And when asked what type of pundit he will be, Rooney told BBC Sport : \"I think I'm quite fair and honest really - that is the only way to be. I say this as a player, a manager, and now as a pundit - it's the same values.",
      "\"The fans aren't stupid. If you expect me to sit there and try and sugar-coat things which fans can see, I don't think I should be doing it. There are some pundits out there who try and go over the top as well.",

      "\"I want to see Man Utd do well, of course I do, but I'm very good mates with Jonny Evans and I criticised him last season. If you're speaking truthfully on what you feel then it makes it very difficult for a player to come to you and question why you're saying things.\"",
      "Rooney's comments come after he backed United to enjoy a major resurgence this season, having endured their worst Premier League campaign last year. \"I still think they [United] need one or two more signings. But I think you can see what [Ruben] Amorim is doing,\" Rooney said during a Match of the Day special edition preview.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has urged Manchester United fans to keep their expectations in check when it comes to Carlos Baleba. The Brighton enforcer, 21, is top of United's midfield wishlist, but the nine-figure sum required to bring him to Manchester likely means another year before a transfer materialises.",
      "Ferdinand admits he would love to see Baleba in a United shirt this season, but whether it happens or not, he warned that the Cameroon international wouldn't be able to solve all of manager Rubem Amorim's problems. Instead, the former United defender believes Baleba would need time to adapt and develop before he can make a lasting impact.",
      "\"Baleba, he's a young kid, he's a wonderful talent, high ceiling. [But] what I would say is, it's about managing expectations if someone like him does come in,\" Ferdinand said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube show.",
      "\"By no means am I saying that you buy him and he's the absolute answer and he's the key to everything being unlocked. He's a young kid who will need to develop. He'll need to be integrated into the squad, into the system.",
      "\"He'll have to learn and understand the responsibilities of being at Manchester United. Different requirements. Different pressure. All these things come into it when you sign for Manchester United. He'll make mistakes, but that's part of it.\"",
      "Despite calling for patience, Ferdinand insists Baleba has the potential to be a transformative signing and urged United to wrap up a deal this month regardless of the price tag to avoid fierce competition for his signature next year.",
      "\"He's something different to everything we've got there [in midfield]. And that difference is something that can really push this squad on. Not immediately, but it can happen. He'll learn,\" the 46-year-old said.",
      "\"My biggest fear is if we don't get him this window, everyone is awake now. Other teams will be at the desk next time with their chequebooks out and Brighton's asking price will be higher.\"",
      "It's understood the Seagulls have no intention of parting ways with Baleba this summer and have slapped a £104million asking price on him to deter United and any other potential suitors - a figure influenced by Moises Caicedo's £115m move to Chelsea just two years ago.",
      "Ferdinand believes the fee would be worth paying, but his former United team-mate Roy Keane isn't so sure. \"I'd be surprised if it happened. Because I still think that kid, he's got to do a bit more,\" Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "Baleba joined Brighton from Lille for £26m in 2023, stepping in to fill the void left by Caicedo following his mega-money move to Stamford Bridge. He's gone from strength to strength ever since, establishing himself as one of the Premier League's most dynamic ball-winning midfielders, with composure in possession to match.",
      "He is understood to be open to a switch to Old Trafford and is prepared to keep pushing despite terms between the clubs being the glaring issue with regards to a move coming to fruition this summer. United are reportedly reluctant to meet Brighton's valuation.",
      "According to The Athletic, they aren't expected to lodge a formal bid, mindful that Baleba has just two Premier League seasons behind him and is still developing. They're also wary of Brighton's reputation as tough negotiators, with the south coast club commanding big fees for not only Caicedo, but also the likes of Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White in recent years.",
      "The financial context is also significant. Having already spent more than £200m this summer on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, United would see a move for Baleba take their outlay beyond £300m - and eclipse their transfer record, set when Paul Pogba returned for £89m in 2016.",

      "Theo Walcott told Arsenal that they would have been massively helping Bukayo Saka by signing Bryan Mbeumo. The 26-year-old left Brentford last month after he was signed by Manchester United in a blockbuster £71million transfer.",
      "The Cameroon international was said to be of interest to the Gunners as well as Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea but Mbeumo made clear to his former side that a move to Old Trafford was his dream destination.",
      "While Mbeumo and Saka both play on the right side of attack, Walcott admitted he would have been a shrewd signing for Mikel Arteta in order to lessen the workload on the England star.",
      "Saka, 23, has played a whopping 263 games for Arsenal since breaking into the team in 2019 and has lacked competition in his position for the majority of his career in north London.",
      "The absence of a player capable of filling in for him has meant he's played a considerable number of games. His lack of rest may have contributed to the torn hamstring he suffered last season against Crystal Palace, which ruled him out for over three months.",
      "Speaking on the It's Called Soccer podcast with Rebecca Lowe, the 36-year-old was adamant as he said: \"Arsenal should have got Mbeumo many years ago. That was one player I thought, 'take the load off Saka'. I'm a big fan of him.\"",
      "Arsenal fans have already received an injury scare over their prized player after Saka limped off the pitch in their 1-0 pre-season loss to Tottenham last month. Their fears were soon downplayed after he started in their 3-2 loss to Villarreal a week later.",
      "Despite missing out on Mbeumo, the north London side did add attacking firepower in Noni Madueke whose favoured position is on the right wing. The ex-Chelsea man cost £52m and is certainly highly thought of by Arteta who explained what the Englishman will bring to his side.",
      "\"We're all so happy to welcome Noni Madueke to the team,\" the Spaniard said. \"Noni is an exciting and powerful young player, with his performances and numbers in recent seasons being of consistently high quality. He is one of the most talented wide forward players in the Premier League.",
      "\"At just 23, Noni already brings experience of club and international football, and he knows the Premier League very well. Having seen the quality of Noni’s performances up close in recent seasons, we’re really excited he is joining us.",
      "\"Noni joins our group with familiar England teammates and other players he knows. He will be made to feel at home straight away. His arrival will really improve our squad - we’re all thrilled to have him here. From all of us, welcome Noni and welcome to your family.\" Arsenal will kick off their Premier League season away to Manchester United on Sunday.",

      "Manchester United's season will begin against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim has overseen a positive pre-season and has been backed with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon for the new campaign.",
      "Sesko was unveiled before the final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina last weekend. The young striker has trained at Carrington throughout the week and is expected to make his debut against Arsenal.",
      "Arsenal have also strengthened in the summer transfer window as they prepare to mount another Premier League title challenge.",
      "Regarding the team news, United will be without Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, but Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee will be available for selection again this weekend.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up:",
      "United could be one player away from their strongest XI. Sesko has to go straight in. He's had plenty of training time and there is no point beating about the bush with a new No.9. There is not a realistic alternative, either, given Rasmus Hojlund could struggle to even make the bench today.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has to get up to speed. Casemiro could be redundant this season and pitting him against Arsenal is asking for trouble. So is Ugarte, possibly, but he was signed last year to offer longevity in midfield and United have to try and make it work.",
      "Luke Shaw seems likeliest to come in on the left of the back three but having him start for United at the start of his 12th season should not be entertained as a point of principle. So Ayden Heaven it is.",
      "The 'keeper is straightforward: Andre Onana is first choice and better than Altay Bayindir.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Onana needs to be replaced, but he's the best option to start in between the sticks after recovering from a hamstring injury. Yoro, Maguire and De Ligt are the strongest back three at Amorim's disposal.",
      "There are concerns about the midfield for the season. Fernandes and Ugarte feels like the best partnership to start the campaign with, but a fresh face needs to be secured before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Amad has started every game in pre-season and should start at right wing-back, while it's a no-brainer to start the new signings, Mbeumo, Sesko and Cunha, across the attacking line.",
      "George Smith",
      "Onana needs to start between the posts and make his first appearance since the Europa League final. Yoro is a shoo-in as the right-sided centre-back after starting four of United's five friendlies, but there is less of a guarantee about who will start next to him.",
      "As difficult a call as it is, I would choose De Ligt in the middle and Heaven on the left. The latter has not put a foot wrong since joining the club and will be keen to make his mark against his old club.",
      "Amad and Dorgu should occupy the wing-back positions, and Ugarte should partner Fernandes in the middle. United need a new midfielder before the deadline, but Ugarte currently offers the best level of protection for Fernandes in midfield.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has refused to confirm who will start in goal for their opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal.",
      "Andre Onana has recovered from a hamstring injury after missing the entirety of United's pre-season schedule. Altay Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies amid Onana's absence.",
      "United have explored the possibility of recruiting a new goalkeeper this summer and attempted to sign Emiliano Martinez on loan from Aston Villa. The club will not pursue a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The MEN revealed in May that a new goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United, who could still reinforce their midfield before the transfer window closes.",
      "\"It's like the other players,\" Amorim said when asked if Onana would start against Arsenal. \"Everyone has to win the place. So I'm not going to say if one player is number one. He's ready to go to the game. Let's wait. You will know Sunday.\"",
      "United signed Onana from Inter Milan for £47.2million in July 2023 but he has endured two error-strewn seasons. The 29-year-old was withdrawn from the squad at Newcastle United in April after he made two mistakes in the Europa League quarter-final first leg draw with Lyon.",
      "Bayindir has seldom convinced across his ten starts for United but he did help them beat Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season, saving penalties in regulation time and the shootout.",
      "Amorim is nevertheless confident that Onana - and his teammates - will improve on last season. \"I think we can - me as a coach, our players that were here last year - we can do better. So I have full confidence on that.\"",
      "Last season, Amorim confirmed Bayindir would start at Arsenal in the FA Cup and that Onana would come back into the team for the second leg against Lyon.",

      "Ruben Amorim might have dropped to his haunches before kick-off if he saw Viktor Gyokeres strolling around the centre circle and Manchester United did not have a new striker in their own half.",
      "But Benjamin Sesko is ready to start. Whether he does will be debated in the pubs around Old Trafford until the team news is published at 3.15pm on Sunday.",
      "Amorim trialled strikerless sides in Manchester United's last two friendlies against Everton and Fiorentina, seemingly preparing a plan B in case Sesko did not arrive in time. He did.",
      "Sesko's private jet touched down at Manchester Airport last Thursday. He was paraded by United on Saturday and trained with his new teammates last Sunday. He has already dined in Spinningfields and San Carlo.",
      "Logic would dictate the new £73.62million striker has to start. \"He (Sesko) has great potential,\" Amorim enthused, \"in everything he does.",
      "\"He can play different types of football. He’s going to feel that Premier League is really aggressive, he is going to learn but he has great potential. I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. That is why we paid so much money, to have a striker to have his history in our club.",
      "\"Of course, we didn’t have a lot of time but he’s ready. Physically, he’s ready, that is a big component in our league. Then he is really smart, every detail he asks, he is a guy who is always thinking. He spent all afternoon here working on his fitness, we will see if he is going to play, going to start.\"",
      "United want players to stay longer in their new £50m Carrington hub to maximise the facilities. Sesko dines in the canteen upstairs and then heads downstairs to the calming treatment room for additional stretches. Amorim raved about Sesko's inquisitiveness.",
      "\"I don’t need to tell Ben, 'Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready for every game. It’s like do or die'. With that guy, I don’t have that concern. I have the opposite.\"",
      "It is rare that two of England's biggest clubs are pitted against each other on the opening weekend of a new campaign with new No.9s in their arsenal. The closest in recent memory was Manchester City and Liverpool in the 2022 Community Shield, when Darwin Nunez outshone Erling Haaland. Nunez started on the bench.",
      "Amorim is heavily responsible for Arsenal's £64m outlay on Gyokeres, a goalscorer who came to prominence at Sporting. In an era of exciting Scandinavian strikers, Gyokeres is at Arsenal, City have Haaland and Alexander Isak is burning bridges on the Tyne to get to Liverpool.",
      "Sesko has taken an identical career path to Haaland: from Red Bull Salzburg to Manchester, via budding Champions League qualifiers in the Bundesliga. Downplaying any more comparisons would be wise.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, is five years Sesko's senior but both will be similarly scrutinised. \"The physicality is different,\" Amorim noted. \"In Sporting, they have a very good group of scouting because they live from that, from the players that they can buy and then sell to survive.",
      "\"He’s a very good player. He’s going to give different characteristics. It’s going to be different if, in the beginning of the game, if we face Viktor or (Kai) Havertz, for example.",
      "\"We need to be prepared for that but it's not a surprise to watch Viktor in a big club in England.\"",
      "United discovered early in the window that Gyokeres was set on joining a Champions League club. His mask celebration is ostensibly inspired by Bane, Batman's antagonist in The Dark Knight Rises. One of the character's first lines in the film is, \"Now's not the time for fear, that comes later.\" United fans had enough fear last season.",
      "United do have a Scandinavian frontman, though it appears unlikely Rasmus Hojlund will get a kick for the club again. With Joshua Zirkzee back in team training, there is a chance Hojlund could be left out altogether from the matchday squad this weekend.",
      "Since Hojlund stopped in the mixed zone in Soldier Field, asked if anyone wanted to talk to him and outlined his intention to stay, Amorim has benched him in both of United's games. Hojlund had a cameo in Atlanta, where he kicked a post in anger. Then he did not get a kick as he warmed the bench against Fiorentina. Hojlund killed time by doing some ball juggling as he warmed up.",
      "Those close to Hojlund conceded he would have to leave now Sesko has come in. Hojlund is open to moving to AC Milan but the topic of his future was given short shrift by Amorim on Friday.",
      "\"He’s one more option. We will see. We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",
      "Zirkzee did not play for United throughout pre-season as he recovered from an injury and his only appearance in the past four months was his desperate emergence from the bench in the Europa League final. Hojlund was at least involved in training in midweek, having not been visible in their post-Fiorentina session.",
      "If Amorim is hesitant about whether to start Sesko, he may want to research how United's recent summer striker signings have fared on home debut. Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Zlatan Ibrahimovic each claimed two goals in wins.",
      "Sesko idolises Ibrahimovic. Emulating him on Sunday would lift Amorim from his haunches.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, August 16.",
      "The Premier League got back up and running Friday night with Liverpool beating Bournemouth in an eventful 4-2 victory. If that has whetted your appetite for the return of competitive football, strap yourself in, as you do not have long to wait until the Reds start their campaign against Arsenal.",
      "We shall be previewing the big match today, as well as keeping you up to date with the summer transfer window. MEN Sport understands the move for Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline, but United are relaxed about the situation and are happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "In the meantime, thoughts turn to who could be United's alternative this summer. Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is liked by manager Ruben Amorim and is thought to be on the radar.",
      "Murmurs of a return for former goalkeeper David De Gea have also been talked up, with the Spaniard having impressed in a pre-season clash with Fiorentina last weekend. There is also the small matter of sales to discuss with Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all expected to depart before the window closes.",
      "Keep across all the latest United news, views and transfer rumours below...",
      "After seemingly missing out on Carlos Baleba from Brighton, talkSPORT believes Manchester United are keen admirers of Adam Wharton.",
      "The Crystal Palace man missed large parts of the 2024/25 campaign before returning to help Oliver Glasner's side win the FA Cup last season.",
      "United are weighing up whether to test Palace's resolve to keep Wharton after being told Baleba is not for sale.",
      "According to Alan Nixon, Manchester United are considering a shock return for David De Gea.",
      "De Gea, who left United in 2023, was replaced that same summer by Andre Onana, with some sections of the fan base still puzzled by the decision.",
      "United are said to have been 'tipped off' that de Gea has a clause in his deal at Fiorentina that can let him leave for a small sum.",
      "After Brighton's 1-1 draw with Fulham, Manchester United-linked star Carlos Baleba took to social media.",
      "A post shared by Carlos Baleba (@carlos_baleba)",
      "Manchester United are reportedly considering a swap deal with AC Milan.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is known to be liked by the Serie A outfit, with Mike Maignan now said to be involved in negotiation conversations.",
      "Manchester United are considering including Rasmus Højlund (£38m) in a swap deal with AC Milan for Mike Maignan , eyed as André Onana’s replacement. The French goalkeeper is out of contract in 2026. #MUFC #ManUtd #ACMilan #Maignan #Hojlund #Transfers #EPL #SerieA",
      "Sancho has attracted interest from both Besiktas and Roma.",
      "According to journalist Secan Dikme, via Sports Digitale, Besiktas have given the winger until the end of the weekend to respond to their offer.",
      "However, no details have been provided regarding the nature of that proposal.",
      "Man United-linked Baleba took to social media to share a message after featuring for Brighton in their 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "He wrote: \"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "United had identified the youngster as a potential reinforcement, but Brighton’s £100m valuation, and their stance that he is not for sale, has forced United to wait at least another year.",
      "Patrick Dorgu has hinted that he could be in-line for a start on Sunday afternoon when the Premier League returns.",
      "United enter the new season tomorrow, at home to Arsenal, with expectations high. They struggled desperately in the Premier League last campaign after practically giving up on their domestic form to focus on the Europa League.",
      "Ahead of the match, posting on his story, Dorgu shared a custom match graphic for tomorrow afternoon's opener. While not a sure fire sign that he will be starting against the Gunners, players often share these posts on social media when they are all set to feature in some capacity.",
      "It is seen as a subtle nod to family and friends to tune in for the fixture. 2025 has been a break-out year for Dorgu after he was signed from Lecce in January.",
      "Manchester United and Jadon Sancho's working relationship looks all-set to come to an end this summer after a tumultuous couple of years.",
      "Sancho was banished from the first-team under the club's previous manager, Erik ten Hag, after claiming he was a scapegoat for the Dutchman. He joined Borussia Dortmund on loan in January and when he eventually returned to Old Trafford, Ten Hag claimed he had patched things up with the winger.",
      "After a loan spell with Chelsea last season, Sancho informed the club that he wanted to leave this summer and now it is a race against the clock to get that deal done.",
      "Football Italia understand that Hjulmand is one of the midfielders Juventus are interested in signing this summer.",
      "The Danish international has reportedly been on Juventus’ radar since his time at Lecce, before his move to Portugal. The report adds that while Sporting CP are keen to keep their captain until next summer, they may consider selling if a 'suitable offer' comes in.",
      "Having decided against pursuing a deal for Carlos Baleba, United have shifted their focus to Hjulmand, alongside Adam Wharton.",
      "As per Football Insider, former Man United chief scout Mick Brown has confirmed that Maguire will not leave the club this summer.",
      "He claims United have turned down multiple offers from interested parties. \"Man United aren’t going to let Maguire leave,\" he said. \"A few clubs have been interested and had made contact to check whether he would be available, but those talks have not been allowed to develop.",
      "\"They see Maguire as a very important part of the squad, both on the pitch and off it.He’s played consistently with all sorts of pressure, speculation and issues around him, and he’s come through that and proved himself. From what I hear, Ruben Amorim is a fan of him and he doesn’t want to see him go.",
      "\"He’s a leader and an experienced head in the dressing room for the younger players, but he’s also one of their better centre-backs every time he plays. He’s an integral part of what Amorim is looking to do, and there are no plans to let him go. As long as he’s fit, he’s an important part of the squad.\"",
      "According to Caught Offside, Man United are considering a summer move for Lee Kang-in from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "The winger is reportedly free to leave due to competition for places in France and has already been in direct contact with Arsenal.",
      "The report claims that it seems the South Korean could also depart alongside Gianluigi Donnarumma, as he is reportedly 'seriously' considering a move before the summer deadline.",
      "It's said that if Chelsea only manage to sell one member of that unwanted trio, Maresca may have to make do with the attacking options currently available to him.",
      "Reports from Portugal (via the Daily Mail) suggest that Gyokeres' representatives were left 'hurt' by the lack of a formal approach from Man United, which came as a surprise at Old Trafford.",
      "From United's perspective, Gyokeres' appearance at the stadium this season was always expected to be in an Arsenal shirt. Mikel Arteta also believed that Gyokeres' preference was clear after just one phone call.",
      "Behind the scenes, it's said that United had no interest in publicly losing a race they were never truly in.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims Roma are 'still waiting' for Sancho's final decision after putting forward a contract proposal.",
      "Taking to X, Romano added: \"United are ready to accept £20m fee on loan + obligation, they want to get it done ASAP. Final green light now up to Jadon.\"",
      "Betis' No.7 shirt, worn by Antony during his loan from Man United in the second half of last season, is currently unassigned.",
      "Spanish newspaper Marca reports that it will remain so, with no current first-team player expected to take the number. Betis also still have an available non-EU spot, meaning Antony could return easily if a transfer is agreed.",
      "Betis porting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing the Brazilian. \"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo.",
      "\"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here. If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "According to reports in Italy, Sancho's salary demands is a problem for AS Roma.",
      "Italian media believe that the deal is likely to be structured as a loan with an obligation to buy, for a total fee of around €23m. However, Sancho's hefty salary is said to be beyond Roma's means, and the club are proposing a five-year contract to spread the salary over a longer period.",
      "It remains unclear whether he will accept the offer or hold out for more, with interest also coming from Juventus and Besiktas.",
      "Man United are not planning to proceed with a move for Baleba this summer despite being an admirer of the Brighton midfielder.",
      "United first held discussions with Brighton through intermediaries before the two clubs later spoke directly. But the Seagulls made it clear they do not intend to sell Baleba in this transfer window.",
      "The 21-year-old has started for Brighton against Fulham this afternoon.",
      "Both Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton have emerged as potential options.",
      "Man United face strong competiton for goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "Providing an update, Fabrizio Romano said on YouTube: \"In case they go for a goalkeeper don’t forget the name I gave you in July. Lammens, the young goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"United still like the player, they still have him on their shortlist. They still have to decide whether they want to go for a goalkeeper or not. It will also depend on the budget and the [new] midfielder. So there is a kind of puzzle for Man Utd in these final two weeks of the window, also including Senne Lammens at the moment.\"",
      "Meanwhile, The Telegraph suggests United must now choose whether to persist with their pursuit of Lammens or change course, as Inter Milan are said to have entered the race 'strongly.'",
      "Reports from Belgium suggested that Antwerp would demand an upfront fee in the region of €15m-€20m (£13m-£17.3m).",
      "According to reports in Portugal, Sporting CP have no intention of selling any more of their key players this summer.",
      "It’s noted that Hjulmand’s €80m (£69m) release clause was only valid until June 15, meaning there is currently no fixed price for the midfielder. As a result, Sporting would now be free to demand whatever fee they see fit.",
      "With Manchester United also exploring alternatives to Carlos Baleba, both Hjulmand and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are believed to be under consideration.",
      "Sporting boss Rui Borges has already issued a warning to interested clubs. Speaking in his press conference this week, he said: \"They know the club's plans for potential departures. They [players] have [release] clauses; whoever wants to [sign them] has to trigger those clauses, of course.\"",
      "Ex-United captain Keane has warned that the price for Baleba's potential may be too high to pay. Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened.",
      "\"Because I still think that kid... he's got to do a bit more. You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "More here.",
      "Brighton have named Manchester United-linked midfielder Carlos Baleba in the starting XI for this afternoon's Premier League clash against Fulham.",
      "The Seagulls value the midfielder at £115m.",
      "Manchester United reporter Steven Railston has looked at some alternative targets to Carlos Baleba this summer.",
      "Read the full story, here.",

      "Manchester City are also thought to be looking at Wharton with the Reds believed to be keen too.",
      "Speaking to BetVictor Casino, former Premier League manager Harry Redknapp has urged United to complete sales before the transfer window closes at the beginning of September.",
      "A successful season for Manchester United would be obviously a trophy of some sort but a top six finish would be a massive improvement. Ruben Amorim has got a hard job on his hands but they have brought some decent players in, I think that the recruitment looks like it's okay and they're not finished yet they're gonna bring a few more in so it all depends who they bring in. Really the team needs rebuilding and he needs to get a few out. He's got a few there that he doesn't fancy who are not probably good around the place attitude wise and you know you only need a few bad apples at your club and they can absolutely destroy your football club and it seems to me that he has got one or two there that he feels are bad apples and until he gets them out he's always going to have a problem. He's obviously pushed them to one side. He's not taking players on the trip that he didn't feel were part of what he's looking to do. It's been bold and I like the manager. I think he comes over great, full of enthusiasm and he knows what he wants. But good players are the most important thing. To be a great manager, the most important ingredient is to have great players. Manchester United certainly didn't have great players last year. They were a very, very poor group. Hopefully they are improving this year. I'd love to see them do better.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United are among the clubs looking at PSG midfielder Lee Kang-in.",
      "The attacking midfielder has a contract until 2028 at the French giants and therefore would not be considered an easy or cheap acquisition.",
      "Napoli and Arsenal are also thought to be keen on the 24-year-old with the latter claimed to have made direct contact for the South Korean.",
      "Speaking ahead of the clash with Arsenal on Friday, Amorim suggested that Mason Mount could hold the solution in midfield should the Reds be unable to strengthen before the window closes.",
      "I’m really happy with our players, they are working really well, we have different players for that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players. Maybe Mason Mount is a player that can play in that position if we want something different. But then we are going to find out during the season. But we have players to cope and win games in the Premier League.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano has suggested that United made club-to-club contact with Brighton for the signing of Baleba.",
      "It is claimed that United, as reported by MEN Sport, were told by Brighton that Baleba is not for sale.",
      "Baleba has not told Brighton that he wants to leave but would be interested in joining the Reds if an agreement can be reached between the clubs.",
      "Ahead of the new Premier League campaign, Betfair and YouGov have polled 2,000 football fans on their thoughts for the new season.",

      "43 per cent of the Reds' fanbase think the club will end the campaign trophyless once again.",
      "According to The Sun, United are now in the midst of preparing a £50m transfer approach for Morten Hjulmand.",
      "They claimed this week that should a move for Baleba prove impossible, attention would turn to the Danish international.",
      "Hjulmand is thought to have a £68m release clause but Sporting could look to sell him for £10m less including add-ons.",
      "That being said, it seems United could be a tad short of the Lisbon club's asking price."

      "Manchester United kick off their 2025/26 Premier League campaign against Arsenal this afternoon and there is positivity in the air.",
      "With last season's dreadful season in the rear view mirror, United have had a decent pre-season and did some exciting business in the transfer market.",
      "The first acid test of that ambition will come with the visit of the Gunners to Old Trafford, who have finished second in each of the last three seasons.",
      "Here is five things to look out for ahead of the opening day of the season.",
      "United's lack of goals were a major problem last season but their summer transfer spree should go a long way to rectifying it this term.",
      "The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who scored 58 goals between them last term has revolutionised United's front three and they could line up together for the first time against Arsenal.",
      "If they gel together quickly, United could have a much more positive season. Arsenal will hope there are teething problems at Old Trafford this afternoon.",
      "United decided to sign Sesko, as opposed to Sporting CP forward Viktor Gyokeres who was the top goalscorer in Europe for each of the last two seasons.",
      "He spent the majority of that time playing under United boss Amorim and now he will be the man looking to put a dent into their early season hopes.",
      "United should have an indicator over whether they made the right decision in the transfer market at around 6:30 this evening.",
      "One of the big decisions facing Amorim is who will partner Bruno Fernandes at the base of the midfield.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has had an excellent pre-season, while Amorim talked up Mason Mount as a potential option, too. Manuel Ugarte is the frontrunner, though, given the defensive balance he will offer alongside the United captain.",
      "Amorim is keen to add another midfielder to his squad with Carlos Baleba and Morten Hjulmand among the players linked with United.",
      "How pressing a priority that is may be clearer as United pit their wits against an Arsenal midfield of Declan Rice, Martin Zubimendi and Martin Odegaard which is arguably among the best in the Premier League.",
      "United ended last season with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa and, as of yet, they are yet to win two consecutive games under Amorim.",
      "In fact, they last won consecutive games when they kicked off last season with a 1-0 win over Fulham and that consistency will be something Amorim must address if United are to be successful this season.",
      "United have won on the opening weekend of a Premier League season 22 times, which is more than any other club in the division.",
      "But they are taking on an Arsenal side who are unbeaten in their last 14 away games and unless the match ends in a draw, there may be a buck to one of those trends this evening.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United endured a miserable season last term, finishing in 15th place but with a positive pre-season and a strong transfer window, there is confidence Ruben Amorim can turn things around in his first full season in charge.",
      "An unbeaten pre-season campaign has been bolstered by the signings of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "And fans should get their first glimpse of their new front three when they take on the Gunners this afternoon as Amorim will likely unleash his new dream attack.",
      "Andre Onana has not had any pre-season action under his belt through injury but is fit to face Arsenal and should start the season in goal. Back-up goalkeper Altay Bayindir looked shaky at times in pre-season and isn't a serious challenger to the number one spot.",
      "United's back three were one of the few positives last season and Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire will be tasked with stopping Arsenal's new forward Viktor Gyokeres from finding the back of the net.",
      "Amad has proven to be adept at right-wing-back and Patrick Dorgu has looked strong in pre-season ahead of his first full season as United's left-wing-back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is expected to drop into a deeper role in midfield and Manuel Ugarte should start alongside him to provide a bit more defensive balance at the base of midfield. Kobbie Mainoo will be unlucky to miss out but is a positive option from the bench.",
      "And the front three of Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko, who scored 58 goals between them last season, should cure United's goalsoring woes this term.",

      "Ruben Amorim has changed Manchester United's pre-match routine at Old Trafford.",
      "United prepared for home matches by staying overnight in a city centre hotel before travelling to the game, but Erik ten Hag changed the routine following his appointment from Ajax.",
      "Ten Hag made the players arrive at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off. They would arrive individually in their own cars and enjoy a pre-match meal at the stadium. The Dutchman also repurposed a large hospitality suite at Old Trafford and turned it into a pre-match room for his squad.",
      "However, Amorim has decided to scrap that approach, which means the players will now meet at Carrington, eat together at the training ground and travel as a group to Old Trafford.",
      "United have confirmed they will arrive at Old Trafford at 2.45pm to face Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Speaking to MUTV about the decision, Amorim said: “I always had the feeling that we arrive at Old Trafford and Old Trafford must be the centre of the game, but we cannot spend four hours there waiting for the game.",
      "“And I feel with these facilities [at Carrington] we can be here, preparing for the game away from Old Trafford and when we arrive at Old Trafford, we have to feel the fans and then go directly to the game, not killing the momentum of the connection with our fans.",
      "“We know that we have a lot of people waiting there for us, to be with the players and to sign autographs. We will try to do the same.",
      "“So, it's going to be the same experience for the fans. But for us it's going to be better because we are going to feel, nearer the game, the momentum with the fans and we will spend less time in there.”",
      "United unveiled Carrington's £50million makeover ahead of the new season. “I have no doubt that it will positively impact the performance of our teams,” said Omar Berrada.",

      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba has issued a message after being linked with a move to Manchester United.",
      "United have been credited with an interest in signing Baleba this summer as they look to strengthen their midfield options before the transfer window closes. The Seagulls are reported to value Baleba at more than £100million and there are even some suggestions that a price tag may be closer to £120million.",
      "A report in The Athletic recently claimed, however, that United were no longer pursuing a deal to sign Baleba this summer. Despite that, the 21-year-old midfielder is continuing to be linked with a big-money move to Old Trafford, even if a potential transfer is not likely to happen until next year.",
      "Amid the speculation, Baleba took to social media to post a message to his 195,000 followers on Instagram. The Seagulls star posted some photos of himself during Brighton's 1-1 draw with Fulham on Saturday.",
      "\"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys,\" wrote Baleba in the caption on his post, which has received more than 10,000 likes.",
      "\"Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "Baleba has been handed a new squad number at Brighton for this season. The midfielder wore the No.20 last term and has now been given the No.17 to wear for the Seagulls this term.",
      "United have already been busy in the transfer market this summer with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo all moving to Old Trafford. It remains to be seen if United will still look to sign a new midfielder amid news that a move for Baleba will not be possible before the September 1 deadline.",

      "Manchester United's 2025/26 Premier League campaign gets under way later today, with Ruben Amorim's side taking on Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui are all guaranteed to miss out against Arsenal later today, while Andre Onana could return in goal after missing all of pre-season through injury. The last time the two sides met saw the points shared, with Bruno Fernandes getting on the scoresheet in a 1-1 draw.",
      "So, can United kick off the new season with three points? We used EA FC 25 to get a score prediction.",
      "To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 25 and updated the squads with the latest injuries, suspensions, and transfers. The kits from the 2025/26 season aren't available in EA FC 25, so both sides were lined up in last season's kits, while new transfers may have incorrect squad numbers in-game.",
      "We predict that United could set up in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with their line-up as follows: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Fernandes, Ugarte, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "We predict that Arsenal could line up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Zubimendi, Rice, Odegaard; Saka, Gyokeres, Martinelli.",
      "Arsenal started on top at Old Trafford, and they had two big chances to take the lead in the opening 20 minutes, but Viktor Gyokeres was unable to direct any of his close-range efforts on target. They were glaring misses from the Swedish international, and just before half-time, it was the other new striker who scored first.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad combined down the right to skip past the Arsenal defence, with the latter being allowed to run freely into space on the wing. As Gabriel came across to cover, Amad picked out Sesko unmarked in the box, and after cutting onto his left foot, the striker found the net with a curling effort.",
      "After the break, Arsenal took full control of the game, and they managed to level the score in the 66th minute when Andre Onana pushed Gabriel Martinelli's shot into the path of Bukayo Saka, allowing the Englishman to tap into an empty net from close range. With the score level, the Gunners continued to dominate, and in the 91st minute, Mikel Arteta's side were able to turn the game on its head and find a late winner.",
      "A long ball forward sent Gyokeres through on goal, but as he shot, Matthijs de Ligt recovered fantastically to make an important block. The ball fell perfectly for Martinelli, with the Brazilian sending a sweetly struck volley into the far corner to secure the three points late on.",
      "What do you think the final score will be? Let us know in the comments!",

      "Viktor Gyokeres' insistence that there were \"no hard feelings\" when Ruben Amorim left Sporting CP midway through last season was an indication that he was already planning his move.",
      "Amorim made the switch from the Jose Alvalade Stadium to Old Trafford in November last year while Sporting remained at the top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Gyokeres was left to spearhead the team without the manager who had brought him to the club and, despite a rocky period initially, helped the side retain their domestic crown and lift the Taca de Portugal.",
      "Last month, Gyokeres followed his former manager to the Premier League, but chose to sign for rivals Arsenal rather than Amorim's Manchester United. The Swedish forward's £64million transfer fee means he arrives with enormous expectations to deliver under Mikel Arteta as the Gunners look to improve on their second-placed finishes across the last three campaigns.",
      "As if Gyokeres' debut arriving on Sunday against United at Old Trafford wasn't enough pressure, all attention will be on his display against the club and manager he essentially snubbed. Amorim will be aware of the danger the 27-year-old presents, as Gyokeres netted his first goal in an Arsenal shirt during the pre-season victory over Athletic Club last weekend.",
      "And to make the two English powerhouses' 2025/26 Premier League opener even more intriguing, United have since brought in former Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko. There is likely to be a warm embrace between Amorim and Gyokeres despite some Sporting players being upset by the manner of his departure last autumn.",
      "After United forked out £11m to release him from his contract, the 40-year-old tactician did not officially start at Old Trafford until 11 days later, remaining with the Portuguese side to oversee clashes against Estrela, Manchester City in the Champions League, and Braga.",
      "Following a 4-2 comeback victory in his final match against Braga, wing-back Geny Catamo revealed to Bar Da Liga how devastated the squad felt watching their boss leave after such a triumphant result, explaining: \"We were all celebrating in the locker room when he came in and announced he was indeed going to Manchester United. We were sad and cried. Most players cried. I believe I was one of those who cried the most that day.\"",
      "Gyokeres, whilst acknowledging his sadness at the announcement, emphasised that he held no grudges against the young manager’s decision during an interview with SIC earlier this year.",
      "The forward explained: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Gyokeres’ comments came despite his agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, previously stating Amorim was the main reason his client joined Sporting two summers ago.",
      "Cetinkaya had also revealed that several Premier League clubs were keen on signing the Swedish international last summer following his impressive breakthrough season, but Gyokeres chose to stay due to Amorim remaining at the helm.",
      "His soft stance on Amorim's exit may have also subtly hinted that he was already set on his own move, while his more distraught team-mates knew they'd be staying put. That, coupled with his agent's comments, means it's not surprising that he too decided to leave this summer.",
      "Sunday's fixture provides the perfect opportunity for both Amorim and Gyokeres to prove a point to each other.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Eyes will be firmly focused on Benjamin Sesko when Manchester United welcome Arsenal in their Premier League opener.",
      "The Slovenian is poised to make his Red Devils bow against the Gunners, who had pursued his services for several months. This campaign, the 22-year-old will spearhead Ruben Amorim's attack while carrying the pressure of his £66.4million transfer fee with potential add-ons reaching £7.6m.",
      "The striker is widely regarded as one of the continent's most promising young talents. The heat couldn't be more intense, especially with United desperately requiring improvement following last season's disappointing showing. Yet if his former colleagues' remarks are any indication, the forward certainly possesses the character to thrive.",
      "Sesko wasn't the sole new striker to arrive at Old Trafford. Ex-Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo signed in a £71m transfer. During one of his initial United interviews, Mbeumo shared his impressions of Sesko's early impact on the squad.",
      "He said: \"He looks like a cool guy. We're just being normal, just having normal conversations. He's a good guy. I think it's important [to help people settle], especially when you come from another league and you don't really know [things here].",
      "\"I think it's important to make them feel at home already. I think everyone is doing this naturally, we don't really calculate anything, but I think this is really important.\"",
      "Sesko and Erling Haaland both emerged whilst featuring for RB Salzburg, meaning pundits making parallels between the pair was unavoidable. Notably, he previously stated lots of his former team-mates told him he surpasses the Manchester City striker, saying: \"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "He was reminded of that specific remark during a discussion with The Telegraph. Rather than reinforcing it, Sesko backtracked from the statement, potentially with the intention of displaying greater modesty. He said: \"What should I say? This is comparing me to someone who is one of the best players in the world.",
      "\"So, it's not easy to compare. I would not like to compare myself to anyone. I would just love to be myself and be the best myself.\"",
      "United supporters will find encouragement in his remarks, as they demonstrate he isn't seeking to elevate himself above other elite players before he has even touched the ball in the Premier League.",
      "Naturally, the displays Sesko will be judged on will be his showings at Old Trafford and across other Premier League venues. Nevertheless, one observation from his former team-mate Ridle Baku will serve as a significant positive indicator for United supporters.",
      "Many football legends, including Eden Hazard, have often been labelled as lacklustre and lazy during training sessions, yet they've always managed to compensate for this with their match performances. While it's still early days for Sesko in the Premier League, his former teammates have expressed admiration for both his attitude and performance during training.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Baku shared his thoughts with FourFourTwo, saying: \"Our striker Sesko, I was really impressed, to be honest. The first training session, I knew already that he's a good player.",
      "\"But I'm speaking about potential, probably he's not [currently at] potential he could be, but right now, what I saw already, very impressive. He has everything to be a world-class player.",
      "During his stint at RB Leipzig, Sesko primarily shared the pitch with seasoned Danish forward Yussuf Poulsen. Despite having team-mates like Christopher Nkunku, Timo Werner and Alexander Sorloth, all of whom boast commendable goal-scoring records, Poulsen ranked Sesko above them all.",
      "He also acknowledged the United hitman is an excellent team-mate, making it clear he isn't a self-centred player who might rub his colleagues up the wrong way. Speaking to TNT in December, Poulsen said: \"As a striker, he's the best I've played with. If you look at his abilities, he has everything a top number 9 needs.",
      "\"He's still young, he still needs to learn, not the technical things about being a striker but maybe more the finesse side. He has everything, strength shooting, technique, everything.",
      "\"I like working with him and I'm trying to get him there – he'll go on and score a lot of goals for us and some point go to the club he'll love to play for.\"",
      "There was considerable focus on Sesko's transfer situation, though he generated fewer stories compared to fellow strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak. Gyokeres went on strike to push through a switch to Arsenal, whilst Isak has informed Newcastle United he will refuse to represent them again, so he can engineer a transfer to Liverpool.",
      "Yet Sesko didn't go to extraordinary lengths to force his departure from Leipzig. Whilst the Bundesliga outfit did separate him from his Leipzig team-mates at training, the Slovenian never refused to play or threaten drastic measures against his employers.",
      "Rather, he calmly continued with his professional duties, which impressed Amorim. Highlighting the significance of Sesko's temperament, Amorim said: \"It is a key point in our way of doing things now. It's not just how they play. It's really important how they play, of course, because that is their job, but their character is really important.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to get to know the players and talk with everybody before we brought players into our group. That is going to be a rule and will be massive in our decision to sign a player.\"",

      "Manchester United and Jadon Sancho's working relationship looks all-set to come to an end this summer after a tumultuous couple of years.",
      "Sancho was banished from the first-team under the club's previous manager, Erik ten Hag, after claiming he was a scapegoat for the Dutchman. He joined Borussia Dortmund on loan in January and when he eventually returned to Old Trafford, Ten Hag claimed he had patched things up with the winger.",
      "Despite this, on the summer transfer window deadline day - in 2024 - Sancho joined Chelsea on loan with an obligation to buy included. However, after a lacklustre spell at Stamford Bridge, the Blues chose to pay a £5m penalty to cancel the clause and Sancho, ultimately, returned to United instead.",
      "It is understood that this would be an obligation to buy. Currently, Sancho is set to depart United on a free in the summer of 2026, so the club will be looking for reassurances they will receive that fee before his contract expires.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "According to reports in Italy, as relayed by Football Italia, Sancho's wage is the only thing standing between the winger joining Roma and staying at Old Trafford. To work through the salary concerns, it's thought Roma want to sign the forward to a five-year deal.",
      "This would see him earn £3.89m plus add-ons in his first campaign with the club. This figure would then rise year-on-year. However, it remains to be seen if Sancho would agree to that.",

      "Manchester United are likely to miss out on the addition of Carlos Baleba in the summer transfer window.",
      "The deal for the Brighton midfielder is not completely dead, but it has been put on ice as we enter the final stages of the summer transfer window. While Baleba would have arguably been the ideal signing for Ruben Amorim, all is not lost.",
      "Baleba is thought to still be keen on a move to United and is happy to wait until next year if that is what is needed. While United have a move for the Cameroonian on the back burner, they must turn their attention to an alternative target before September 1",
      "United are still missing bite in their midfield - and will want to fill that gap before the window closes. Sporting's Morten Hjulmand and Atalanta's Ederson have both been mentioned as alternatives, but Wayne Rooney knows exactly who United should target next.",
      "Back in April, the iconic ex-United striker expressed his admiration for Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton. Picked up from Blackburn Rovers, the 21-year-old has adapted to the Premier League like a duck to water.",
      "He has shown he can offer that bite in midfield, which United so desperately lack right now. Expressing his feelings on Wharton, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"Attacking players get a lot of the credit, but Adam Wharton was outstanding.",
      "\"His commitment and winning the ball back - I thought he was the best player on the pitch.\" This was after Palace had beaten Aston Villa comfortably to reach the final of the FA Cup - which they eventually won of course - and it saw Eberechi Eze and Ismaila Sarr showcase their talents.",
      "Wharton would be an impressive addition for United if they can bring him in. He is also comfortable playing in the 3-4-2-1 system which Amorim favours which will make him a huge positive for United.",
      "When United signed Wilfried Zaha from Palace, there was concerns that he was struggling to settle in Manchester and would eventually return to Selhurst Park. Having been born in Blackburn, these concerns should not be present with Wharton.",
      "The only trouble is whether United will find Palace to be any easier to negotiate with than Brighton.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "While United are not looking to complete the deal this summer, they are still interested in Baleba and are open to transitioning their interest into a move next summer. Amid this decision, Baleba returned to social media on Friday to share a picture of himself training with Brighton.",
      "The clear message from Baleba is that it's business as usual for him as he prepares for the Seagulls' opener against Fulham. That was, also, the impression given by Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler's pre-match interview when he was quizzed on the future of his central midfielder.",
      "\"Very, very, very confident [he will stay],\" Hurzeler responded. \"It's just my belief.",
      "\"I didn't see any change in him. He only changed his hair, that was the only change he made in the last two weeks.",

      "\"He's enjoying being a Brighton player. He's very grateful to have the progress he made in the last season.",
      "\"I didn't see any big change. He's an option to start for tomorrow [Saturday].\"",
      "As mentioned, United now have until Monday, September 1 to add to further players their squad. After that, the window will close and United will only be able to sign free agents until the market re-opens yet again in January.",

      "Baleba has been mentioned as a target for United - although the Seagulls are reported to value the midfielder at more than £100million. As a result, The Athletic reported that United have decided not to pursue a deal for Baleba this summer.",
      "However, if the fee is the reason why United are choosing not to sign Baleba this summer, could the club receive millions of pounds from player sales to help raise funds for a deal for the midfielder? A host of players in Ruben Amorim's squad have been linked with moves away from Old Trafford this summer and have two weeks left to go to make that a reality.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move to Chelsea this summer. There have been suggestions that United might be willing to accept a fee between £60million and £70million for the Argentina international, but that remains to be seen at this stage.",
      "Antony is also being heavily linked with a switch away from United. It has been relatively quiet on the permanent front, though, with continued rumours of another loan to Real Betis being on the cards.",

      "With their new attacking reinforcements now being bedded in, United's attention has turned to their secondary issues. Baleba, 21, at Brighton is already one of the top-performing defensive midfielders in the Premier League - and is considered to have a high ceiling which he could develop into if he were to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "It's been reported it would take a club record fee of £100million (or more), however, so much would depend on outgoings if there's any possibility of the deal happening this summer. Ex-United captain Keane has warned that the price for Baleba's potential may be too high to pay.",
      "Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened.",
      "\"Because I still think that kid... he's got to do a bit more. You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "However high they (might) think Baleba's ceiling to be, some readers agree with Keane that United should look to more realistic and established targets. Reader Itzmayor2406 says: \"I'm not in support of spending £100m on Baleba - spending similar for attackers is reasonable as that's an expensive market.",
      "\"The pressure at United is massive, look at [Florian] Wirtz for £120m who had an average game in the Community Shield and nobody really cared. If one of [Benjamin] Sesko, [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo don't score this weekend, they'd probably be on the front pages on Monday.",
      "\"That being said, spending £100m is a lot for him and with that pressure we can't guarantee it'd be a hit.\"",
      "Commenter Jungle Jerry writes: \"I agree. £100m is too much for Baleba. United can't afford it anyway. [The Bomb Squad] still haven't been sold or loaned out. United needs a top-class holding midfielder to keep things intact in midfield. [Manuel] Ugarte hasn't done it. Casemiro is past his prime. [Toby] Collyer is too inexperienced right now, but it's good to know that he'll be going out on loan.\"",
      "Sidhu48 thinks that it's the wrong time and place to be thinking about developing more new players: \"Spending £100m for Baleba will be bad for both United and Baleba. United would have wasted the money, and Baleba's development as a player would stagnate or spiral downwards. Ugarte had promise as did [Kobbie] Mainoo, and where are they? Baleba, think twice.\"",
      "MickyFinn says: \"Will those saying they want Man Utd to find the next unknown midfielder with potential, or make cheaper signings for lesser transfer fees, be patient when those players don't hit the ground running or take two or three years to even start fulfilling that potential?",
      "\"Ask yourselves if you want Man Utd to catch up to the top-four and try to compete with them, or keep finishing mid-table. Baleba has the potential to transform this Man Utd team, that's probably why Amorim wants him.\"",
      "Cromwellswart responds: \"It's about finding the right balance. Brighton have no real pressure to win anything. Anything above a top-10 finish is a success, so their business model of signing young cheap talent and selling for huge fees is risk-free. For United, the pressure and bright lights of Old Trafford is intense. Young players who would've blossomed at Brighton would wilt at United. Hopefully players like Chido [Obi], Collyer and [Diego] Leon are redressing the balance somewhat.\"",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Carlos Baleba appears to have stalled for the time being in what is perhaps a wise move for the club as the summer deadline ends.",
      "If Baleba had been a target for the Old Trafford giants in June they could have perhaps afforded themselves more time to negotiate with Brighton. As it has turned out, the actual focus has been to add to their attack, particularly considering that the club's strikers were so blunt last season.",
      "While this will have come as a disappointment for many fans, the fact of the matter is that United simply do not have the time to waste if they want to add a midfielder to their squad before the window slams shut. If Brighton are not willing to do the deal, they are best off moving on.",
      "Plus, it's clear that this is unlikely to be a final chapter in the book for United and Baleba. The Athletic understands that Baleba is willing to keep pushing for a move to United but is happy to remain patient and wait until next year if that's what it takes.",
      "In truth, this is the next best scenario for United if they are unable to sign Baleba this summer. The fact the player is showing a willingness to move to Old Trafford and yet he is still wanting to work hard at his current club, shows the type of character he is and how he shall benefit this group.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Come this time next year, the hope will be that United have made Europe so have more money behind them and, therefore will find a deal for Baleba much more feasibly for their bank balance. The suggestion that the Cameroon international is open to wait for them is a cherry on top of that cake.",

It’s no longer acceptable for Arsenal to do anything but beat Manchester United.",
      "Only one of us reckons Arsenal will win the Premier League, which is as much to do with our burgeoning lack of faith in Arteta to get the job done as much as anything, but they were in all of our top fours, while the only shred of positivity for United to be found in our pre-season predictions came from our resident Red Devils fan Ian Watson, who believes ‘they will be a lot less sh*te if they get a midfielder with legs and a competent goalkeeper’.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres vs Ruben Amorim\nWe’re bracing ourselves ahead of a fixture featuring a new £70m striker per club, both of whom were heavily linked with the other before making their moves to grant us the delicious prospect of immediate knee-jerking into labelling one a genius and the other a flop amid gloating and gnashing of teeth depending on your red allegiance, for Arsenal and Manchester United to start with Kai Havertz and Rasmus Hojlund up front. We beg you – give the people what they want.",
      "At this stage we would be picking one over the other through a flip of a coin, which doesn’t appear to be far off Arsenal’s strategy. But we do predict Gyokeres will have the tougher time on Sunday.",
      "That’s again partly down to expectation – Gyokeres is ‘the final piece of the puzzle’ for Arsenal, who needs to drive them to the title, whereas Benjamin Sesko has a laughably low bar to clear in order to be a dramatic improvement up front for United.",
      "But there’s also no manager who knows what Gyokeres is capable of – and therefore in an excellent position to stop him –  better than Ruben Amorim, without whom the Sweden international would not have got his dream move to Arsenal. Whether the United defenders are able to carry out Amorim’s orders is another matter.",
      "",
      "Manchester United might actually be quite good\nThe defence looks pretty good though. They’ve conceded just five goals in five pre-season games and that area of the pitch was rarely picked out as a problem under Amorim last season. Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven looks to be a nice mix of experience and youth to rotate in the three centre-back positions.",
      "There have been good signs from Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon on the left in pre-season, while Amad Diallo and Diogo Dalot provide very different but decent options on the right. The midfield is the obvious concern as Manuel Ugarte hasn’t got near to proving himself capable of granting United enough stability alongside Bruno Fernandes, hence the interest in Carlos Baleba as a ‘perfect’ fit for that role, at odds with the imperfect Kobbie Mainoo and the formerly perfect Casemiro. And sure, we’re also far from convinced by Andre Onana.",
      "That front three could be a real handful though. It’s about as good a trio as Amorim could have hoped for now that United aren’t able to fish in that top pool of talent. The dynamism and hunger to succeed feels like the big thing among all three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with the deep-seated love of Manchester United (or at least greater love for them than Newcastle) key to Amorim’s desire to sign them.",
      "And while an entirely new forward line could be a problem for United, with the relationship between them not yet embedded, it also makes it very difficult for Arteta to prepare his team as he has no idea what to expect from them.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim might actually be quite good\nIt became easy to forget as Amorim lost game after to game to drum up the worst record of any Manchester United manager in the Premier League era last season that he didn’t want to be Manchester United manager last season.",
      "He made it very clear to Omar Berrada when he approached Sporting that his preference was to stay in Portugal and take over at Old Trafford this summer, and said the same again when he was unveiled as the new Red Devils boss, revealing he was forced into a corner by Berrada’s “now or never” ultimatum.",
      "He made a compelling case for not arriving mid-season being the right course of action, admitting on several occasions last term amid some quite extraordinary sack pressure that he may not be the man for the job while many of us queried his unwavering belief in his principles and style of football.",
      "But he’s still here, with his reputation largely intact, after a pre-season he craved to bed in ideas which worked so brilliantly at Sporting and now at least have a serviceable chance of proving successful at United.",
      "There’s a sense of no harm done about Amorim at United. He’s got rid of or sidelined the ‘bad apples’, got a few of his players in and has had time to work with a squad which crucially (hopefully) knows what the end goal is. Could we about to see a ‘new manager bounce’ from someone who’s already been in the job for nine months?",
      "",
      "Or Arsenal might be a bit sh*t?\nWe’re thinking more about the post-match reaction here. We don’t think Arsenal are sh*t, nor do we think they will be sh*t in this game. But, because we will have no barometer for how good Manchester United are, no other games to provide context for their quality, we suspect most fans and pundits will see a United victory as proof that Arsenal have no chance of winning the title rather than say, proving Ruben Amorim’s side could qualify for Europe.",
      "If in doubt, football stakeholders take the path of pessimism, and it’s far more fun to suggest Arteta’s set for the sack than Amorim might be an alright manager, actually.",
      "Halfway through the first weekend of the new Premier League season and we already have a brand new favourite in the Sack Race. It’s a brutal game.",
      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’.",
      "Are Newcastle fans deluded if they think they can keep Alexander Isak? And without him, have Liverpool actually strengthened at all?"

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "17=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "11=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "11=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "11=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "9) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer."

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, but Liverpool want a word.",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Nottingham Forest – £122.5m\nIt’s been another wheeler-dealer summer from Forest, who have spent big on Omari Hutchinson, Dan Ndoye, James Mcatee and Igor Jesus, but the outlay has been pretty much covered by the sales of Anthony Elanga and co.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; they desperately need some transfer depth, even if the Super Cup clash with PSG was encouraging.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £132.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and even though we’re only halfway through the opening weekend there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "10) Richarlison (2)\nA surprise that he is still at Spurs to start the season, and might very well have been shipped out by now had Dominic Solanke not been injured. Instead, he started on the opening day against Burnley, and promptly sauntered halfway to matching his 24/25 Premier League goals tally while also making an audacious early bid for goal of the season.",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this weekend, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "6) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (0)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (0)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal?",
      "",
      "2) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an opening-day goal. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson thinks Liverpool should be looking to sign another centre-back before worrying about signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle.",
      "Nine Premier League players rank among the top 20 most valuable players in the world. They are joined by only one Paris Saint-Germain star.",
      "Manchester City have the most players in the top 10 as well as the highest-paid player for the 2025-26 Premier League season…",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have been dealt a double blow as they face losing two key stars over the next year amid interest from Real Madrid."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",
      "2nd – £50.4m",
      "3rd – £47.7m",
      "4th – £45m",
      "5th – £42.4m",
      "6th – £39.8m",
      "7th – £37.1m",
      "8th – £34.5m",
      "9th – £31.9m",

      "19th – £5.2m",
      "20th (Bournemouth) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",

The 26-year-old would be available for around half the price Brighton expect for Baleba.",

That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.

It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front.

      "8) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",

      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",

      "3) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",

      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "Here are five things we can’t believe happened only a year ago…",
      "",
      "Scott McTominay replacing Kobbie Mainoo\nMainoo wasn’t quite ‘untouchable’ as he started at the base of Manchester United’s midfield in their opener against Fulham last season. Amid interest from Chelsea and financial constraints which were resulting in mass redundancies under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, no-one was. But he was The Future to a greater degree than the other two members of the trident of hope: Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "He still is in so far as Garnacho is the living, breathing antithesis of what Ruben Amorim wants to create at Old Trafford as the most unwelcome member of the current bomb squad, while Hojlund remains the ghost of the feast. But Mainoo, having been a beacon of light under Erik ten Hag after scoring in the FA Cup final and playing a major role for England at the Euros, now enters a season knowing any football he plays will be out of position under Amorim, who is currently desperate to source a new midfield destroyer who we suspect will limit Mainoo’s game time to such a degree that he will be pushing for the exit come January.",
      "McTominay meanwhile, having been either the midfield bridesmaid at United – as illustrated by his six-minute cameo against Fulham a year ago – or one half of the widely deplored McFred axis, heads into his second season with Napoli as the Scudetto winner and Serie A’s Most Valuable Player, given the freedom of a city in which the love bestowed upon him has rarely, if ever, been trumped since the deification of the arguably the greatest footballer to ever play the game, Diego Maradona.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho assist for Joshua Zirkzee winner\n“What a big moment for Joshua Zirkzee,” said Gary Neville on commentary, after the £36.5m summer signing came off the bench to score the winner two minutes from time at Old Trafford. We all assumed that was the first of many after that introduction to Premier League football.",
      "There was discussion after that game as to whether it was a “smart finish” or something closer to a lucky scuff, and there’s little doubt that the thousands of Manchester United fans who jeered Zirkzee off against Newcastle just over four months later plumped for the latter in hindsight.",
      "He scored just two further goals in the remaining 31 games of his debut Premier League season, combining with Hojlund’s goalscoring woes to force United into spending £74m on a Benjamin Sesko this summer, with Zirkzee’s game time surely set to be further limited by the arrivals of Matheus Cuha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It was Garnacho who came off the bench to provide the assist, having done his typical busy dribbling thing to get Ten Hag’s side back into the game and give the cartel of United pundits plenty of ammo to claim ‘this will be his season’, while the hackneyed insistence that Marcus Rashford ‘isn’t a kid anymore and needs to lead this team’ was also rolled out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha on the bench\nIt says a fair bit about the management of Gary O’Neil that he opted for a three of Hwang Hee-chan, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Rodrigo Gomes – a right-back he fielded on the left wing – to operate behind Jorgen Strand-Larsen against Arsenal while Cunha sat on the bench for the first hour.",
      "The Brazilian who would go on to smash their club-record departure by moving to Manchester United for £62.5m at the end of a season in which he would score 15 Premier League goals. Hwang, Bellegarde and Gomes got six between them. It would make more sense if Cunha has been a bit sh*t the season before, but he also finished that campaign as top scorer with 12.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko starts\nHaving been one of Arsenal’s key players in his first season after arriving from Manchester City, Zinchenko should perhaps have seen the writing on the wall by the time his third season rolled around after the second ended with Mikel Arteta preferring to field Takehiro Tomiyasu out of position at left-back over the Ukrainian.",
      "The £42m spent on Calafiori and the return to fitness of Jurrien Timber will only have added to those fears, though those concerns will have been assuaged greatly by him being named in the starting XI to face Wolves on the opening day. But that was just one of five Premier League starts, and three of those were at the back end of the season when Premier League title hopes were lost and focus had shifted to the Champions League, with the stratospheric rise of young upstart Myles Lewis-Skelly doing nothing to improve his standing and mood at the club.",
      "And you get the sense that he doesn’t really know why he’s been sidelined – like he’s been ghosted by a lover whom he talked to about building a life together – as indicated by quite the harrowing excerpt from his recent autobiography.",
      "“In pure personal terms, it was easily the worst season I ever experienced as a professional. A player who doesn’t play is nothing. Imagine this little boy who’s dedicated his entire existence to becoming good at one particular thing and then finds at 28 that he’s essentially no longer needed, that there are others who can do the job for him. It’s not a nice feeling.”",
      "",
      "Jarell Quansah as Virgil van Dijk’s partner\nQuansah must have wondered while sitting on the bench for all but three of Liverpool’s remaining 37 Premier League games after the curtain-raiser at Ipswich just what Arne Slot had seen from him in that opening 45 minutes before he was hooked for Ibrahima Konate that caused the Liverpool boss to strip him of his badge as Van Dijk’s centre-back partner and hand it to the Frenchman.",
      "Liam Delap had made life difficult for him, but that proved to be a theme for Ipswich’s opponents throughout the season. They hadn’t conceded. It felt almost cruel at the time, but then, Slot will point to the title and the excellent defensive partnership which was crucial to that and shrug his shoulders.",
      "We would suggest that the thought of Quansah playing under Ten Hag in a year’s time as he walked out at Portman Road would have been met with open mouths and giggles, but then there can’t have been more than a dozen people thinking the Dutch manager would still be in charge of Manchester United at the start of this season.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’.",
      "Are Newcastle fans deluded if they think they can keep Alexander Isak? And without him, have Liverpool actually strengthened at all?",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives."

      "The Premier League is back, baby. To get you in the mood for the opening weekend of the season, we’ve ranked all 20 clubs by how exciting they’ll be to watch in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "20) Fulham\nThey’ve signed a back-up goalkeeper. That’s the summer. The only flicker of intrigue is the potential signing of a Brazilian called Kevin, which is as amusing as it is genuinely exciting.",
      "",
      "19) West Ham\nGraham Potter’s a top coach, but his first few months have been flat. Jarrod Bowen, an in-form Lucas Paqueta, and the occasional James Ward-Prowse free-kick are the only real reasons to tune in this campaign.",
      "",
      "18) Burnley\nTheir 100-point promotion was built on defence, and Scott Parker looks set to keep it that way. It might be smart, but it won’t be fun.",
      "",
      "17) Wolves\nMatheus Cunha was the one player worth watching. He’s gone. Unless Jhon Arias takes the league by storm, expect some dull viewing.",
      "",
      "16) Brentford\nThomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and (pretty much) Yoane Wissa have all gone. There’s still some talent here, but with rookie boss Keith Andrews in charge, survival looks tougher than entertainment.",
      "But the tough season people are expecting makes them one of the biggest talking points going into the opening weekend.",
      "",
      "15) Aston Villa\nMinimal changes this summer. Yawn. Unai Emery’s still brilliant, but the squad feels a bit samey compared to last year.",
      "",
      "14) Nottingham Forest\nLots of new signings, all attack-minded. Big fees for James McAtee and Omari Hutchinson add intrigue. I’m excited to see them, just less so than the teams above.",
      "",
      "13) Crystal Palace\nWithout Eberechi Eze, they lose some sparkle. Oliver Glasner’s style should keep them watchable, but the drop-off in quality will be obvious if he leaves.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nDefence has been gutted, attack remains strong. Andoni Iraola should still serve up entertaining football, though perhaps in the same way that Blackpool did under Ian Holloway in 2010/11.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nLeeds are back, and that’s always fun. They’re back where they belong, people.",
      "Their signings haven’t necessarily been exciting, but they’ve been very smart and point to a more controlled, well-rounded Whites team this time around. We could get some delicious managerial drama as well, with Leeds reportedly considering sacking Daniel Farke at the end of 2024/25, despite leading them to the Championship title. A poor start could see the Elland Road bosses act…",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United\nA grim summer in the transfer market, but still a squad full of players worth watching — Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Lewis Hall. Results might dip, but entertainment shouldn’t. Even without Alexander Isak, Newcastle are a good team.",
      "",
      "9) Everton\nDavid Moyes with Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye could be box-office. Throw in Tyler Dibling and I’m becoming a fully-fledged Evertonian.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland\nA proper Barclays club returns, with a new face for the top flight in Regis Le Bris and a busy summer. Granit Xhaka might provide us with a lovely meltdown if Sunderland struggle. And lots of young players from foreign leagues are in, which is becoming the norm for a promoted club’s summer window. Not necessarily to great success.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal\nBig summer signings, big expectations. Viktor Gyokeres could be a hit or a disaster. Martin Zubimendi looks superb. Just hope Arsenal don’t go full set-piece robots again, otherwise they’ll plummet down to 20th here.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham Hotspur\nIf the Super Cup is any clue, they’ll attack big games the right way by not being completely gung-ho, while finally looking dangerous from set-pieces. Ange Postecoglou refused to work on the latter and was too proud to move away from the former.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton\nTalented squad, promising coach, attractive football. They should be right in the mix for a top-five finish. Yes, that’s right. I’m going big on Brighton this season.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea\nCole Palmer is reason enough to watch, but there’s quality and flair all over the pitch. Estevao might make us forget Neymar never played in the Premier League. Joao Pedro looks f***ing brilliant. And as always, there are plenty of new faces around the place. The Blues are expected to challenge for the title this time around…",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United\nUnpredictable and capable of glorious chaos. Could be great, could be a mess, often in the same match. That’s why we love them. Kind of.",
      "Bring on a front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, though, with Bruno Fernandes pulling the strings behind them. Yum.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City\nRayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders are exciting additions. Pep Guardiola’s side already play some of the best football in the world, and these signings should make them even more entertaining. You’ve got to love a flying, skillful full-back, and Ait-Nouri is just that, while his arrival hints towards a change in style from natural centre-backs in left-back. And with natural midfielder Matheus Nunes on the other side? City should be attack, attack, attack, with Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush up front to combine for 50 league goals.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool\nChampions last season, and now even stronger. Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, two attacking full-backs (one of which is pretty much a winger), and a top young centre-back — the Slot machine is built for another year of high-tempo, high-quality football.",
      "If that opener against Bournemouth is anything to go by, Liverpool will provide us with a chaotic and very entertaining season.",

      "The two Premier League clubs then held talks, but there has been no breakthrough as Brighton want around £100million for the Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba would be an outstanding signing for the Red Devils, but a deal appears dead in the water, for now, anyway.",

      "Indeed, it’s claimed that Baleba was the Red Devils’ ‘top target’ for the No.6 position and they ‘held preliminary conversations about a deal’.",
      "Ornstein confirms that Brighton have ‘made it clear’ they don’t want to sell Baleba this summer and intend on keeping him for ‘at least another season’.",
      "What the Seagulls have indicated Baleba would cost is ‘beyond what United are willing to pay’ right now, which means a deal ‘will not materialise’.",
      "Despite the transfer not proceeding, ‘Old Trafford appeals to Baleba’, who will ‘keep pushing’ for the move, with ‘personal terms presenting no problem’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "That does not suggest he is unhappy at Brighton and the dialogue has been cordial, with United respecting their stance.",
      "There is also an acceptance at United that while they admire Baleba and the interest remains strong, he has only two Premier League campaigns under his belt and is still developing.",
      "United have already invested heavily on two players at peak age, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and an emerging talent in Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has also added that United will move on to other targets. He wrote on X: “Manchester United made official and formal contact with Brighton today for Carlos Baleba, as expected.",
      "“Clear answer from #BHAFC: no intention to sell, not even indicating a price for this summer. Man United now expected to turn attention to different targets.”",

      "United have spent north of £200million on transfers this summer. A nominal fee was paid for Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon, but big sums were dropped on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After that, the Red Devils have been heavily linked with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The midfielder is valued at £100million or above, as is generally the case with Seagulls stars, but Roy Keane feels that’s too much for a 21-year-old with just 61 Premier League games under his belt.",

      "“You’re talking about £100m, but I still think it’s potential with a lot of these players. You can’t pay £100m for a player where you don’t know which way he’s going to go.”",
      "Whether that £100million would be able to be paid by United is a question in itself. Our friends at TEAMtalk have stated the Red Devils board know it would blow their budget, but they’re willing to do it anyway to land Baleba, and will deal with the consequences after.",
      "Fabrizio Romano, though, has stated that sales – of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony or Jadon Sancho – will be ‘key’ to United offering a big sum for Baleba.",
      "He has also stated that the deal is difficult, with Brighton wanting to keep him, and they are more likely to sell him in 2026.",
      "As such, it would seem United would in fact need to get some cash coming back in before they can make a big outlay.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has also detailed how unlikely he feels it is that Baleba will leave.",
      "He said: “I am very, very confident.",
      "“I didn’t see any change [from Carlos], he only changed his hair! He is enjoying being a Brighton player. He seems to be in a very good place, enjoying it with his team-mates.”",
      "And though Baleba has been suffering with a knee injury, Hurzeler has stated the midfielder is: “is an option to start tomorrow.”",

      "“But that is a worry, 13 for a whole season, that would be a worry for me… what if he [Sesko] got 10 goals [in the Premier League]? What if he got 10? Because you just turned your nose up at me when I mentioned Gyökeres and 10 [goals], and now you’re thinking about Šeško and 10 [goals].”",

      "Antony spent the second half of last season out on loan with Real Betis. He immediately looked at home, and finished his spell there with nine goals and five assists in all competitions.",
      "It’s known that both he and the Spanish club want to reunite if possible, but so far, Betis have looked unable to drum up the required funds for the move for the United man.",
      "That issue could be taken off the table soon, though. According to Estadio Deportivo, one of the options being considered to ‘unblock the situation’ is a new deal being offered to the winger at Old Trafford.",
      "That is an option Antony is said to view ‘more favourably’ than in recent weeks.",
      "That is as it could open the door for a loan move which would be good for all parties. Antony will not want to be tied down to then sit on the bench, but this avenue should be good for him.",
      "If he was to go on loan in his current circumstances, with his contract ending in 2027, he’d have just a year left on his deal at the end of that, and United would either get a small fee, or Antony could see out the final year and leave for free.",
      "If he extends his deal, the Red Devils will surely be happier allowing him to go out on loan again, knowing there’s still a good chance of them receiving a fee in the future, particularly if Antony plays well.",
      "For Betis, a loan seems the best course of action as they don’t have to drum up cash for the winger, but they’ll be able to get him back on a short-term deal, potentially to pick up where he left off last term.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the week that Antony had been told he needs to accept an exit by the end of the week or the threat of him being sidelined until January looms.",
      "That would have been a huge shame for the forward in relation to his World Cup chances. He was in the latest Brazil squad off the back of his Betis performances, getting back into international contention for the first time since 2023.",
      "Continuing to play well at Betis would have given him the chance to stay in contention for Brazil and potentially to play in the World Cup.",
      "That gives the forward another reason to accept a contract offer, if he’s allowed a loan beyond that.",
      "Antony is angling for a return to Real Betis but his actions have reportedly not pleased the Man Utd hierarchy.",

Initial approach to discuss with Brighton ready, deal difficult; #BHAFC want to keep + eventually sell in 2026. Carlos, keen on the move.’",

      "The Old Trafford faithful may be given a first glimpse of summer recruit Sesko alongside Premier League debuts for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko, who had also been linked with a move to Sunday's opponents Arsenal earlier in the transfer window, completed a move to Old Trafford last week in a move worth £74m from RB Leipzig. Asked whether the 22-year-old striker would be involved from the start against the Gunners, Amorim said:",
      "\"He hasn't had a lot of time, [but] physically he's ready.",
      "\"He's really smart, a guy who's always thinking. He is ready to play but we'll see if he's going to start.\"",
      "Quizzed further about Sesko, Amorim lauded the Slovenia international for his attitude, suggesting United had found a player who could lead the line for the club for years to come.",
      "\"He [Sesko] has great potential,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He has a great potential in everything he does. He can play a different type of football. He is going to feel that the Premier League is aggressive. He is going to learn.",
      "\"But Ben can be a striker for United for a lot of years, that's why we paid so much money to have a striker who will have his history in our club.\"",
      "\"He's one guy who stays here, has lunch, and goes to the medical department, does the stretching.",
      "\"He is always thinking about football. He's really obsessed about that and that is a good thing because you don't have to think about that aspect with that young guy.",
      "\"I don't need to tell Ben, 'Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready, every game is like do or die'.",
      "\"With that guy, I don't have that concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit.",

      "Asked whether Hojlund still had a role to play in the team, Amorim played down claims that Hojlund was surplus to requirements.",

      "\"Benjamin Sesko is a big prospect but one with plenty to prove and his success could be crucial to Manchester United's rebuild under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.\"",

      "Saturday 16 August 2025 23:16, UK",
      "“We struggled without a reference as a striker.” That was Ruben Amorim’s verdict on Manchester United’s final pre-season game against Fiorentina. “We have a new player, so we will see.” The hope is that Benjamin Sesko can make the difference.",
      "The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.",
      "But the modern United has become, perhaps, the ultimate test of that theory. At £73.7m, taking the summer spending on their new forward trio to over £200m, Ruben Amorim has certainly been backed. That brings pressure to make it work - and quickly.",
      "Amorim has been open about the fact that he is fortunate still to be in the job, reliant on the support of those above him after a miserable run of results that led to United's worst league finish in over 50 years. The consensus is that the mood has now changed.",
      "Luke Shaw recently admitted that the environment inside the club could be \"extremely negative\" and \"quite toxic\" before going on to claim that it is different now. Unhappy players have moved on. New ones have arrived with a point to prove. A cultural reset.",
      "Time on the training ground has helped too and the absence of European football means that there will be more of that throughout the campaign. Amorim will have the opportunity to demonstrate why he was regarded as a top young coach in the first place.",
      "The summer spending raises expectations, however. United are already fifth favourites for the title. Fail to secure European qualification and they will be out of Europe for back-to-back seasons for the first time since the ban on English clubs was lifted.",
      "The challenge is that Sesko is not the finished article. For now, at least, United are not in that market. And their opening Premier League game of the season offers an intriguing contrast. Opponents Arsenal tracked Sesko for a long time, a move seeming imminent.",
      "In the end, they opted for Viktor Gyokeres. The Sweden international has plundered well over 100 goals for club and country over the past two seasons at Sporting - more than Sesko has yet managed in his career. But he is 27. A signing for the here and the now.",
      "Maybe that reflects Arsenal's sense of urgency, a side that has been so close to major silverware in recent seasons, one that is seeking the final piece of their own puzzle. United are earlier in the process, betting on Sesko to develop into the superior player.",
      "His goal output might not be as immediately impressive as that of Gyokeres, but his 39 goals for RB Leipzig in all competitions over the past two seasons means that he has scored more than anyone else aged under 23 in Europe's five major leagues in that time.",
      "It puts him top of an illustrious list, although the presence of another name a little further down it is a reminder that, as former United coach Rene Meulensteen puts it, they are doing \"basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\" with this signing.",
      "That is to say, United are spending big hoping to develop their own elite forward. Hojlund scored nine for Atalanta in Serie A prior to his arrival. Joshua Zirkzee managed 11 for Bologna before signing the following summer. For Sesko, it was 13 at Leipzig.",
      "That might temper the expectations a little. But speak to others and they will tell you that Sesko has better instincts. He is a player capable of finding space in the penalty box, someone who can get his shots away unusually quickly for a player of his size.",
      "He is not yet Alexander Isak and that is reflected in the price tag. But Isak was 22 years old, as Sesko is now, when he arrived in the Premier League after a season in which he scored six times in 32 games for Real Sociedad in LaLiga. That is the trajectory to target.",
      "Making it happen is the difficult part and it is now Amorim's job to help Sesko succeed where so many in a United shirt have struggled in recent years and fulfil his potential. Flanked by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, there is at least creativity around him.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are strong ball carriers who draw others towards them, creating space. \"It is going to be special,\" said Amorim of his two new wide forwards after the Fiorentina game. \"I think that they are maybe at 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.\"",
      "Another word of caution, though. There is some risk that the opposite is true. There were only three players in the Premier League who outperformed their expected goals by six or more last season. One was Chris Wood. The other two were Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Of the 10 previous players to have done that over the past eight years, only Heung-Min Son has scored more goals in the following season - and he dipped dramatically the year after. The vast majority of players have seen their goal output regress to the mean.",
      "One of the reasons cited for Liverpool's signing of Hugo Ekitike is that he actually underperformed his expected goals - they recognised the potential for his numbers to explode. United appear to have gone the opposite route, trying to sign elite finishers.",
      "Sesko could fall into that category having scored 27 Bundesliga goals over the past two seasons from chances with an expected-goals value of just 17.6. Could he be another Son, another Harry Kane, who consistently finishes better than the metrics suggest?",
      "If so, it could define United's season and with it Amorim's reign. There are other factors, of course. The balance in midfield is a concern and the wing-backs will be key. But it is this new forward line that will probably dictate how the rebuild is perceived.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have Premier League pedigree which will buy them some time. Rather unfairly, the referendum on young Sesko may come sooner than that. A swift impact against Arsenal, with Gyokeres among the opposition, would be most helpful."

      "The Premier League's elite clubs are rebuilding.",
      "This summer has seen the so-called Big Six spend in excess of £1bn between them on new signings. With several weeks of the transfer window still to go, the numbers will continue to rise.",
      "Liverpool are leading the way as they aim to consolidate their Premier League title win but Chelsea are close to their total for money spent, with Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United next on the list respectively, and Spurs not far behind them.",
      "There is particular intrigue around the Manchester clubs.",
      "City recorded their lowest points total under Pep Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term. United plumbed far greater depths as they finished 15th and also failed to win silverware.",
      "So, are they on track to bounce back and enjoy the success their fans crave in the new season? Or is the road to the top longer? Much will depend on whether they can master the art of the rebuild, a process Sir Alex Ferguson once said he believed could take up to four years.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have of course been here before.",
      "How they would love a repeat of the successful rebuild overseen early in his tenure following his arrival from Bayern Munich, when City recovered from a difficult first campaign, like the one they have just had, to win the first of many titles in 2017/18.",
      "\"They are one of the exceptions to that four-year rule,\" says Neville.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho came into Chelsea and won their first league title in a long, long time in his first season, creating a kind of unity straight away. Pep Guardiola got a great side that won the title in the space of two years at Manchester City.\"",
      "Neville also mentions Arne Slot's achievement in winning the Premier League straight after succeeding the legendary Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. \"I would say it was a very different team than under Klopp, with different components and ingredients.\"",
      "What they all have in common, and something key to a successful rebuild in Neville's eyes, is that they inherited the right type of characters in the dressing room.",
      "\"You think of what Slot was handed last season: [Virgil] Van Dijk, Alisson, [Mohamed] Salah, [Andrew] Robertson, [Alexis] Mac Allister, Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",
      "\"They are five or six proven winners at the highest level and they have been around the block. They've got pride and ego and they are not going to sit there and use the fact there's a new manager coming in as an excuse not to perform well.",
      "\"Players can hide behind managers. But if you've got good characters and leaders, people who have standards in their personal lives, you're going to get a better outcome.",
      "\"Slot harnessed that. He did a good job with those leaders. But he is not the one in the dressing room. People may or may not know this, but managers might not go in the dressing room at the training ground even for one minute during the week.",
      "\"For all those hours, it is policed by the senior players.\"",
      "Heavy investment was of course vital to the success of those previous Chelsea and Manchester City's rebuilds. But both Mourinho and Guardiola also inherited senior players to build around.",
      "For Mourinho at Chelsea, it was John Terry and Frank Lampard. Guardiola could call on Fernandinho, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at City.",
      "Guardiola has some similar characters now in Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, among others. At United, though, Amorim inherited very different personnel to the dressing room Neville experienced there in his playing days.",
      "\"For us it was Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce. Then when me, [Paul] Scholesy and others got older, it was us. When we left, others took over,\" he explains.",
      "\"You're asking those players in the dressing room to set the standards, to make sure negativity doesn't creep in. The people who sap energy, close them off straight away. Don't let them drain you, the people who constantly whinge in a negative way\"",
      "Amorim is still in the process of overhauling his dressing room as he aims to reverse a years-long slide from their success under Ferguson. Manchester United have signed three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko but are still struggling to shift numerous unwanted players.",
      "\"This is a really unique situation,\" says Neville. \"I said before that you don't get three or four years to build a team, but because of Manchester United's relentless poor form over two, three, four or five years, it will take quite a bit to unwind that.",
      "\"Amorim has got players he quite clearly doesn't want and doesn't like, players on huge money, some of whom have cost huge money. And even if you do get them out, some of their wages will probably have to be subsidised by the club.",
      "\"So, I think he has a minimum of a two-and-a-half-year build to get to the point he wants with his unique system and buying the players he wants to fit that, just because of what has gone on there previously, but he's going to have to demonstrate progress.",
      "\"The problem he has is that you've got a top five now who like they are getting into the Champions League and the penalty for not being in the Champions League is big now because all these clubs - United, Villa, Newcastle, Chelsea - are on the edge on PSR.",
      "\"It's big for them if they drop out of those Champions League places. So Amorim has got to be relatively successful, which means finishing in the top four or top five, all while building a new team and recruiting the players he wants.\"",
      "Circumstances matter too when it comes to rebuilding efficiently. Guardiola knows that well given the importance of expiring contracts to his first Manchester City overhaul. A long list of departures in 2017 gave him space to reshape his squad.",
      "The list of players who reached the ends of their deals after Guardiola's first season included Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna and Jesus Navas. This summer, by contrast, the only one feels like a significant loss in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Guardiola points out there was a significant loss back in 2017 too. \"In that moment, we made one big mistake which was to not keep Jesus Navas with us,\" he says.",
      "\"I think he would have helped us a lot for the next years because he was a player who could play as a full-back, as a full-back inside, as a right-winger. He was incredible.",
      "\"For the rest, the club decided they needed new, fresh energy, so that's why we rebuilt. They bought some unbelievable players like Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva; top-class players who helped us start to do what we have done.\"",
      "Manchester City are having to work harder to shift players this time around. Their signings so far this summer have left them with a squad of 33 as things stand.",
      "Their plight last season shows the importance of forward planning. Could City's drop-off have been avoided if they had acted sooner to refresh their personnel?",
      "\"It's bloody hard when you've got a team that's won the treble, and a group of players who have been so good,\" says Neville. \"But they do tend to grow a little bit old together.",
      "\"It's about how you change it and when you change it when you have been as successful as they have been. To do it after a treble is the most difficult time.\"",
      "Neville sees some parallels between the plight of City's treble-winning team and that of United's in 1998/99.",
      "\"It felt like we only signed one or two players in the two years after the treble. We won the league in those years but then we saw a sharp decline and we only won one of the next four.",
      "\"You get this euphoric moment winning a treble, where you've built an unbelievable team, but within a couple of years they grow a little bit old together and you've got a situation where you can fall off the edge of a cliff and end up having to make big changes.\"",
      "Neville describes Manchester City's current rebuild as Guardiola's \"toughest job\" in management. \"You get to the point where you think, 'will he win it next season, or will it take two or three years?'\" he says. But the man himself sees it differently.",
      "\"The most challenging summer was when I was chosen to be the manager of the second team at Barcelona and prove myself to the board,\" he says with a smile.",
      "\"Then the challenge was to take over the Barcelona first team and prove myself, and after that go to Germany after the legend Jupp Heynckes had won the treble, when my German language was a disaster, to convince the players to keep going and winning.",
      "\"Then it was arriving here and in the first press conference they said, 'the club have brought you here to win the Champions League', and I said, 'wait a minute, please!' After that I was 'Fraudiola' and it was a disaster in the seasons we didn't win it.\"",
      "Guardiola is eager to point out that he saw progress even in his fraught first season, when he was assisted by now Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City finished 15 points behind eventual Premier League champions Chelsea.",
      "\"In the first season we played really, really well in moments,\" he says. \"Always with Mikel we talk about that, that in that first season we started to build something. This season is not the most difficult one because we did it. We proved we could do it.\"",
      "Guardiola is encouraged by how his side finished last season too, even if it ended in the disappointment of a second consecutive FA Cup final loss at Wembley, this time to Crystal Palace.",
      "\"I didn't like the way we lost against Man Utd in the [previous] FA Cup final. I was grumpy. This season, I was sad because we played really, really well. They know it. They knew we were there, the spirit was there, the chances were there.",
      "\"We missed something we have to recover next season. That belongs to me, it belongs to the players, it belongs to all of us. And after that we will create a team which can compete game by game and start in a better position in the Premier League.\"",
      "Guardiola stresses that pain forms part of every rebuild.",
      "That was true even for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who mastered the art during his historic Old Trafford tenure, creating a series of trophy-winning teams.",
      "\"Each transition came with a bit of turbulence,\" says Neville.",
      "\"We then lost the first game of the next season and Alan Hansen said you can't win anything with kids. So, it was a lot of pressure at that time, changing and transitioning, and that is something you have to manage in a rebuild.",
      "\"We didn't win the league for three years between 2003 and 2006. That's the longest I ever went in my career. That was a point where Mourinho was absolutely on his game and [Arsene] Wenger's football was sensational. They were brilliant teams.",
      "\"Our recruitment wasn't the best. It took a while for Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to come through, for Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra to settle in.",
      "\"That was the time where I thought, 'will we win the league again?' We did it in 2006 and that set us up for another five or six years of winning titles because that team was amazing. But the key was the foresight and bravery Sir Alex had to let players go.\"",
      "The principles behind that ruthlessness remain crucial in today's game. It is about lowering the age of the squad and striking a balance between youth and experience while ensuring there is room for long-term growth and development.",
      "\"I used to think of it as a conveyer belt,\" says Neville. \"We came in in '92, '93, '94. We were the young ones at the start of the conveyor belt and we had the older ones falling off. We eventually moved on to the end of the conveyor belt and fell off ourselves.",
      "\"I always thought you needed a group of players that were young, a group of players in their peak, and then a few, four or five, who were in their 30s and set the standards. I think that was the sort of age profile Sir Alex considered when building teams, but there was always some turbulence.\"",
      "As their respective rebuilds continue, Manchester United and City will hope the turbulence eases for them in the new campaign.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back in the Premier League predictions chair to provide his insight and best bets.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "Saturday 16 August 2025 07:01, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "By Nick Wright and Adam Smith",
      "Saturday 16 August 2025 21:22, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",
