      "Arsenal icon Ian Wright has slammed the \"two-bob centre-forwards\" who laid into Viktor Gyokeres after the Swede drew a blank in the Gunners win over Manchester United. Gyokeres, 27, made a £63.7million move to the Emirates Stadium and now carries the hopes of Arsenal fans that he can fire them to the Premier League title after three consecutive second-placed finishes.",
      "However, Gyokeres was hooked after an hour at Old Trafford in Arsenal's 1-0 victory and failed to register a shot on target. It's unfamiliar territory for the Swede, who scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP.",
      "Arsenal's new forward naturally drew criticism from a section of pundits for his sub-par performance and in the days afterwards. Boss Mikel Arteta also claimed the striker has work to do to integrate with his new team-mates. However, speaking on Arsenal podcast, 'Arsecast', Wright fired back at Gyokeres' naysayers, and has fully backed the striker to succeed in north London.",
      "“What I would say to him, bro, embrace this,\" Wright said. \"Because I tell you, Viktor Gyokeres being part of Arsenal winning the title again after so many years, with the pressure he's under now, the discourse... the people I'm seeing, two-bob centre forwards on whatever it is – I won't mention where they are – talking about him like, yeah, he's a flat-track bully, whatever it is, it means f*** all, because he's where he wants to be.",
      "\"Now, it's up to him, go and get it. Just go and get it.\"",
      "Wright believes once Gyokeres' assimilates with the squad further, it will be a matter of when – and not if – that he discovers his scoring boots at Arsenal.",
      "Wright added: \"I think that obviously as a striker, and I've been there, and I'm going to Arsenal, in that first game, you'd probably want to show a little bit of what you're capable of – get a chance, half chance, maybe take it if you're fortunate.",
      "\"And even if you play like Viktor Gyokeres played against United, and he didn't really show much, if we're going to be totally honest, we saw good running into the channels, good strength and stuff like that.",
      "\"But in respect of what we're going to need, we didn't really see that. Now, that's a combination of him getting used to the team, the team getting used to him, and Man United causing us a lot of problems.",
      "\"Viktor Gyokeres has got to understand he's now at the place and, this is what I had to realise with Arsenal, he's now at the place where all that work, all that ignoring of him when he was scoring goals in different places thinking he's going to get the move, get the next move to get to where he wants to be. All that is done, because now he's at the place. So now it's on Viktor.\"",
      "On his own journey to Arsenal and how he dealt with the pressure of his own big switch, moving from Crystal Palace to Arsenal in 1991, Wright said: \"I've never felt so afraid and Viktor will be feeling the same. But then it's down to you to draw on that, the hard work, the ignoring of you, the fact that people don't think that you're as good as you think you are.",
      "\"And you've got to continue to do that in the dark. He's here, so it's now up to him to go out there and show what all that hard work is about.",
      "\"So I would say to him, even if he scored and got taken off, it'd still be for me something where he'd say, 'Well, I'm pleased I scored there, but like, okay, I could do better,' but the team weren't functioning as well. He's just got to go back into the headspace of what he does when his chances do come.\"",

      "Manchester United remain in talks to land goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp in a deal worth £17.3 million as Ruben Amorim responds to calls to add a new shotstopper.",
      "United's interest in Lammens is also not motivated by a desire to offload one of their current goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir deputised for Andre Onana in last Sunday's loss to Arsenal, but his error ultimately proved crucial in the end result.",
      "Onana himself has not convinced during his two years in Manchester and there was talk this summer of him moving on, although he's determined to stay and prove himself once he returns to full fitness.",
      "Amorim, after Sunday's loss, maintained that he was happy with the options he had in between the sticks and any arrivals would not lead to another goalkeeper leaving Manchester with Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton currently available to him.",
      "The Portuguese boss said: \"It's not an idea that 'these players are going to leave and then we'll receive another player'. We don't know what is going to happen but we are not waiting to take out someone to bring another player [in].",
      "\"One thing is not responsible for the other. The players you're talking about are not players who are training with the group in this moment. We have a group training so it's not going to affect a lot.\"",
      "Gary Neville was among those to insist that his former club go into the market for a new goalkeeper. He maintained that it was an issue that would continue to haunt them and the lack of a dominant presence would hamper their backline.",
      "“I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney condemned Alexander Isak's efforts to force a move away from Newcastle, over 10 years on from the England great's bid to facilitate a departure from Manchester United. The Sweden international has been embroiled in the most toxic saga of the summer transfer window as he attempts to leave the Premier League side after three years on Tyneside.",
      "Liverpool tabled a £110million bid for his services, which was swiftly rejected at the start of the month. And Isak has reportedly refused to ever play for the club again, despite having three years left on his contract.",
      "The 25-year-old broke his silence for the first time this summer earlier this week, where he accused the club's hierarchy of \"breaking promises\". Isak was absent from the matchday squad of the Magpies' league opener against Aston Villa, which they drew 0-0.",
      "With less than 10 days remaining in the window, it remains to be seen whether Isak – who has been training alone – will clinch his dream move to Anfield or whether Eddie Howe will manage to hold on to his star man. He is not expected to figure against Liverpool on Monday night.",
      "Plenty have had their say on Isak's behaviour in order to engineer a move away, with Rooney admitting if he was a team-mate of the Swede, he wouldn't welcome him back.",
      "While there is no evidence the Red Devils icon refused to train or play in the two instances he requested to leave Old Trafford, he stated there are correct ways to go about requesting an exit.",
      "\"If I'm a Newcastle player, I don't want Isak back,\" he said on the BBC's Wayne Rooney Show. \"I think if players leave football clubs – and that happens all the time – there's a way to go about it. You can't go on strike, can't not turn up for training and train with your team-mates.",
      "\"If you want to leave the club or not, you have to be there for your team-mates and be ready if needed. So I think if I was a player I wouldn't want him back. He's deserted you. He doesn't want to be there, he doesn't want to be your team-mate. So I wouldn't want him back.\"",
      "It was in 2010 when Rooney first submitted a transfer request to leave United but eventually opted to stay before signing a bumper five-year deal, as Ferguson ultimately turned a blind eye to the first saga where the player had wanted to join Chelsea.",
      "It was only three years later, in Sir Alex Ferguson's last season in charge, that Rooney once again asked to leave the club, with the Scotsman confirming the club had refused his transfer request.",
      "Ferguson admitted that was the reason Rooney was absent from his last home game in charge, which was a 2-1 win over Swansea. He said: \"I don't think Wayne was keen to play, simply because he has asked for a transfer.\"",
      "Once again, Rooney was convinced to stay, this time under David Moyes, as he penned a contract extension with the club in February 2014.",
      "Despite Rooney's claim that Isak can no longer make amends in the north east, he certainly was able to under both Ferguson and Moyes.",
      "Rooney added: \"Now, Newcastle aren't happy with Isak's behaviour because Liverpool want to sign him. But then on the flip side of that, Newcastle are trying to sign Yoane Wissa who's behaving the exact same way at Brentford.",
      "\"I remember Anthony Gordon not playing for Everton because he wanted to go to Newcastle. So you can't have it both ways. But in terms of Isak's team-mates, I wouldn't want him back. Once you've overstepped the mark I think it's very difficult to come back in.",
      "\"You can ask to leave a football club – that happens – or the club tell you you're leaving. But you have to be professional. You've got friends in there who you play with, you have fans who are paying a lot of money to support and you can't just walk out on it. And if they're going to do it once, they'll do it again.",
      "\"For me, I don't think there's any way back for Isak at Newcastle. I think there are cases where it can happen, but from me as a person, don't think I could accept them back.\"",
      "Newcastle will host Liverpool on Monday Night Football in their first home game of the season, which could prove to be an enthralling evening of action with plenty of emotions running high at St. James' Park.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is another United player who faces an uncertain future and he is one player Amorim would be eager to offload to balance the books.",
      "United are listening to offers for Hojlund after struggling to impress since his £72m move from Atalanta in 2023, with just three goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "The arrival of Sesko has pushed him further down the pecking order and he wasn't involved in the squad to face Arsenal last week.",
      "Napoli have been one of the teams interested in Hojlund, but along with other teams in Italy keeping an eye on the Danish international, they were previously only keen on a loan deal.",

      "Onana cost United £47.5m when he joined from Inter Milan in 2023 but he has failed to impress with some mixed displays that have not inspired confidence.",
      "United have been strongly linked with a new goalkeeper in this transfer window to provide more quality competition for Onana amid doubts over back-up Altay Bayindir too - after a howler against Arsenal.",

      "The youngster has played 63 times for the Belgian side and featured 44 times last season.",

      "The 24-year-old has impressed for Stuttgart in recent seasons and has been tipped for a move to a big club in the near future.",
      "Last season he started 31 times in the Bundesliga for his team, scoring once and assisting eight times to show his creative qualities.",

      "“These mark-ups are less about necessity and more about blatant greed. This isn’t about inflation. It’s about clubs testing how far they can push fan loyalty. It’s time for clubs to reward loyalty and stop seeing their fans as cash cows to rip off at every opportunity.”",

      "The Cottagers will be eager to improve on their league performance having missed out on Europe last minute but with only one summer signing in the form of a second-choice goalkeeper, it will be difficult to achieve this feat. It must be incredibly frustrating for Marco Silva who has seen his side showed constant signs of improvements but has not been backed appropriately in the market in comparison to his competitors - including Ruben Amorim.",
      "Manchester United head to Craven Cottage with a near clean bill of health but a couple of big calls to make. It remains unchanged on the injury front for the visitors: last season’s match‑winner at the Cottage, Martínez (knee), and Noussair Mazraoui (hamstring) are still sidelined, while Amorim otherwise has a full squad to choose from.",
      "Marco Silva’s concerns also sit at left‑back. Ryan Sessegnon (unspecified) and Antonee Robinson (knee) missed the trip to Brighton, but neither has been ruled out of Sunday. Even so, Calvin Bassey remains the likeliest option to patrol the left of the defence if late tests do not clear the senior duo.",
      "Raúl Jiménez faces pressure after Rodrigo Muniz’s South Coast heroics. Up the pitch, Silva has a genuine dilemma at number 10. Josh King offers direct running, Emile Smith Rowe brings craft between the lines, and former United midfielder Andreas Pereira provides set‑piece quality and an understanding of the stage. The choice will colour how Fulham press and how quickly they can spring transitions.",
      "Fulham: Leno; Tete, Andersen, Cuenca, Bassey; Berge, Lukic; Wilson, King, Iwobi; Jimenez",
      "Man United: Onana; Yoro, Ligt, Shaw; Diallo, Fernandes, Casemiro, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Sesko, Cunha",

      "Roy Keane has questioned whether Marcus Rashford possesses the footballing brain needed to thrive at Barcelona. The Manchester United forward is playing his football in La Liga this season after securing a loan move from Old Trafford.",
      "The long-serving Red Devils star found himself surplus to requirements under Ruben Amorim following the Portuguese manager's arrival in November 2024. This prompted his decision to seek regular football under Hansi Flick at the Nou Camp.",
      "The winger made an encouraging start to life in Spain during pre-season, finding the net once and providing an assist in his early appearances for Barca. But Keane remains unconvinced by Rashford's prospects, questioning whether he has the tactical understanding required to flourish in Spanish football.",
      "During a discussion about the transfer window's winners and losers on the Stick to Football podcast, former United star Gary Neville said: \"Last one is Marcus Rashford to Barcelona. I know it's not a big signing in terms of the Premier League but it's an amazing move for him.",
      "\"I mean, I hope he does well. I think that him leaving is a poor reflection upon the club, but also him in terms of how it's gone in the last few years. But I just hope he can get his career back on track. What a move.\"",
      "Keane then weighed in, as he asked: \"Do you reckon he's got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle?",
      "\"Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to to make it work? He's obviously a talented boy. We know his strengths and that is running in behind. He kind of stopped doing that a little bit.\"",
      "Neville went on to suggest that a repeat of Rashford's recent struggles at United could be on the cards, given Barca's tendency to control possession in matches. He said: \"Well I think Roy, you're in Barcelona. It's maybe because I'm thinking of Barcelona 10 years ago.",
      "\"I know it's slightly different now but they dominate a lot of games whereby they are high up the pitch and you've got teams behind the ball, and you think Marcus is better when he's playing in a counter-attacking system. So when you're playing in tight areas.\"",
      "Keane interrupted Neville's assessment, as he said: \"That's why I think there are question marks, a little bit.\" Neville added: \"I know he plays off the left-hand side.",
      "\"But when United had teams that sat deep against him, you quite often saw him sort of run the ball out of play a bit didn't you and stuff and, just be a bit scruffy. But I mean look, his confidence looks like he's [on the up].\"",
      "Keane also said: \"I'm going to say hit just to try and get the feel-good factor out of it.\" Although he failed to find the net in Barcelona's 3-0 La Liga curtain-raiser against RCD Mallorca, Rashford is confident that he can rediscover his devastating form in Spain.",
      "He acknowledged his path to success won't be straightforward, as he must adjust to fresh tactics and a different division. Addressing the media ahead of the season's launch, the 27-year-old said: \"It's been a good pre-season and we're ready for the start of the season.",
      "\"I've settled in quite well and I'm adapting to the team and the coach. There are a lot of great players here - I already knew that. The quality and intensity are very high, and that's what we need to maintain throughout the season. It will be tough because it's a new country and a different league. I accept the challenge.\"",

      "Fenerbahce are reportedly willing to pay Manchester United's £40million asking price to sign Antony this summer - but the Brazilian isn't convinced about a move to Jose Mourinho's side.",
      "Antony is one of five players who were placed in Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' of unwanted players this summer, having enjoyed a superb loan stint at Real Betis. But with a permanent move to Betis not in the offing, the former Ajax player is looking for his next club after being frozen out of Amorim's plans.",
      "Antony scored nine goals in all competitions for the La Liga side last season as he led them to the Conference League final before an agonising 4-1 defeat to Chelsea and he showed he still has the quality to play at the highest level.",
      "And one of the interested sides is Turkish giants Fenerbahce, manged by ex-United boss Mourinho, who is desperate to win his first title since taking charge of the club last year.",
      "But according to ESPN, Antony remains on the fence about the move and would \"prefer to wait for other clubs\" - despite being offered a lucrative salary in Turkey.",
      "The problem for Antony, however, is that those clubs he is waiting on continue to insist on a loan deal - while United are hoping to secure a permanent exit for him.",
      "Other clubs interested in signing Antony on loan are Brighton, Bayer Leverkusen and Benfica - who all want to sign the player on loan.",
      "Antony himself \"does not look favourably\" on a loan deal, even though he had so much success during his temporary switch at Betis.",
      "The report says Betis also still hold out hope of signing Antony on loan again and Antony would not be opposed to returning to the club.",
      "Despite Leverkusen being one of the clubs linked with a move for Antony, manager Erik ten Hag - who twice signed the winger for both Ajax and Manchester United - has been quick to shut down the idea.",
      "Speaking to Bild last month, he said: \"He has great quality. I signed him twice. He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.\"",

      "The new Premier League season is only one week old but already teams have been plagued with injury problems. A handful of managers have been handed dilemmas and some might even turn to the transfer window to solve them.",
      "Champions Liverpool are latest to be affected after new signing Jeremie Frimpong suffered a hamstring injury and won't be back until after the first international break in mid-September.",
      "And fellow title-chasers Arsenal have also been handed a set-back after news that Kai Havertz has a knee injury that should keep him out for a spell.",
      "The problem is significant enough that Arsenal have opted to go back into the transfer market to spend £67million on Eberechi Eze to replace him.",
      "They aren't the only clubs beset with fitness issues, however - while some teams have suspensions to deal with too. Ahead of the second Premier League gameweek, Mirror Sport has taken a look at every team's injury and suspension list.",
      "The Gunners losing Kai Havertz to a knee injury was a major blow for Mikel Arteta and he won't have the German star back any time soon. He is currently being assessed, having only just returned from a hamstring issue.",
      "Arsenal have a few other injury problems to contend with as well, new signing Christian Norgaard remains out for another week or so with a \"little issue\" that kept him out of the 1-0 win at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta also revealed that Ben White is a doubt for this weekend's clash against Leeds United, with the defender facing a fitness test.",
      "The club's only long-term injury is Gabriel Jesus, who is still rehabilitating following his agonising ACL injury that he picked up at the start of the calendar year. He's not expected to be back until late November at the earliest.",
      "Meanwhile, new signing Eze won't feature with his official registration coming after the deadline at 12pm on Friday.",
      "Starting off with suspensions, Villa have one to contend with ahead of their clash against Brentford. Ezri Konsa was sent off in the opening day draw against Newcastle, but luckily for boss Unai Emery he will only be banned for one game - since he was dismissed for denying a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Emiliano Martinez will be available again after serving his own suspension from last season.",
      "Andres Garcia has an undisclosed injury and won't be fit for this weekend's game, while Ross Barkley isn't available either due to a lack of match fitness.",
      "The Cherries are hoping to welcome back Justin Kluivert and Ryan Christie back after both missed the start of the season.",
      "Kluivert has problems in his calf and heel, while Christie has been struggling with a pelvic issue - with the latter making progress by returning to training. Manager Andoni Iraola said this week that he was optimistic Christie could be involved against Wolves.",
      "Lewis Cook has a knee injury and will be a longer absentee. He's not expected to return for Bournemouth until after the first international break next month.",
      "The Bees are aiming to welcome back Mikel Damsgaard this weekend after he missed the season opener after his wife welcomed their newborn baby.",
      "Yoane Wissa is expected to be left out again as speculation continues over his future. Ethan Pinnock is not expected to be fit for the Villa game this weekend after picking up a knock in pre-season but could return before the end of the month.",
      "Gustavo Nunes could be back in September after picking up a hamstring issue earlier this summer, while Vitaly Janelt has a similar timeframe as he recovers from a foot injury.",
      "Jack Hinshelwood could possibly return against Everton this weekend after picking up a knock, but Solly March remains out with a knee injury and is not expected back until next month. Thomas Watson is \"an option\" to play against Everton, manager Fabian Hurzeler said.",
      "Adam Webster is also suffering with a knee problem he sustained in July and could miss a large part of the season after undergoing surgery.",
      "New signing Charalampos Kostoulas is not yet ready for action as he continues to build up his match fitness.",

      "Bashir Humphreys is also back in training after a hamstring issue but the Sunderland game could come too soon for him. Connor Roberts and Jordan Beyer - who both have knee injuries - are expected back after the international break.",
      "Burnley's longer-term injuries are Zian Flemming, who only recently returned to training and lacks match fitness, plus Manuel Benson - who has an achilles injury. Zeki Amdouni is out for a long spell with an ACL blow.",
      "Mykhailo Mudryk remains suspended amid an anti-doping investigation. Romeo Lavia (muscle) could be out until after the international break.",
      "Defender Benoit Badiashile has a similar timeframe as he continues his recovery from a hamstring blow, adding to Enzo Maresca's problems in defence. Earlier this summer the Italian lost Levi Colwill to an ACL injury that will likely rule him out for much of the 2025-26 Premier League season.",
      "Chelsea's only other long-term absentee is midfielder Omari Kellyman, who suffered a re-occurrence of his hamstring injury earlier this year, having already missed most of 2024-25.",
      "Oliver Glasner is not expected to welcome back any of his injured stars for this weekend's clash against Nottingham Forest, though Matheus Franca looks like the closest to returning. He missed most of pre-season with a groin/hip injury but could return before the end of the month.",
      "Longer-term injuries are Eddie Nketiah, who has a hamstring injury and will likely be out until October. Cheick Doucoure and Chadi Dnanou are both still recovering from an ACL injuries and will not be back until November at the earliest.",
      "Nathan Patterson - who has a hip problem - and Vitalii Mykolenko are both unavailable for this weekend's game against Brighton, but David Moyes says they are both not far off returning.",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite is also \"on the way\", according to the Toffees boss, but he won't be fit for the Seagulls as he continues to recover from a hamstring blow.",
      "Marco Silva doesn't have too many injury problems to contend with. Ryan Sessegnon and Antonee Robinson are his only absentees and both players are expected back soon.",
      "Sessegnon could make this weekend's home clash against Manchester United after picking up a knock in pre-season, while Robinson is just weeks away from returning from a knee injury that required surgery last season.",
      "New signing Jaka Bijol is set to be available for selection against Arsenal this weekend after being sent off for Udinese at the end of last season.",
      "Fellow new addition Dominic Calvert-Lewin is also battling to feature after building up his match fitness following his release from Everton. Ethan Ampadu is out until after the international break with a knee injury. Sebastiaan Bornauw does not have a return date after an ankle blow.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch is available again for this weekend's trip to Newcastle after serving his one-match suspension against Bournemouth last week.",
      "Liverpool's only other major injury concern is Frimpong, who will miss the next few weeks after injuring his hamstring in that 4-2 win over the Cherries, which forced him to be substituted.",
      "Conor Bradley, meanwhile, is back in training at the perfect time after missing the Community Shield loss to Palace and the opening day clash against Bournemouth. Slot will hope to have him back in time for Newcastle - but it might come too soon for him.",
      "Joe Gomez is another option in that position, but is also severely lacking match fitness.",
      "Pep Guardiola has confirmed Phil Foden (ankle) and Rodri (groin/hip) are both in ready to face Tottenham this weekend - which will be a huge moment for the latter after missing most of the 2024-25 Premier League season.",
      "Goalkeeper Ederson was suffering with illness and missed the opening game against Wolves, but he will be back and ready for selection vs Spurs.",
      "Savinho faces at least another week on the sidelines with an undisclosed issue, while Josko Gvardiol is also not ready to return to action.",
      "Mateo Kovacic has a longer way to go before returning from his leg injury and could be out until October. Marcus Bettinelli and Kalvin Phillips do not currently have return dates.",
      "It's a simple situation for United boss Ruben Amorim. His only long-term absentee is centre-back Lisandro Martinez, who could be out until the latter end of the year with an ACL injury he picked up in February.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui has not featured yet this season after picking up a hamstring injury and is not likely to be back in time for Fulham, but could return for United's next game against Burnley on August 30.",
      "A big boost is having goalkeeper Andre Onana ready for selection again after missing pre-season and the first game against Arsenal. He should go straight into the starting XI.",
      "Wantaway forward Alexander Isak remains unavailable for Monday night's game against Liverpool - the team that are attempting to snap him up - as he continues to go on strike amid the fallout over his transfer saga.",
      "Eddie Howe doesn't have too many other injury concerns. Joe Willock (leg) didn't play in the opening game against Aston Villa but is working hard to return to fitness and could be back to face the Reds.",
      "Only one injury concern for manager Nuno Espirito Santo. Midfielder Nicolas Dominguez will be out for the next few months with a serious knee injury he picked up in May that required surgery.",
      "Nordi Mukiele, Jenson Seelt (groin/hip) and Arthur Masuaku are back in training and could feature against Burnley, but face late fitness tests.",
      "Luke O'Nien (shoulder), Dennis Cirkin (wrist) and Ajibola Alese (shoulder) are not expected back until after the first international break next month. Romain Mundle (hamstring) and Leo Hjelde (leg) face months more on the sidelines.",
      "Destiny Udogie (knee) is nearing a return to action but the huge trip to Manchester City this weekend comes too soon for him. Manor Solomon (leg) remains out but shouldn't be too far away.",
      "Tottenham's newest issues are with Yves Bissouma and Kota Takai (foot), who have not yet been given return dates by manager Thomas Frank.",
      "Much further away are Dejan Kulusevski (ACL), who will not play again for Tottenham before the end of the year. Radu Dragusin and James Maddison are also recovering from ACL blows, with the former potentially back in December - but the latter could miss most of the season.",
      "George Earthy (foot) is back in training and could be involved in Graham Potter's group to face Chelsea, but Crysensio Summerville is still rehabilitating from a hamstring injury. Luis Guilherme does not have a return schedule.",
      "Wolves boss Vitor Pereira has virtually a clean bill of health. His only absentee is Leon Chiwome, who is recovering from an ACL injury picked up in January and won't be expected back until late October at the earliest.",

      "He made the move to Spain on a season long loan with an option to buy and debuted off the bench as Barcelona began their La Liga campaign with a 3-0 win over Mallorca, who had two players sent off in the first-half.",
      "However, Flick was critical of his side's performance after the game, accusing them of only playing at \"50 per cent\" after Mallorca went down to nine men. \"I didn't like the match,\" he told Movistar.",
      "\"These are three important points, but after going 2-0 up, and with the two red cards, I think my team played at 50 per cent. That can't happen. I need to talk to the players about this. You can't play at 50 per cent against nine players, that's not what I expect.\"",

      "\"I know he's more comfortable playing as a winger, but with his strengths, he contributes a lot to our play. I'm confident we'll see a great Marcus Rashford this season.\"",

      "When Carragher clarified that he sees United finishing either seventh or eighth in the table, Neville slammed his co-pundit and accused him of being untruthful. He said: \"You think they're going to be eighth?",
      "Carragher then replied: \"I think the best they can get is Europa League. They're getting nowhere near Champions League. Sixth, seventh, in the mix for that.\"",
      "Determined to extract a precise number from Carragher rather than a vague prediction, Neville asked again: \"What's your position? You can't just say...\" before Carragher replied: \"Well, what's Europa League? So is Champions League top five? Could be top five, could be top four.",
      "\"Let's say it's top five like last season. I don't see them getting Champions League, so they could be six, seven, eight. One of those positions.\"",
      "Wide-eyed and with his hand on his forehead in visible frustration, Neville then said: \"Oh my God, what position is it?\" for one last time. Thankfully, he managed to get a straight answer out of his fellow pundit that time round, with Carragher responding: \"Seventh. We'll do it in the middle. We'll call them seventh.\"",
      "It comes as the Red Devils endured a disappointing 1-0 loss against Arsenal in their Premier League curtain-raiser at Old Trafford on Sunday, with Riccardo Calafiori connecting with the ball at the far post from a corner to secure victory for the Gunners. However, there are hopes that Ruben Amorim's summer recruitment drive will bear fruit in time.",
      "The Portuguese manager could only achieve a woeful 15th-place finish in the table last campaign with the squad he took over from Erik ten Hag. Following the decision to support Amorim financially and grant him a complete pre-season programme to get ready, the United hierarchy will demand improved displays from the side this time around.",
      "The Red Devils have already splashed out over £200million on talents including Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, But they could still be poised to bring in additional new arrivals before the transfer window shuts on September 1.",

      "The Bundesliga struck a new TV rights deal in the UK this week that will see games broadcast for free on television and YouTube. However, fans will still require a TV licence to watch along on either platform.",
      "However, the decision to partner with leading YouTube channels as part of this free-to-air strategy has made a splash. The Overlap, a channel that typically features Gary Neville, Roy Keane and Ian Wright, will show 20 games for the upcoming Bundesliga season. Mark Goldbridge's That's Football, which is usually divisive and tailored to Manchester United content, will also stream 20 games.",
      "The first game of the new Bundesliga season will kick off at 7:30pm UK time on Friday evening, as Bayern welcome Leipzig to the Allianz Arena.",
      "Vincent Kompany's side have not lost an opening tie in 13 seasons, winning 11 and drawing just two in this timeframe. The Bavarian club regained their league title last year and will be hoping to begin their defence of it positively.",
      "Leipzig, on the other hand, will still be licking their wounds after losing star striker Benjamin Sesko to United, and will be looking to improve on a seventh-placed finish last time out, which meant they will not be contesting any European football this term.",
      "As per the new TV rights deal, the BBC will air Bayern Munich vs RB Leipzig on their BBC Sport website and iPlayer. The game can also be watched on The Overlap and Mark Goldbridge's That's Football YouTube channels, which have 1.5million and 1.4m subscribers respectively, and the Bundesliga's official channel.",
      "However, a TV licence is necessary to watch the match on either platform. Fans will need a licence to watch via the BBC as usual. And although watching pre-recorded videos and other on-demand content on YouTube can be done without a licence, tuning into any live TV broadcast requires one.",
      "This also applies to any live broadcast aired on Netflix, such as large boxing events. A standard colour licence in the UK costs £174.50 per year and can be paid in full or split into weekly or monthly installments.",
      "\"We are delighted to announce our new-look line up of great media partners as part of our multi-platform strategy in the UK and Ireland,\" said chief executive officer of Bundesliga International, Peer Naubert, after the directive was announced on Wednesday.",
      "\"Our approach is as diverse as our supporters: by combining established broadcasters with digital platforms and content creators, we are taking a progressive step in how top-level football can be experienced.",
      "\"This multi-layered strategy allows us to connect with more audiences across the UK and Ireland, giving every supporter the chance to engage with football as it's meant to be in the way that suits them best.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho has yet to finalise his future this summer after being one of five players cast aside by Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim. The ex-England winger, 25, has not played for the club since the Community Shield in 2024 and spent last season on loan at Chelsea.",
      "After a disappointing season at Stamford Bridge where he scored just three Premier League goals in 31 games, the Blues paid a £5m penalty fee to send him back to Manchester despite having the opportunity to sign him permanently for £25m.",
      "Following his return to Carrington, he's trained away from the first-team and was even afforded more time before returning to training by Amorim in order to secure a move away. However, with less than 10 days to go in the window, Sancho remains a contracted Man United player.",
      "Despite time quickly ticking in the window, Sancho's future continues to be shrouded in uncertainty. There have been clubs to register an interest in the forward, namely Roma and Besiktas, as the 25-year-old looks to reignite what once was an extremely promising career.",
      "However, according to reports, a move to the Turkish Super Lig doesn't appeal to Sancho despite it meaning he'd reunite with former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who signed the winger back in 2021.",
      "Reportedly earning £250,000 on the five-year contract he signed upon his Old Trafford arrival, it's been claimed that that the Serie A side are reluctant to match his wages with Sancho himself believed to not be keen on a move to the Italian capital.",
      "While United have massively improved their attacking arsenal this summer with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, midfield remains an issue for Amorim.",
      "It was earlier this month when the Red Devils were said to be interested in Brighton's Carlos Baleba who enjoyed a stellar season with the Seagulls last year. The 21-year-old was said to be interested in a switch to Old Trafford but has reportedly been valued at around £120m by his current club.",
      "According to the Independent, United are attempting to figure out how they'd structure payments of the fee to Brighton, with one possible solution to be offering an £80m fee with the rest of the figure being comprised of add-ons.",
      "Another consideration, albeit unlikely, would have been to send Sancho to the Amex Stadium as part of the transfer but it's not seen as a deal Brighton would be expected to go for.",
      "The Serie A giants are among the handful of teams reportedly interested in acquiring Sancho this month. However, Juventus are said to only consider signing the winger if they're able to move on one of their other forwards.",
      "General manager Damien Comolli - who previously spent two years as Liverpool's sporting director from 2010 to 2012 - revealed the United ace is a target when asked about the prospect of bringing him to Turin.",
      "Per Sport Witness, the Frenchman said: \"I think the club is very attractive; many agents and players are calling me. After all, we are Juventus, and we want to get back to winning ways.",
      "\"Securing Conceicao’s permanence was a clear and strong decision because he can play on both fronts. We have two of the best wingers in the world, and Nico is a great player. If someone were to leave, we will consider him [Sancho].\"",
      "Sancho was assigned the number 25 when making his £72m move to Old Trafford in 2021 and had worn that number up until his loan departure to Chelsea last season.",
      "Thanks to his absence, the number - which the Englishman last wore in what is likely to be his final United appearance in the 2024 Community Shield - was relocated to Manuel Ugarte upon his transfer to United last year.",
      "Not only was Sancho left out of the matchday squad for United's Premier League opener at Arsenal, he's also not been assigned a squad number for the 2025-26 season, an indicator of his probable exit this window.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United could still get their way over Rasmus Hojlund – thanks to an injury of a former player. Hojlund is on the transfer list at United after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko and it appears that a move that suits all parties could be on the horizon.",
      "United spending £74million to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig was always likely to spell the end for Hojlund at Old Trafford after a difficult 2024/25 campaign. The Danish striker managed just 10 goals in 52 matches last season and Ruben Amorim has opted to splash £200m on a whole new front line of Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Hojlund is part of a group of United outcasts that also includes Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia. United are keen to seal a permanent transfer for the 22-year-old, but had until recently only received interest around loans from Italy, where he has a good reputation following a spell with Atalanta.",
      "However, an injury to ex-United striker Romelu Lukaku has shifted the thinking at Napoli, where Antonio Conte is looking for reinforcements up front. The defending Serie A champions are likely to be without Lukaku until November and are warming to the idea of signing Hojlund after the success of Scott McTominay's move.",
      "Reports in Italy state that Hojlund is their priority in the remainder of the summer transfer window and they are willing to change their stance to get him. Napoli had previously been reluctant to go beyond a loan deal with an option to buy, but they are now considering an obligation to buy clause.",
      "That would come as a major boost for United, who are desperate to shift their unwanted players so they can reinvest in a No.6 midfielder. While Marcus Rashford left on loan for Barcelona, they have struggled to shift the other members of Amorim’s so-called ‘bomb squad’.",
      "Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two summers ago, but they are willing to cut their losses. He has previously been valued at around £35m, having scored 26 goals in 95 games for United altogether.",
      "Napoli do have other options, with Roma striker Artem Dovbyk and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson also on their list. AC Milan had been keen on Hojlund but reportedly now prefer Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic, while Lecce's Nikola Krstovic, Monaco's Breel Embolo and Sassuolo's Andrea Pinamonti are also options.",
      "Amorim left Hojlund out of the squad for their opening game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday and the Dane won’t be involved when they play Fulham on Sunday. Joshua Zirkzee was an unused substitute against the Gunners and also faces an uncertain future this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Newcastle striker Alexander Isak faces an awkward return to the squad if a summer transfer to Liverpool doesn't materialise. However, pundits Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney share opposing ideas on whether he can rescue his career in the north-east.",
      "Isak, 25, has angered many around St James' Park after doubling down on his desire to leave Newcastle. The Swede was the subject of an unsuccessful £110million bid from Liverpool earlier this summer but continues to campaign for a move, even though that offer was turned down.",
      "Newcastle's frontman recently released a statement insisting \"promises were broken\" after he was supposedly told he could leave the club this summer. The Magpies have since responded with a statement of their own, denying those claims, putting the two parties at odds in an awkward stand-off entering the final week of the transfer window.",
      "But despite all that, Magpies legend Shearer still believes there's a way for Isak to earn his way back into Newcastle's good books. When asked by Micah Richards whether he saw a realistic route back for Isak at Newcastle, Shearer told his The Rest Is Football colleague: \"Yeah, I think so. Yeah, there is [a way back].",
      "\"I think it would have to be done before the transfer window closes, if that's gonna happen. And it's a big 'if. A huge 'if'. Because otherwise, it's just, 'Aw, I'm stuck here, and I have to play, or I have to do this,' y'know?",
      "\"He's made his feelings known. But yeah, I think there's always a way back. It's happened before. It was [Luka] Modric, wasn't it? One of a few, actually. Modric was at Tottenham [but] wanted to leave for Chelsea, I think? And was made to sit and play that season, and then he went to Real Madrid. And he was brilliant that season. So there is a way back. But I think it has to be done before the window closes.\"",
      "Brentford's Yoane Wissa has been touted as a potential replacement for Isak should he leave. However, if Liverpool don't improve their initial offer, there's currently no obvious destination for the Newcastle talisman.",
      "And it could lead to a very uncomfortable reunion at St James' Park should Isak be forced to stay where he is. Manchester United icon Rooney has made his feelings clear on where he would stand if he were another member of the Newcastle squad.",
      "\"If I'm a Newcastle player, I don't want Isak back,\" he said on his new BBC podcast, The Wayne Rooney Show. \"I think if players leave football clubs - and that happens all the time - there's a way to go about it.",
      "\"You can't go on strike, can't not turn up for training and train with your team-mates. If you want to leave the club or not, you have to be there for your team-mates and be ready if needed.\"",
      "He went on to say: \"For me, I don't think there's any way back for Isak at Newcastle. I think there are cases where it can happen, but from me as a person, I don't think I could accept them back.",
      "\"In terms of Isak's team-mates I wouldn't want him back. You can ask to leave a football club - that happens, or the club tell you you're leaving - but you have to be professional.\"",
      "Much of the football world is in agreement that Isak hasn't been the model professional after backing out of Newcastle's pre-season tour and being banished from training with the squad. And it leaves Eddie Howe with one heck of a repair job should the player be forced to stay put for this season.",

      "United have spent big on attacking reinforcements so far, bringing in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while Brighton star Baleba emerged as Ruben Amorim's top midfield target.",
      "However, the Seagulls want more than £100million for Baleba and United are said to have cooled their interest as a result. That has led to them considering a move for Hjulmand, who Amorim knows well from his time in charge of Sporting.",
      "This is despite his love for Arsenal, with Hjulmand telling Portuguese outlet Record last year: \"My dad supported Arsenal and we watched games together when we were younger.\"",
      "It was Amorim who signed Hjulmand for Sporting back in 2023 and the Denmark international has hailed the impact he had on his career. Speaking after Amorim left Sporting for United, Hjulmand said: \"It was also difficult for me to hear.",
      "\"I was sad that Ruben is leaving me and leaving Sporting. It is a great opportunity. I hope that Ruben is proud of himself for getting an offer like this.",
      "\"Of course, Ruben was one of the reasons why I came to Sporting. When you work with Ruben you see a clear picture. That was important when I joined Sporting – first to understand how he plays.",

      "Brighton value Baleba at more than £100m and it appears as though a deal is unlikely to be struck this summer, with United willing to wait until next year. However, reports have claimed that there is a sell-on clause which means 15 percent of any fee Brighton receive will go to Lille.",
      "And that means Brighton will likely still demand a huge fee for Baleba next summer as a £100m sale would see them lose £15m to Lille. Baleba joined Brighton from the French club back in 2023 for a fee of around £26m.",

      "Instead, Bayindir was named in the starting XI and was at fault for the set-piece goal which cost them a point after an encouraging performance.",
      "The United boss had the perfect opportunity to quash any potential headlines, considering Onana had missed much of the pre-season with injury. But he went out of his way to confirm the Cameroonian was fit to play and simply not selected.",
      "He said: \"We try to choose the best players for each game, so next week is a different life. This week, we chose these players. No (he is not injured), he's recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.\"",

      "Altay Bayindir can't cope with corners, Senne Lammens scores from them.",
      "Manchester United's interest in the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper is accelerating amid the prospect of bringing the Belgian in to challenge Andre Onana for the number one spot.",
      "The spotlight is often thrust on Old Trafford keepers and last week it shone brightly on Bayindir. Ruben Amorim showed faith in the 27-year-old to hand him the gloves against Arsenal but he flapped badly at an early corner and Riccardo Calafiori headed in what proved to be the only goal of the game.",
      "Amorim defender the Turkey international after the match but deep down the boss must know his number two isn't up to task. With uncertainty over Onana's long-term spot as first choice keeper and the dependable if overlooked Tom Heaton approaching 40, there will need to be a reshaping of the goalkeeping department.",
      "Lammens, a 23-year-old who has caught the eye in his homeland, could be the first piece in the jigsaw. Since moving to Antwerp from Club Brugge he has caught the eye, earned international recognition and been linked with a number of top clubs.",
      "United could make a move for the €20million rated keeper and he would bring a calmness and confidence that Onana and Bayndir have failed to offer.",
      "\"As a goalkeeper you have to stay calm to instil confidence in your defenders and the rest of the team,\" Lammens said in a 2024 interview with Het Nieuwsblad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"You're not supposed to be stressed out between the posts. As a youth player, that happened to me sometimes, but in recent years, it hasn't bothered me at all.",
      "\"They always say that I stay level emotionally. That I'm stable and never go up or down too quickly. I'm happy about that, by the way. I think that's a good quality for a goalkeeper.\"",
      "It's a quality United have lacked in recent years. The prospect of a calm keeper providing a foundation at the back and a confidence in his team-mates would offer the Reds a cornerstone on which to build.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson once said a great goalkeeper could be worth 15 points a season. This United are in no position to turn down a chance to improve their tally as they seek to challenge the top six following a dismal 2024-25 campaign.",
      "Lammens is far from the finished article but is a decent distributor - something that United sought out when signing Onana - while the Belgian is a commanding presence in his penalty area and a capable shot stopper.",
      "According to Opta Analyst, Senne Lammens prevented 17.4 goals from being scored in the Belgian Pro League in 2024-25.",
      "And he's ready for the next step. When he left Brugge in 2023 he spoke about being in his comfort zone and needing a change of scenery. He had to wait for his breakthrough at Antwerp but grasped it with both hands and went from strength to strength. Now he's eyeing a top European league.",
      "When asked in late July if he was ready to make a move amid United's interest, he said: \"Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes. But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here [grins]. In any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.",
      "“I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place.",
      "“Ideally, that means playing immediately, but it’s also possible I’ll have to take a step in between. As long as there’s a plan, it doesn’t matter whether I’m ready for the next step or not. Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.”",
      "Lammens next step could be at Old Trafford, it would cap quite the journey for a player who struggled to make the breakthrough at Brugge despite being highly rated coming through the ranks and being named in a Champions League matchday squad at just 16.",
      "He even scored from a corner in a Youth League game against Real Madrid as a teenager in 2019. United will simply settle for him stopping set pieces at the other end.",

      "Luke Shaw made an appearance in each of Manchester United's pre-season games.",
      "Shaw made three starts and came on from the bench twice across the summer schedule, so it was no surprise to see him start against Arsenal, especially with Lisandro Martinez unavailable.",
      "The 30-year-old jumped into a rash challenge early in the first half but recovered well. Shaw delivered a strong performance, keeping Bukayo Saka quiet, and reminded fans of what he can do when fit.",
      "The truth is that nobody has ever doubted Shaw's quality. He was even the best left-back in the world in 2020/21 (that sounds absurd, but look back at the other left-backs from that season and you'll agree).",
      "The only problem with Shaw is his United career has been plagued by injuries, some of which are due to his lack of robustness, some of which have been the club's fault, and others that have just been unfortunate.",
      "Shaw suffered a double leg fracture in 2015 and his muscle injuries were mishandled in 2023/2024, with United expecting him to play two games in the space of a few days after returning.",
      "Referring to that season, Shaw said: “I felt something against Aston Villa and came off at half-time. It’s kind of ­everyone’s fault. Partly my fault, partly medical staff, I think everyone would admit that.",
      "\"I didn’t train the whole week. The scan came back and there wasn’t too much there. But I didn’t train all week, then trained the day before the game. If the manager asks me to play, I’m never going to say no. I shouldn’t have played.”",
      "You don't need a degree in medical science to work out Shaw shouldn't have been playing two games in the space of four days, immediately after recovering from a muscle issue.",
      "Having said that, Shaw is not a robust athlete and can be fairly scrutinised for missing so much time on the pitch. The positive news is United are competing in just the Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup this season, which means Shaw should be able to cope with the fixture load.",
      "United's defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final meant there would be no European football at Old Trafford, and that is good news for Shaw's chances of maintaining fitness.",
      "If Shaw is available, it seems he will be a regular starter on the left of the back-three. Martinez is due to return from a knee injury, but he might find it hard to wrestle back the starting role from Shaw.",
      "Amorim rates Shaw highly and he discussed the left-back and Mason Mount at his press conference on Friday. \"More important [than England] is for them to help Manchester United to reach our goals,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Then they are very, very good players, they are experienced and have played a lot of matches. Mason Mount won the Champions League, and Luke Shaw, I've already said, when he's fit, is really a special player and you can see it every time he plays. So it's really important for us to have these two guys available for more games.\"",
      "Shaw will compete with Martinez and Ayden Heaven for the left side role in the back-three, but he has the advantage of starting the new campaign in that position, so something must give for him to lose it.",
      "That could be Shaw picking up an injury and performing poorly. However, on the evidence shown against Arsenal, Shaw will be confident of retaining his role, providing he's able to stay fit.",
      "It was interesting to hear Amorim describe Shaw as a \"special\" player. That was high praise from United's head coach, but Shaw's quality has been rarely seen over the last few seasons.",
      "Shaw needs to remind everyone why he is a special talent consistently each week.",

      "Ruben Amorim may have defended him publicly but surely Altay Bayindir's latest howler against Arsenal last weekend sealed his Manchester United fate.",
      "Amorim weakly flapped at Declan Rice's corner which allowed Riccardo Calafiori the simplest of headers to secure the Gunners a vital three points away from home.",
      "For United it was an all too familiar tale: a goalkeeper costing them matches. Bayindir made a similar error in the Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat to Tottenham last season.",
      "When that point was raised at Amorim's post match press conference and the suggestion was made that third choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton should have been considered ahead of Bayindir, the United boss jumped to his goalkeeper's defence.",
      "\"Why? Without VAR [in the competition],” the 40-year-old said. \"With VAR, it’s a foul. And then what happened in the next game? Arsenal. Who saved the penalty? Who saved the game?\"",
      "Bayindir's heroics that day did secure United's passage into the FA Cup fourth round but that performance was very much the exception to the rule during his time at the club thus far.",
      "Andre Onana is expected to regain his place between the sticks against Fulham this weekend, despite doubts over his performances across the last two seasons.",
      "Given the number of high profile errors Onana himself has made, one would suggest a good enough number two may well have usurped him as United's number one by now.",
      "Put simply, Bayindir isn't good enough for United and the timing of fresh links to Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens are certainly curious.",
      "The 23-year-old has continued to impress for Royal Antwerp this season and has been described as an ideal fit for the Premier League.",
      "United have not entirely ruled out signing a new goalkeeper but are not planning for a headline number one to come in before the transfer deadline.",
      "Lammens fits that bill. He won't command a huge fee while United prioritise a move for a new midfielder, but he will be an upgrade on Bayindir with the potential to grow into a legitimate challenger for Onana's starting berth.",
      "With competition growing in the market for Lammens, who has been involved in the last two Belgium squads, United may have to make a decision over whether they make a move between now and the end of the window.",
      "On the evidence of last weekend's defeat to Arsenal, that decision should be obvious.",

      "Chelsea are the frontrunners to sign Garnacho, Sancho has held discussions with Italian clubs, Real Betis are still interested in re-signing Antony while Malacia is available for around £4million.",
      "Amorim said during United's pre-season tour he would \"receive\" any of the players if they failed to move elsewhere, however that was viewed as a challenge to them to clinch transfers away from United ahead of the World Cup next year. The United head coach stressed the club had attempted to \"arrange everything\" for the players to leave.",
      "\"I think again, I know that is not a good thing to have players in this situation,\" Amorim admitted, \"but it’s clear they want to play in a different club and that is clear.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is giving serious consideration to recalling goalkeeper Andre Onana against Fulham.",

      "The United striker is available for a loan but a move to the Bundesliga giants has reservation within the club's management. However, exits and failure to secure key targets mean Vincent Kompany is somewhat short.",

      "Napoli are the latest team to be linked with an interest, with the striker left out of the squad for the Premier League opener against Arsenal last weekend.",
      "“He has to go,” Laudrup said on Viaplay, as quoted by Tipsbladet.",
      "“I don’t see that he has any future at the club at all. If you start playing with mostly midfielders as a 9 and you’re left out, that tells me that he won’t get any chances.",
      "“He has played the aces he had up his sleeve, and there weren’t many of them last season, in a very, very difficult season, so he should go to a new place now, where he’s loved and gets to play.",
      "“The only thing I don’t like is a loan agreement. I have to be honest. I’ve tried it myself, and it’s not fun, because you always fall down the pecking order when you’re rented, even if there’s someone who’s been bought for many millions.",
      "“But it may be that the best he can get is a loan agreement, because there aren’t many clubs in Italy that can afford to buy him, that’s the challenge.”",

      "\"Fulham were fortunate to get something against Brighton but I think they'll improve in front of their own fans.",
      "\"Fulham don't play with any fear and will take the game to Manchester United which gives me a sneaking feeling United will exploit them and win this one.",

      "One of the reasons United may have walked away from a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been revealed.",
      "United showed an interest in the player this summer, but Brighton's stance means the club have moved onto other targets.",
      "One of the reasons for such a strong stance from the Seagulls could be a clause in the player's contract.",
      "It is reported that Lille have a 15% sell-on clause for Baleba, meaning it will reduce any money made by Brighton if or when they sell him on, causing them to up any potential asking price.",
      "Manchester United have no concrete plans to make a move for Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller this summer, according to Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg.",
      "United have been linked with an interest in the 24-year-old as one of the potential midfield options before the end of the deadline.",

      "Further updates have emerged about Rasmus Hojlund's future amid rumours of a potential exit from Manchester United.",
      "Hojlund's future has been the subject of intense speculation all summer as the United striker looks increasingly likely to leave the club. The Denmark international has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford after the club signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a £74million deal, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also arriving this summer.",
      "As a result, United have been open to letting Hojlund leave the club this summer on a permanent deal. The Reds are believed to be seeking around £30million for the striker's signature, and a return to Italy is seemingly on the cards.",

After the arrival of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, there is room for United to offload players.",

      "When the Manchester United teamsheet dropped at 3.15pm on Sunday, a fair few jaws dropped with it.",
      "The decision not to start with an out-and-out striker, with Mason Mount asked to provide a focal point for United's new-look attack, instantly looked dubious. But with Benjamin Sesko still settling in and Ruben Amorim experimenting with a false nine in pre-season, it wasn't really a shock.",
      "Amorim had refused to confirm whether Andre Onana would return in goal at his pre-match press conference just two days earlier, and so Altay's Bayindir's inclusion wasn't necessarily a shock either, as costly as that call proved to be.",
      "The third contentious call was in midfield, but with Casemiro having started United's biggest game in decades just months earlier and Manuel Ugarte failing to impress on a consistent basis in pre-season, a lot of fans saw it coming.",
      "All three decisions set alarm bells ringing, but with added context they at least looked understandable.",
      "The same cannot be said for Amorim's selection at right wing-back.",
      "As one of only two players to start all five of United's pre-season friendlies, Amad's place in the starting XI against Arsenal was one of the few you could confidently say was nailed on before the team news arrived.",
      "In a season so bereft of bright spots, Amad's emergence was one of the few positives to take from a truly dismal campaign. Having been overlooked for so long, and given the dark clouds hanging over the club for the majority of last season, his drive and ability to give fans something to cling onto last season truly were a testament to his character as much as his quality.",
      "Having carried United for so long last season alongside Bruno Fernandes, new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were meant to provide support for Amad when it came to carrying the attacking burden. Yet instead their inclusion in the starting XI meant Amorim felt he wasn't so dependent on Amad's attacking flair and he opted for the more defensive-minded Diogo Dalot instead.",
      "Dalot didn't do much wrong against Arsenal and he got into some good attacking positions, but he's never going to get fans on their feet like Amad, and the Ivory Coast international injected more energy into the attacks when he was introduced just before the hour mark.",
      "With no European football at Old Trafford this season, United's campaign could be limited to just 40 games, and will definitely be no longer than 51 games. The reduced workload means Amorim can afford to pick his best players week in, week out, in the Premier League at the very least.",
      "Amad absolutely is one of United's best players and shouldn't begin another league game from the bench.",

      "The ‘drag-along clause’ means the Glazer family have the right to sell to a third party, and to force Ratcliffe to sell his shares; however, Ratcliffe has the right to match any such offer.",

      "Manchester United have been active in the transfer market this summer and Ruben Amorim's vision for the club is finally starting to take shape after a difficult start to life at Old Trafford.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko have all arrived as first-team players at United from Wolves, Brentford and RB Leipzig respectively. Diego Leon has also came into Amorim's squad after his move from Paraguay was finalised.",
      "However, after their worst season in 51 years, the Reds still could do with further recruits. Reports this week have indicated that a new goalkeeper could come in with Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens the subject of advanced interest.",
      "With United's forward line significantly bolstered, United are in a better position to seek success this season. However, some positions remain untouched and prove to be a problem.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport takes a look at how an alternative transfer window may have transpired for United had things gone differently...",
      "As mentioned above, United have been busy this summer and their attack shows that. However, it is only their attack that is proof of their activity and other positions remain lacking quality.",
      "So many players have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, enough to make a brand new team. Let's start with the forward line and in an alternative word, United would be lining-up differently.",
      "Before Sesko arrived, the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen, Liam Delap and Dusan Vlahovic were all linked. Different people had their preference but Osimhen, from the outside, looked the perfect fit.",
      "A consistent finisher who had constantly admitted his ambition to play in the Premier League, Osimhen would have been the powerful, efficient striker United had been lacking last season.",
      "Behind him, is Mbeumo and Cunha. They are both exactly what United need. But in midfield, an alternative transfer window would have seen Ederson come in to be the dream partner to Bruno Fernandes.",
      "United are yet to add a new face in the middle of the park but the Atalanta star’s arrival would ease the concerns over Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte that have emerged from the opening game of the season.",
      "The final signing would be in goal, a position they are currently considering with Lammens. However, their failed attempt to lure Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa earlier in the window is a deal that made perfect sense.",
      "With Osimhen eventually signing for Galatasaray in a £64.8m deal, reports suggesting Martinez was available for £40m and Ederson reportedly available for £51.6m - it would have required a £156.4m outlay to sign those three players.",
      "That would likely have needed United to make significant sales, but several players have been available all summer...",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Where do we begin with this? United have loaned Marcus Rashford out and lost Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof. Away from that, there has been no movement.",
      "The 'bomb squad' of Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all still at the club despite being available for transfer since the start of the window. Ideally, all four would have left at the start to help fund incomings. There are also the ongoing question marks over Rasmus Hojlund and Casemiro.",
      "Exits for both would have handed Amorim more funds to spend elsewhere on other recruits. There's also the mention that had Martinez arrived to become United's new number one, Andre Onana would have likely have been sold - but the club will continue with the Cameroonian as their first-choice goalkeeper this season.",

      "Does anyone remember Tyrell Malacia? He's still on the books at Manchester United.",
      "Malacia was placed into the 'bomb squad' in July, alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, but it felt slightly harsh to categorise Malacia in that group.",
      "The Dutchman has not worked his ticket like Rashford, Garnacho and Sancho. Malacia is simply not good enough for United. Ruben Amorim looked at Malacia after his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in November and quickly decided he should look for a new club in the January transfer window.",
      "Malacia was shipped out to PSV Eindhoven on loan and he made just six starts in all competitions during that stint, which confirmed ahead of the official decision that PSV would not be signing him permanently.",
      "PSV won the Eredivisie last season, so perhaps it was unrealistic for Malacia to break into their side after joining in the middle of the campaign, but Malacia's performances since his return from a serious knee injury last season suggest he might need to lower his sights for his next move.",
      "Interest has been thin on the ground in Malacia since his delayed return to Carrington. The left-back has been training on his own and his agent is working to arrange an exit before the transfer deadline.",
      "Malacia's dream of succeeding at Old Trafford is over and he must be given a degree of sympathy because a knee injury curtailed his time in Manchester. Would Malacia have been a success at United without that injury? Maybe not, but it was a challenging period and he's probably just happy to be playing again.",
      "The 26-year-old initially played through the injury at the end of the 2022/2023 season. Injections were used to get through games. Malacia then underwent surgery but required further surgery after a botched first attempt.",
      "After 517 days on the sidelines, Malacia made his return for the Under-21s against Huddersfield in November, and an interview about his recovery was published on the following day.",
      "\"We spoke to the guy who did my [first knee] surgery and then we made the decision: we had to do something else. I had to start my rehab over, basically… I had one day to be disappointed,\" Malacia told The Athletic.",
      "\"Then I had to be like, ‘OK, we go again’. I think at the end of the day, everything I did, even if it was a mistake or something, I won’t even see it as a mistake because it’s a lesson.",
      "\"I think everything in life is already written for me. I had to go through this whole process to be where I’m at now, so I wouldn’t do anything different.",
      "“You can ask the guys at the club — every time I came in, even though I was feeling s***, sometimes they were like, ‘Oh, your energy is so good, you give me energy again… how is he still smiling, or how is he still working after this and this happened to him?’.",
      "“Of course, I’ve had some moments where I was like, ‘Oh, I’m getting tired of this’ but there’s no way I could ever give up. It’s not my system, it’s not in our family.\"",
      "Malacia was on a long road to recovery, but when he returned, he was not provided with respite because he faced an even bigger challenge: fighting for his future at Old Trafford.",
      "The defender was recently spotted training with a private coach at non-league club Trafford FC. He has trained alone at Carrington over the last month and was recently pictured leaving the training ground with Sancho.",
      "Malacia's time at the club hasn't worked out as hoped and all parties are hoping the chapter is closed this summer. United want to arrange a permanent departure and Malacia will be hoping for the same.",

      "But the imminent return to fitness of Lisandro Martinez and the return to the XI of Luke Shaw mean United have plenty of options in defence when everyone is available.",
      "Fredricson was on the bench for the season opener against Arsenal alongside fellow defenders Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven, who are both ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Once Martinez is fit, minutes could be hard to come by at senior level for Fredricson and a loan could be explored, but given the injury issues that blighted United last term and the need to carry at least five centre back options to cover the back three formation, the chances are the 20-year-old remains at Old Trafford.",

      "Rio Ferdinand's brutal shakedown of Gianluigi Donnarumma has resurfaced following the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper's links to Manchester United this summer.",
      "The Red Devils are interested in signing the shotstopper after a treble-winning season with PSG wasn't enough for boss Luis Enrique to keep him in the squad. Reports suggest that while Manchester City have agreed personal terms with the Italy international, United could still be in with a chance to secure his services.",
      "While the Italian is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the game, Ferdinand has been openly critical of the United target in the past.",
      "During the 2023/24 Champions League quarter-finals, Barcelona took a 3-2 lead over PSG back to the Camp Nou, with two of the three goals coming from Donnarumma blunders. The goalkeeper failed to claim a ball launched into his box, which allowed Raphinha to break the deadlock.",
      "He said at the time: \"Highlight the goalkeeper here. In the first half, the goalkeeper makes two mistakes from crosses. I think in his head he's said, 'I'm going to stay on my line no matter what now', and let the responsibility then fall on the defenders to defending this set piece.",
      "\"That's in his six-yard box. He's 6'7\" or so. That's a crime almost, not coming in your six-yard box and claiming that. It wasn't a ball that was too high. It was there to be attacked, but the impact of the first half mistakes lead to that. That's a player at the top of his game that is having to adjust his approach to a certain set piece because of performance.\"",
      "However, Ferdinand's criticism appears to be a one-off as he's also praised Donnarumma in the past. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the ex-United defender hailed the keeper as one of the best in Europe, and claimed the only reason PSG want rid is due to the evolving nature of goalkeeping in the sport.",
      "\"Did you see the stuff about Donnarumma?\" asked Ferdinand. \"Wow. One of arguably the best goalkeepers in Europe last year, wins a treble. What I'll do is I'll give you the quote from Enrique, which was brutal right? But I kind of like that. You know where you stand but I don't think Donnarumma would've loved it. But let's do these quotes anyway.",
      "\"'Donnarumma is out of the squad as it's my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible.' He said, 'I want a different type of goalkeeper and I made this decision. Wow. Donnarumma is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world. Just that little caveat to cap it off.'",
      "\"One of the best keepers, but just not my type. Now, we would have never seen this 10 years ago. If you are the best goalkeeper in the world, the top club who's winning everything at the time never sells you because you're the best goalkeeper in the world.",
      "\"He might be the best goalkeeper in the world in terms of saving the ball and stuff to stop the ball going into the net, but is he good enough with his feet?",
      "\"I think that is the question, and this is just the ever-evolving kind of identity of a goalkeeper now is very different. I played with so many goalkeepers that could barely reach the halfway line. Couldn't pick anyone out really on a consistent basis.",
      "\"Some could kick it far, but couldn't really have the direction to pick people out. Nowadays, you've got to have like pinpoint accuracy, short and long, over varying distances to be able to understand how to play through the press. If it's two people, three people, or one player pressing, like what's going on behind that press?\"",
      "Ferdinand added: \"The goalkeepers now have got to see so much, they're part of the 11 now. It used to be 10 players and the keeper; it's very different now. So Donnarumma is living in a different world of goalkeepers, and I bet people like Buffon, Edwin Van der Sar, Schmeichel, the top goalkeepers of yesteryear are sitting there going, 'Wow, not in my day, that would have never have happened.'\"",

      "Michael Owen believes Manchester United should be doing everything possible to secure Gianluigi Donnarumma's signature.",
      "The Italian shot-stopper has excelled in his four-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain, though it seems his time in the French capital is nearing its end. Donnarumma has reached the final 12 months of his deal at the Parc des Princes and is searching for fresh opportunities after Les Parisiens brought in Lucas Chevalier as a replacement.",
      "Ruben Amorim has enjoyed a predominantly positive first summer in the transfer market with the Red Devils, securing talents like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, Owen thinks he ought to be considering bolstering the club's choices between the sticks, particularly given that Donnarumma is looking for a move.",
      "Speaking to the Mirror via 247Bet, Owen said: \"Well, when it all came out about Donnarumma leaving Paris Saint-Germain, I thought, 'Oh my word, whoever gets him are going to be a lucky team.",
      "\"I mean, he is unbelievable. He's literally one of, if not the best goalkeeper in the world. I mean, he would be the obvious one, but whether they can get him or not is another matter.\"",
      "United had to call on Altay Bayindir against Arsenal due to Andre Onana's recovery from injury and lack of match fitness. However, many supporters may feel that the club needs to find a permanent replacement for Onana if they are to improve on last season's disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "The Cameroonian has not justified his £47.2million transfer fee since joining Old Trafford from Inter Milan two years ago, and has been criticised for making several high-profile errors. While Donnarumma is a feasible option at the moment, given that PSG are reportedly only asking for £40m for the 26-year-old, United will face tough competition to secure a deal.",
      "Manchester City are currently at risk of losing Ederson to Galatasaray, and despite acquiring James Trafford in a £27m move earlier this summer, the youngster may need more time to develop before he can be a reliable starter. As a result, the Cityzens are rumoured to be interested in bringing Donnarumma to the Etihad Stadium before the transfer deadline, and talks are said to have begun with the European champions.",
      "However, a reluctance to meet PSG's asking price could leave the door open for their neighbours to swoop in for the keeper. With four Ligue 1 titles, five domestic trophies and a Champions League triumph to his name in the French capital, Donnarumma would likely slot directly into the starting XI under Pep Guardiola or Amorim.",
      "He also let in just 25 goals in the league last season and registered five clean sheets. Owen has also pointed out other departments where United would be sensible to concentrate on enhancing should they hope to climb back to the top of the Premier League.",
      "He added: \"Well, I mean, there are areas where they could strengthen. If they want to go and be a top team again and challenge for the league, then there's loads of areas.",
      "\"But just to get back into that sort of European places, then they've probably got a strong enough squad. The goalkeeper looks quite an obvious one that they might need to change at some point.",
      "\"They've not done much surgery to their team apart from right up at the top of the field. So, you know, they've got one or two ageing players in midfield that are going to need changing in time.",
      "\"They've got a lot of defenders at the moment, whether they've got many great ones is a question mark. But I think over time they're going to need to change a fair few players, but just to get them back up in fifth, sixth place type of thing this season, I think they've got more than enough to do that.\"",

      "Manchester United youngster Kobbie Mainoo was an unused substitute against Arsenal last weekend.",
      "There have been concerns about where Mainoo fits into Ruben Amorim's plans, but we're just one game into the new Premier League campaign and it's certainly not time to panic.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro started in the pivot against Arsenal. Manuel Ugarte was introduced for Casemiro in the 65th minute of the contest and Mainoo was left on the bench, clearly for tactical reasons.",
      "Ugarte has a different profile and Amorim decided his qualities were best suited to replace Casemiro. Mainoo started two games in pre-season and they were both alongside Ugarte in the pivot.",
      "Fernandes made a few appearances in the No.10 role in pre-season, which allowed Mainoo a chance to start in the deeper role, but it seems like the pair are competing for the same role in the pivot.",
      "It seems Amorim views Ugarte and Casemiro as competitors for one of the deeper midfield positions, and views Fernandes and Mainoo as competitors for the partnership's other side.",
      "Amorim has tinkered with Mainoo's position since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November, which hasn't been particularly helpful, but it appears he has decided on which role is best for him.",
      "\"I think he [Mainoo] can play in both positions in the midfield. Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball,\" explained Amorim in the USA.",
      "\"I think he is a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. I think he needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I'm always on top of that with Kobbie, because he is so good sometimes but he can be better. So I have big plans. But again, like I said, one game per week, the competition is going to be huge.\"",
      "Amorim also said Fernandes' best position in his system is 'closest to the ball' and he started him in the deeper role against Arsenal, so it's fair to conclude that's where he sees Mainoo's future.",
      "There were valid concerns about Amorim's handling of Mainoo last season, with the signs suggesting his future might be elsewhere, but there was a change of tone when Amorim spoke about him this summer.",
      "Amorim was notably positive and seemed enthusiastic about working with Mainoo, however, he tempered expectations last season and said he still has a long way to go in his development.",
      "At 20 years old, Mainoo is obviously far from the finished article, but he is a supremely talented young player, and it would be a travesty if Amorim couldn't make it work this term.",
      "Not coming on from the bench against Arsenal is not a big deal and Amorim should be given a few months to work with Mainoo before any concrete judgments are made on his future.",
      "If Mainoo is a peripheral squad member by November, then alarm bells will be set ringing. United are competing in the Premier League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup this season, which means fewer opportunities, but Mainoo has enough talent to merit regular starts in Amorim's team.",
      "There is huge interest in Mainoo, given he is an academy graduate and was so brilliant in 2023/2024, but supporters will have to wait and see how the situation unfolds before rushing to panic stations.",
      "Remember Mainoo's performance at Goodison Park on his Premier League debut? Remember his matchwinner against Manchester City in the FA Cup final? Amorim must make it work with the Stockport-born lad.",

      "Manchester United’s deal for Senne Lammens is “almost done” as the imminent arrival of the Royal Antwerp star has led intermediaries to “actively work hard” to find a solution for the man he’s replacing at Old Trafford.",

      "MAILBOX: Man Utd ‘front-foot ballsy football’ could win them title no. 21",
      "He wrote on X: ‘More on Senne Lammens and Man United story revealed today. Talks are well underway with Royal Antwerp on transfer fee close to €20m, negotiations advancing. Lammens said yes to Man United, no talks with Man City as their target is Gigio Donnarumma… if Éderson leaves.’",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and after just one solitary game, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",
      "",
      "8=) Chris Wood (2)\nThe Nottingham Forest striker smashed in two goals v Brentford in his opening game of the season; it’s interesting that the bookies give him more chance of keeping up that form than Richarlison. And based on last season, fair enough, too.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "6) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came via Brighton.",
      "",
      "5) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (0)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd.",
      "",
      "2) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both."

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "14=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "10=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "9) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "3) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "",
      "1=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (albeit since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which still feels entirely possible because surely not everyone is as bad as Brentford – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner."

      "The United boss is understood to be happy with his current options of Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton, but with Lammens close to agreeing personal terms, Amorim was asked whether incomings would be dependent on outgoings.",
      "“It’s not an idea that these guys are going to leave, to play in a different club, and then we’ll receive another player,” Amorim said. “We don’t know what is going to happen, but we’re not waiting to take out someone to get another.”",
      "His comments underline a professional, cards-close-to-chest stance. United’s move for Lammens is progressing regardless, with Fabrizio Romano reporting personal terms are close to being finalised while the clubs discuss a fee.",
      "Antwerp are expected to demand around £17m for the 23-year-old, who has been on United’s radar since December.",
      "United’s goalkeeping issues resurfaced last weekend with Onana absent through injury and Bayindir at fault for Arsenal’s early winner in a 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford. Heaton, now 39, remains the third option.",

      "While Amorim avoided giving a direct answer on reinforcements, he was more forthright on the United bomb squad. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia continue to train separately from the main squad and were once again challenged to sort their futures.",
      "“I think again, I know that is not a good thing to have players in this situation, but it’s clear they want to play in a different club, and that is clear,” Amorim said. “So we try to arrange everything for both parts to be happy, so I have to try to imagine to have the training with the guys that I think are going to be the future and the other guys are training and preparing for the next chapter.",
      "“When the window is closed, it’s a different history. When the window is closed, we have to receive the players and in a new life, anything can happen.”",
      "The Portuguese coach also offered a brief team news update ahead of the weekend. “Onana is ready to play like last week, so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper. Licha is out, Nous is out. The rest of the guys are fit.”",
      "With the transfer deadline looming, United’s rebuild shows no sign of slowing. Amorim might not be saying it directly, but the arrival of a fifth summer signing appears to be edging closer.",
      "Man Utd are ‘actively work hard’ to find a new club for their goalkeeper with their fifth summer signing ‘almost done’.",
      "A Man Utd star has been ‘offered’ to Bayern Munich as Romano reveals a top Red Devils target has ‘said yes’ to the move to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United are ‘accelerating’ to secure a £35m midfielder after Ruben Amorim ‘failed to convince’ the Red Devils board to sign an Aston Villa star.",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim “could not convince” Manchester United to “spend on a good goalkeeper” after the head coach requested a preferred target.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Andre Onana’s “feeling” on being left out of Manchester United’s squad to face Arsenal on Sunday afternoon."

There is nothing shocking, it happens in every locker room, it has already happened and it will happen again. The punishment is totally disproportionate. Everyone knows it, they are lying.”",

I want to tell them to show us the footage… I still wonder how we can treat Adrien like this when we know all the sacrifices he made to come to OM. To mistreat him like this after everything he did last season is unbearable. That’s what’s most shocking.",

      "“When Greenwood signed after hitting his wife, De Zerbi said we could give him a second chance. I agree with giving people second chances, but is it only my son who doesn’t get a second chance? I assume he doesn’t owe OM anything because he paid in advance. It’s OM who should thank him and not disrespect him.”",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Tottenham\nOn Thursday, The Sun suggested that Arsenal were keen on Rogers, but Tottenham’s interest has obviously intensified since they lost out in the race for Eberechi Eze. We can’t see either club getting Rogers out of Villa before the deadline without doing something mental. Rule nothing out with Spurs, but it’s certainly a harder deal to do than the ones they have already failed to pull off.",

      "",
      "19) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Tottenham\nReports in Spain suggest Spurs have agreed a deal. Colour us sceptical. Very. F***ing. Sceptical. Rodrygo’s representatives are clearly trying to create a buzz around the Brazil star, with Liverpool, City and Spurs all said to be interested. The Liverpool links don’t pass the sniff test. Spurs are bound to do something big and probably daft before the deadline, but more likely is that they go for Savinho. Which could free up space for Rodrygo at City…",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nBack on the agenda after the winger remained an unused substitute in Real’s La Liga opener. City are keen, but only if Tottenham take Savinho. Which few at the Etihad were convinced is a wise idea, but Spurs might not come a little more forcibly once they have wiped the Eze custard from their chops. So to speak.",
      "",
      "16) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nJackson has been available all summer but £80million was said to be the price, which is obviously mental for a one-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly want rid of. It does, though, make £60million sound more palatable but even that is too much for any club that hasn’t lost their mind. Desperation, though, can make you do funny things and Newcastle are said to have been in touch with Chelsea in recent days. Bayern Munich too, and Villa continue to be linked, but Newcastle feel the most likely club to offer anything more than a loan-to-buy deal.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which might have scuppered whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane, but that hasn’t stopped them from talking it over with United on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million. Maybe the performance at Leeds will persuade Everton to pay up.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Angelo Stiller – Stuttgart to Manchester United\nYouTube searches for Stiller have presumably increased exponentially after it emerged on Thursday that the midfielder is on United’s list of Baleba alternatives. Of course, the Germany international would be cheaper and a more simple deal to pull off but United’s interest has not yet led to a conversation with Stuttgart so links are tentative. For now.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "9) 🔽 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race but some reports suggest PSG are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay, especially since they have already signed a very good goalkeeper. If only there was another club in Manchester who desperately need a competent goalkeeper…",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "",
      "8) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get id. RB Leipzig’s renewed interest could give Bayern the shove they need.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million but at least they seem to have warmed to the idea of taking back Nkunku. Which would free up some of the funds to sign Simons.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Bilal El Khannouss – Leicester to Crystal Palace\nThe Foxes playmaker is being linked with Spurs, Newcastle, Leeds, and probably a few other Premier League clubs but Palace appear better placed while they look for a replacement for Eze with £60million burning a hole in their pocket. The Eagles will have to spend half of that on either El Khannouss, or…",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him. We anticipate another less mischief-making offer after Monday night’s clash between the two sides at St James’ Park and the nagging feeling remains this will get done.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nWoah! Eze to Arsenal had been shunted from the top 20, with the Tottenham rumour placing as high as no.3 on Wednesday. However, Tottenham missed their window, opened for them by Arsenal’s original faffing. It seems that just as Spurs were about to do the deal, back came Arsenal, prompted by Kai Havertz’s injury and since the feeling always was that Eze would prefer the Gunners, to the Emirates he will go for a package worth £60million in front and around £7.5million in add-ons. Eze’s medical is booked for Friday after he says his goodbyes to Palace on Thursday night from the safety of the sidelines.",

      "Should Liverpool really be spending all that money on Alexander Isak? Do they need him? Does he break their transfer policy?",

      "“One of the midfielders on Manchester United’s list of options is Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller,” Jacobs said.",

      "“Stiller has come up in discussions as #MUFC now decide whether to sign another midfielder before the window shuts.”",
      "Stiller, 24, came through Bayern Munich’s academy before moving to Hoffenheim and later Stuttgart, where he has flourished over the last two seasons.",
      "His rise in value has been rapid, climbing from €5million to around €45m, and he made his Germany debut in 2024.",
      "His reputation as a deep-lying playmaker has been highlighted by Statman Dave on X, who described him as a “world-class distributor” after he ranked among Europe’s elite midfielders for progressive passes last season, averaging 9.49 per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga.",
      "Real Madrid were reportedly tipped off about Stiller by Toni Kroos earlier this year, though they never moved for him, while Liverpool and Arsenal have also tracked his progress.",
      "United’s interest fits with their recent Bundesliga focus under Christopher Vivell, with targets emerging from Germany throughout the summer.",
      "For now, no formal talks have taken place with Stuttgart or the player’s camp, but the discussions inside United point to Stiller being seriously considered as the club weighs up a late midfield move.",
      "United have ten days left to close out their window, and Amorim has been clear about the need for another addition in the middle of the park."

      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",

      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "",
      "19) Christian Karambeu (Middlesbrough, £2.1m)\nWe’re in absolute agreement with Karambeu, who insisted his move to Teeside from Madrid was a “big, big deal” on the back of two Champions League titles in three years for Los Blancos, to go with his World Cup and European Championship winners medals with France. Boro finished 14th in his only season before Karambeu upped sticks to Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "18) Davor Suker (Arsenal, £3.5m)\nBought as a replacement for Nicolas Anelka, who moved in the opposite direction for £22.3m, it’s fair to say Croatia’s World Cup 1998 hero wasn’t quite like-for-like, scoring just 11 goals in 39 appearances. Fortunately Arsenal also signed a certain Thierry Henry in the same summer.",
      "",
      "17) Fernando Morientes (Liverpool, £6.3m)\nHe managed just 12 goals in 61 appearances and later admitted he was the “worst version of myself” during a two-year stint as Anfield which was “killing me slowly”. Yikes.",
      "",
      "16) Jonathan Woodgate (Middlesbrough, £7m)\nAfter two injury-ravaged seasons at the Bernabeu, Woodgate returned to fitness and form at Boro before moving to Spurs in January in 2008 and immediately becoming the second-last (yes, the second last) trophy-winning hero.",
      "",
      "15) Njitap Geremi (Chelsea, £6.9m)\nArriving in the first cash-laden summer of the Romano Abramovich era, his always felt like a slightly odd signing after a decent but not world-beating season on loan from Madrid at Middlesbrough. After 19 starts in his debut season under Claudio Ranieri, Geremi was never more than a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, though we’re sure he’s perfectly happy with a haul of two Premier Leagues, two League Cups and an FA Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham, £8m)\nWe’re not sure whether Tottenham fans will be delighted or sickened by Van der Vaart claiming the Harry Redknapp side he played in with Gareth Bale and Luka Modric was “the best team I ever played in” having left Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema, Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy behind him at Real Madrid.",
      "That may well have been the peak ‘Spurs are fun but are never going to win anything’ period and Van der Vaart was a big reason for that, presumably swapping notes with Jamie O’Hara over their future roles as Tell It Like It Is pundits, colloquially known as ‘pr*cks’.",
      "",
      "13) Esteban Granero (QPR, £9m)\nHe joined as one of several ‘marquee signings’ among 15 in total in that mad 2012 summer which was entirely predictably QPR’s undoing as they finished bottom of the table.",
      "",
      "12) Claude Makelele (Chelsea, £16.8m)\nComfortably the best Premier League signing from Real Madrid, Makelele made 217 appearances for Chelsea, winning five major trophies including two Premier League titles and has one of the most enduring legacies of any footballer to play in England, with clubs now spending nine-figure sums to fill The Makelele Role, albeit for slightly more well-rounded players than the diminutive Frenchman.",
      "",
      "11) Michael Owen (Newcastle, £16.8m)\nThere’s a misconception that injuries stopped Owen from reaching the Premier League heights he enjoyed before moving to Real Madrid on his return to the English top flight. But he played 29 and 28 games in consecutive seasons for Newcastle and was just a bit balls, scoring 19 goals across the two.",
      "",
      "10) Danilo (Manchester City, £26.5m)\nWe would refer to Danilo as a rare misstep in the Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain era in a summer in which they also signed Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, who’ve done alright, but they somehow managed to make a £7.5m profit on the Brazilian after two years of not doing very much at all.",
      "",
      "9) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham, £25m)\nFor a famously miserly football chief, Daniel Levy does choose to spend Spurs’ money very strangely at times. He was entirely duped by five knockout games for Reguilon on loan at Sevilla to help them to the Europa League, and five years and 73 games after joining Spurs, the full-back is now without a club having left at the end of his contract.",
      "",
      "8) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal, £30m)\nOdegaard is presumably the recent example Rodrygo is hoping to mimic with his eyes on the Premier League. The playmaker was destined for great things when he signed for Madrid as a child but needed to leave to realise his potential, and while Rodrygo’s situation is different in that he’s proved he’s good enough for Real Madrid while still at Real Madrid, he will be attracted to a major role similar to Odegaard’s at a top English side.",
      "",
      "7) Raphael Varane (Manchester United, £40m)\nWe wonder whether Manchester United signing a centre-back with far more miles in his legs than his 28 years for £40m would be seen in more negative terms had it not been for his 30-year-old pal signing for £60m a year later.",
      "",
      "6) Robinho (Manchester City, £32.5m)\nQuite the 2008 deadline day for City, with Robinho arriving along with all the Abu Dhabi cash after their takeover of the club. The Brazilian announced his delight at signing for Chelsea in his first City press conference and manager Mark Hughes later claimed he believes he didn’t recognise him and was “expecting to see Sir Alex Ferguson at the airport”.",
      "",
      "5) Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea, £40m)\nThe ultimate close-but-no-cigar footballer in many ways as he’s never really been a key cog after leaving Inter for Real Madrid in 2015, as illustrated by him having four Champions League winners medals but not playing a single minute in the three for Real Madrid and just 10 minutes for Chelsea in 2021.",
      "",
      "4) Mesut Ozil (Arsenal, £42.5m)\nHe left Arsenal with a reputation of being work-shy, but mercurial may be a better description of an absurdly talented footballer who could do astonishing things with the ball at his feet but also often went missing in games, particularly at the end of his time at the Emirates. We’re not quite sure of the definition of a ‘streets won’t forget footballer’ but Ozil was somewhere between that and world class.",
      "",
      "3) Alvaro Morata (Chelsea, £58m)\nMorata has said he “stopped enjoying football” at Chelsea and that was pretty clear to everyone watching. “I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing.”",
      "",
      "2) Casemiro (Manchester United, £60m)\nThere was undoubtedly an uptick in Casemiro’s performances at the end of last season, but he had set a very low bar by his standards to hobble over and we are very amused by what looks to be a reasonably decent chance of him starting the coming season at the base of Ruben Amorim’s midfield after well over a season of desperation to be rid of him.",
      "",
      "1) Angel Di Maria (Manchester United, £59.7m)\nHe actually started very well, with three goals and six assists in his opening 10 Premier League games, and Amorim would bite your hand off for a forward with a goal contribution ever 126 minutes as Di Maria managed in his solitary season at Old Trafford.",
      "But he really didn’t get on with Louis van Gaal and his wife might be the only person in the world who hates Manchester more than Mr Di Maria.",
      "“The people are all pasty-faced, prim and proper… weird,” she said.",
      "“They’re walking down the street and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you or what. The food’s disgusting. All the girls are all dolled up to the nines, perfectly made-up and there’s me with my hair in a bun and with no make-up on.",
      "“We try to be closer when things go bad. I did not blame him for being there. I just told him, ‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it is already night at 14:00 p.m. in the afternoon.'”",
      "We’re guessing she preferred Paris like her husband, who got 92 goals and 120 assists while starring for PSG.",
      "Arsenal have ‘ruled out’ a move for Rodrygo this summer having agreed a deal for Eberechi Eze, to leave the Brazilian with ‘one possibility’ in the Premier League.",
      "Manchester United lost against Arsenal and now Sunday v Fulham is absolutely massive. Can they be Premier League title contenders?",
      "Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal shouldn’t be sleeping on Rodrygo. Apologies to Tottenham, but a hijack turns any of that inseparable trio into clear title favourites.",
      "Liverpool have reportedly made an ‘enquiry’ over a Fluminese midfielder while Rodrygo has held ‘talks’ over a move to Anfield this summer.",
      "There’s been a record spend in the Premier League this summer, but have you been paying attention to the transfers in Europe?",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘burst onto the scene’ to challenge Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City in the race to sign Real Madrid star Rodrygo."

      "There’s a top-of-the-table Premier League clash to enjoy at the earliest possible opportunity, while the Bundesliga’s brave new broadcasting era has us briefly intrigued.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Manchester City v Tottenham\nThe fixture computer has blessed us with a top-of-the-table clash at the earliest possible moment. Unless you consider Arsenal v Aston Villa on the very opening day such a thing, in which case you’re a damn fool. Even more so if you’re going to start indulging AFC Bournemouth and their Acme shenanigans in such alphabet-based nonsense.",
      "No, the second weekend of the season is the first time such a thing can legitimately happen, when you have a whole one game’s worth of compelling evidence of how the entire season might look, as long as every other team in the league is roughly as bad as Wolves and/or Burnley.",
      "Embryonic league table whimsy aside, it’s still a fascinating game. Historically, City v Spurs is already a fixture simply not to be missed by anyone for any reason. It has delivered goals, goals, goals and a frankly absurd number of pants-pullings by silly old Spurs.",
      "Last season’s 4-0 splattering was Spurs at their Angeball best against City in the very deepest depths of their astonishing season-wrecking autumn funk, but the wildest thing about that result is that it is only very slightly an outlier.",
      "Working backwards from that game, the Etihad encounters between these two during the Pep era have finished 0-4, 3-3, 4-2, 2-3, 3-0, 2-2, 1-0, 4-1 and 2-2. And let’s not forget that ludicrous Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2019, which City actually won 4-3 on the night as Spurs went through on away goals.",
      "It has been as close to guaranteed entertainment as the Premier League can offer. We’ve run it through the supercomputer and this fixture has the highest xN (expected nonsense) stats of any in the entire Barclays universe.",
      "And yet even without the fact it’s a top-of-the-table clash with sky-high xN values, it would still be the game of the weekend anyway for actual reasons. City looked a million dollars against Wolves last weekend, while Mohammed Kudus and Richarlison looked like absolute world-beaters for Spurs against Burnley.",
      "There were hugely encouraging signs for both teams’ seasons. But the phrases ‘against Wolves’ and ‘against Burnley’ mean care must be taken. We don’t yet really know how much of what we saw last weekend was these teams being good and those teams being rubbish. We have an inkling about which victory/performance was the more reliable long-term indicator, but we don’t yet know.",
      "We should have a far clearer idea about both teams after this game, even if it is one that itself has recent history for deception.",
      "Spurs, because they are Spurs, come into this game on the back of a week where they’ve once again decided to subject their fans to another of their trademark ritual humiliations for sh*ts and giggles, while also taking the bold step of unsettling and alienating the striker who scored two brilliant goals for them on the opening weekend. There really is nobody else who does it like Spurs do.",
      "But we already have a decent clue as to how Thomas Frank might set them up for this one. The Super Cup final ended in disappointment but for 85 minutes Frank’s 3-5-1-1 really did work strikingly well and if we’re honest we suspect Spurs would cheerfully take a 2-2 draw from this one.",
      "In a way, the transfer failings of this week and the summer as a whole make Frank’s job easier for this specific game. He can’t be accused of going too defensive when he has literally no No. 10 anyway.",
      "There seems no reason not to go to City and try the triple-pivot midfield that made life so awkward for PSG in Udine, while who doesn’t want to see Kevin Danso launching long throws at John Stones’ head?",
      "For City, it’s also a bit of a free hit in its ridiculous way. A sterner test than poor denuded Wolves could provide, surely, and one where a compelling victory would lay down a significant early-season marker about just how back they might be. But also one in which failure can just be shrugged off and put down to xN.",

      "Player to watch: Eberechi Eze\nA good way to endear yourself to a new club’s fanbase is to have completely pied off their biggest rivals along the way. Emmanuel Petit knew it. Willian knew it. Eden Hazard knew it. But perhaps nobody has ever known it quite like Eberechi Eze, who kept Spurs on the hook until Arsenal’s time of need was upon them.",
      "Spurs must have known this could happen, and that it would look just awful – especially in the wake of the Morgan Gibbs-White fiasco. We do think Eze would have joined Spurs, but we do think it would only have happened once he was absolutely definitely certain Arsenal weren’t coming back.",
      "The whole ‘Oh he just wants to play in the Conference League qualifier to help Palace out before he leaves’ turned out to be the bullsh*t it always appeared to be, a convenient way to drag a transfer out even when dealing with the arch transfer-dragger-out himself in Daniel Levy.",
      "The result is Eze being an absolute hero to Arsenal fans before he’s even kicked a ball for them. It’s a lovely place to be. And it’s distinctly possible he still won’t kick a ball this weekend, but he’s still going to be the player to watch.",
      "He’ll surely at the very least be presented to the crowd before Arsenal’s opening home game of the season against Leeds, and should help ensure a buoyant atmosphere. There will be songs. There will be p*ss-taking. There will be endless shots of Eze in the stands watching on and penny-for-his-thoughtsing from the commentators.",

      "Team to watch: Manchester United\nThere was a lot to like about Manchester United’s performance against Arsenal on the opening weekend, but any optimism from that narrow, unfortunate defeat will dissipate quickly if they don’t get a result at Fulham this weekend.",
      "United were simply unready and unprepared for the start of the new season, still stuck with the same utter absence of reliable goalkeepers. It is staggering to us how often really big clubs do this. The window may be open until September 1, but the start of the season is in mid-August, and those games do still count. It wasn’t sprung on United with no notice.",
      "Another week has passed and nothing has been done to address the most obvious and glaring of issues.",
      "Fulham were as lucky to nab a point at Brighton as United were unlucky to walk away with nothing against Arsenal, but they represent a deeply awkward second fixture given the way the first one has gone.",
      "Fulham away is nobody’s idea of an easy game. It is not one where victory would normally necessarily be mandatory. But for United, after last season and the way the opening weekend panned out, it already feels like one where the result is of far greater importance than performance.",
      "This is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. You can’t be taking the positives if you find yourself with one point or worse from two games after finishing 15th the previous season and when the flaws in your squad are and remain so very, very obvious.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: David Moyes\nIt will be a proud moment when Moyes leads his Everton team out against Brighton for the first ever Premier League match at their magnificent new stadium, but one that he surely approaches now with a touch of trepidation.",
      "The wave of optimism he and Everton rode on his return to the club last season has crashed, and Monday night’s effort at Leeds was a pretty pitiful one for an established Premier League club against a newly-promoted one.",
      "Everton were passive and ponderous, allowing Leeds to set the tone and tempo of the game throughout. It nearly delivered a point – although for what it’s worth we simply cannot understand the fuss around the penalty given the way James Tarkowski moved his arm towards a ball coming at him from such a distance – but it wasn’t exactly a showing to inspire confidence for the season ahead.",
      "A new stadium is blessing and curse, with home advantage no longer quite the familiar helping hand it once was as everyone gets used to the new surroundings. Yet Everton and Moyes cannot afford to make a slow start to life on the docks if the club is to avoid the kind of worries and anxiety that have been all too common in recent Premier League seasons.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Charlton v Leicester\nIt’s not been a convincing start to life back in the Championship for Leicester, who needed a late goal to beat existential dread’s Sheffield Wednesday at home and then lost at Preston having also gone out of the Carabao to League One Huddersfield.",
      "Charlton, meanwhile, are at this early stage faring rather better on their own return to the second tier from the other direction having beaten Watford, drawn with Bristol City and avoided Carabao banana skins (their newest flavour of surely deliberately undrinkably unpleasant energy drink).",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig\nWe don’t normally include Friday night games in here, but come on. Bayern v Leipzig would be a fine opening night Bundesliga game in a regular season. But now it comes with added Mark Goldbridge. You have to admit you’re intrigued.",
      "You can watch it on the BBC as well if you like, or on YouTube. But out of sheer morbid fascination if nothing else we’ll be watching to see just how and how quickly the world’s most Deliberate Partridge performatively perma-furious internet ragebaiter manages to make Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig all about Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",

      "It’s still all about Alexander Isak and there have been ‘bombshells’ aplenty after words from both Arne Slot and Eddie Howe.",
      "Manchester United are being linked with a midfielder many people are pretending they know all about, while there is an agent-made buzz around Rodrygo and half of the Big Six…",

And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",

      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",

      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",

      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",

      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",

Our crystal ball says: season-long loan somewhere in La Liga.",

      "43) Ahmed Abdullahi (Sunderland)\nInjury wrecked his first season on Wearside and Regis Le Bris was apparently keen to at least give him a pre-season chance to show his worth. We’ll have a definitive verdict on that over the next week or so.",

      "23) Reiss Nelson (Arsenal)\nArsenal would like to sell him, Fulham would like to have him back.

It screams loan-with-option on September 1, frankly.",

      "22) Mike Tresor (Burnley)\nRestricted to one substitute appearance in the FA Cup across the whole of last season. It’s just never quite happened for the winger at Turf Moor and having been prominently involved in pre-season was nowhere to be seen in the matchday squad at Tottenham, suggesting a departure over the next couple of weeks is surely the likely outcome here.",

      "21) Ethan Pinnock (Brentford)\nHas seen it all across six years at Brentford and you’d imagine he remains a welcome familiar sight after a summer of upheaval and flux for the Bees. Played 32 matches in Brentford’s first Premier League season, then 30, 29 and 22 in the subsequent three. No great surprise to see those numbers continue on that trend this season, but he was still on the bench for every game he was available last term.",

      "20) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nCurrently sat with his trotters up on close to 200 grand a week. You can only be so miffed about that. Chelsea’s transfer policy is not his fault, and he’s another one whose wildly generous contract terms make him extremely awkward to shift no matter how surplus to requirements he becomes.",
      "",
      "19) Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nDoes appear among the more shiftable of the 25/26 Chelsea bomb squad. Spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and there must surely be a Premier League suitor out there that works for all parties. Also not one of the Chelsea outcasts on the very daftest money, putting him within the wage structure of most non-crazy Premier League clubs. Most obviously and necessarily Bournemouth given the scale of their defensive losses this summer.",
      "",
      "18) Albert Sambi Lokonga (Arsenal)\nSevilla didn’t take up the option to make his loan permanent at the end of last season, so Lokonga is back in career limbo. They’re not Man United-level, but Arsenal are low-key bad at getting fringe players out the door.",

      "16) Illan Meslier (Leeds)\nHigh-profile errors last season didn’t cost Leeds in the end, but have cost Meslier. Firmly replaced as first choice by Lucas Perri and not even on the bench against Everton. A return to France seems the likeliest outcome here.",
      "",
      "15) Jadon Sancho (Man United)\nEverything appears to be agreed with Roma for a loan-with-obligation, and we’re not quite sure what Sancho is waiting for as his ill-fated United career meanders to an acrimonious close. We should all be hacked off at this waste of an obvious talent, but not sure where exactly Sancho can reasonably now direct his own ire without asking himself uncomfortable questions.",

      "14) Konstantinos Tsimikas (Liverpool)\nNow behind Milos Kerkez as well as Andy Robertson in the left-back pecking order at Anfield, with Fulham, Leeds and Nottingham Forest all keen to offer him a more straightforward route to Premier League minutes, but he could yet be retained at Liverpool for squad depth purposes.",
      "",
      "13) Tyrell Malacia (Man United)\nPart of the bloated United Bomb Squad, but not perhaps a villain in the same way as certain other members of that cohort. Malacia’s crime, such as it is, is to be not quite good enough. He also wasn’t quite good enough for PSV, where he spent the second half of last season on loan.",
      "",
      "12) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nHas made over 100 Premier League appearances for the Seagulls and signed a one-year contract extension in the summer, but could yet move on before the window closes. Everton have been sniffing around, by all accounts.",
      "",
      "11) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nLooks certain to join the Brighton exodus; the only question is where, for how long, and/or for how much. The list of clubs reportedly interested is a long and glamorous one with Spurs, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Roma and also, in fairness, Leeds, West Ham and Forest all credited with interest of some sort or other in the Argentine playmaker this summer.",
      "",
      "10) Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea)\nChelsea are holding out for a permanent sale, and want somewhere close to the £40m release clause in his contract.

      "8) Antony (Man United)\nDesperately wants to return to Real Betis, where he enjoyed himself so much on loan last season, and is clearly willing to wait until the very last minute if necessary to give that move every chance of coming to fruition, no matter how much United might have preferred a swifter solution.",
      "",
      "7) Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nFulham, Porto, Fenerbahce and Real Betis have all been linked but no solution appears imminent for the Ukrainian as he enters the final year of his Arsenal contract.",
      "",
      "6) Rasmus Hojlund (Man United)\nErik Ten Hag continues to haunt Manchester United, apparently closing off one exit route for Hojlund by selling Victor Boniface to one-time Hojlund-suitors Milan. Surely someone somewhere must want a striker who doesn’t really score goals but runs about a bit while secretly being far taller than you expect.",
      "",
      "5) Ben Chilwell (Chelsea)\nA member of last year’s bomb squad and back hanging around the training ground after Crystal Palace opted against making his loan move permanent. Genuinely quite daft from all concerned this hasn’t been sorted out more swiftly and permanently.",
      "",
      "4) Patrick Bamford (Leeds)\nHas been told he is not in Daniel Farke’s plans and is free to find a new club with just a year left on his contract. Leeds’ understandable concerns around Bamford’s injury history are nevertheless slightly dented by signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin as his direct replacement.",
      "",
      "3) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\n‘We’ve made a decision that he’s not available after a very disrupted pre-season,’ was future-Sporcle-scupperer Keith Andrews’ statement ahead of the Nottingham Forest game. “I’ve been very clear on the situation as head coach: I want Yoane in the building.” But not, at this time, on the pitch. Has probably played his last game for the club.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nNo shame in being unable to shift William Saliba or Gabriel Magalhaes from the starting XI, but slipping behind Cristhian Mosquera and out of the full-strength matchday squad altogether might sharpen Kiwior’s focus on finding a new club. Although, funnily enough, also didn’t make the matchday squad on the opening day last season, before being in every single one of the remaining 37, so maybe it’s fine actually.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle)\nWe’ve scoured the internet and can find no mention of Isak anywhere, meaning his absence from the opening-day draw with Aston Villa is a complete mystery. Perhaps some things man is not meant to know.",
      "He can be – and is – very pissed off indeed that he’s missing the start of this season, but should really be aiming almost every drop of that boiled piss in a different direction.",

      "United have attempted to shift some players off the books who are surplus to requirements this summer. They got Marcus Rashford out on loan, to Barcelona, but the likes of Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are still at the club.",
      "Should they sell each of those players, they should make a decent sum of money, to potentially but some new talent.",
      "They have also been looking into a midfield signing since improving their attack, but the lack of available funds has hindered their pursuit of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, while Crystal Palace don’t want to sell Adam Wharton.",

      "The Red Devils want £50million, while their Premier League rivals don’t want to pay more than £30million.",
      "But to potentially bring the price down and add a midfield star to their ranks, transfer insider Ben Jacobs has suggested that United asked for Andrey Santos.",
      "He said on The United Stand: “What I can tell you is that when discussions have been ongoing for Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, Andrey Santos has been spoken about.",
      "“I don’t think it’s going to lead anywhere, because Chelsea don’t want to sell. That’s another player, though, that Manchester United appreciate. It’s nothing more than that at this stage.”",
      "It is unsurprising that Chelsea don’t want to lose Santos. After going out on loan to Strasbourg last season, where he scored 10 Ligue 1 goals and assisted four more, he played four times in the Club World Cup for the Blues in the summer, assisting once, and came off the bench in this season’s Premier League opener.",
      "Reports earlier in the summer suggested that West Ham had approached Chelsea over the potential £45million transfer of Santos, but were turned away as Enzo Maresca’s side see a lot of promise in the Brazilian midfielder.",
      "That will leave United sweating that they’ll have to let Garnacho go to Stamford Bridge for a cut-price fee, as Ruben Amorim doesn’t want him, needs cash, and currently Chelsea are the only side who are in for him, but won’t budge.",
      "A recent report has stated the Red Devils have given Tottenham the green light to make an approach for Garnacho, as drumming up some extra interest might mean the winger’s price rises and Chelsea don’t get an easy deal.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly picked out their ‘dream target’ from another Premier League side, and the star man is open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "United have been very active in the summer window. They have spent over £200million so far, with more than half of that going on Premier League stars Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Red Devils are clearly eager to ensure they can compete in the Premier League – after a 15th-placed finish last season – by landing experienced talents.",
      "That is also true of Carlos Baleba, who has had two good seasons in English football, but United are seemingly aware the signing of the £100million-plus-rated midfielder is not plausible right now.",
      "As such, our friends at TEAMtalk report the Red Devils have picked out a different ‘dream target,’ also from within the Premier League.",
      "United have long been known to be admirers of Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, and it’s said they dream of bringing him to Old Trafford.",
      "They have been given positive signs in that pursuit, as it’s reported Wharton would be open to a move to United, where he is drawn due to their storied history, and the vision of boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The manager himself is said to see the midfielder as ideal for his system, offering vision and control in midfield.",
      "Though he’d be open to joining, the report also states Wharton is ‘deeply respectful’ of Palace. The Eagles themselves are also in no rush to sell the midfielder, who has played 45 times for them since joining from Blackburn in January 2024.",
      "His contract runs until 2029, and as a result, Palace know they are in a very strong negotiating position, and could demand upwards of £60million.",
      "That, though, has not deterred United. The report states there has been a caution that it would be ‘unwise’ to rule out a formal approach from the Red Devils before the window closes.",
      "However, similar was said about Baleba, and for this summer at least, things seem to have died down.",
      "Indeed, it’s been known that United are going to struggle to finance deals without sales this summer, and with essentially no money being made, they have been unable to lodge a bid for Baleba.",
      "Though it looks as if Wharton will cost £40million or so less than the Brighton man, the Red Devils might well still struggle to finance that deal this summer in their current state.",
      "Real Madrid could complicate Premier League transfer plans this summer with a move for a sought-after Crystal Palace star.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing to invest’ around £130m to ‘close two signings’, while they plot a move for a Real Madrid star.",
      "After their pursuit of Carlos Baleba went cold, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has given his old club another target they should go after.",
      "Xabi Alonso has his eye on two Premier League midfielders as Real Madrid ‘open the door’ to a double swoop which would cost Los Blancos £142m.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly the ‘favourites’ to land the Crystal Palace star, who’s ‘ready to wait’ for a Reds bid rather than moving to Tottenham.",

      "\"For me, the only way to protect myself and my players it to tell them not to see anything.",
      "\"You have to be like a monk, especially when you have problems and then I try to present the facts because sometimes there is a narrative that is not true.",
      "\"Altay made one mistake, but last year he had very good performances, so I try to tell that to the players and then try to battle that narrative.",

      "Yes, there is some hesitancy to believe that after previous managers and false dawns, but there does seem to be genuine optimism after the re-opening of their training ground, new and exciting players joining the club and a positive first performance against Arsenal.",
      "Amorim said: \"Last year, sometimes I was worried going to the games, but now I'm excited, it is completely different.\"",
      "\"We suffered together so much (last season) and that can bond people - the spirit is really good.\"",

      "Manchester United face Fulham on Super Sunday hoping to build on the positives from their narrow loss to Arsenal. Bryan Mbeumo's performance was one of them. His debut, following a strong pre-season, underlined his potential to transform their attack.",
      "It could be seen in his very first actions of the game.",
      "Inside the opening minute, Mbeumo controlled a looping clearance in his own half then drove Manchester United deep into Arsenal territory on the break. Soon afterwards, he was latching onto a Bruno Fernandes through-ball and testing David Raya.",
      "Manchester United ended up dominating possession against one of the Premier League's top teams for the first time in a decade. It was when attacking quickly and directly, though, that they looked most dangerous. Matheus Cunha helped but Mbeumo was key.",
      "Last season, Manchester United directed a far higher percentage of attacks down the left than the right but the emphasis switched completely against Arsenal as they looked for Mbeumo at every opportunity. The former Brentford winger is their outlet now.",
      "He finished the game having had more shots than any other player. He ranked top for touches in the opposition box and dribbles too. But it is his movement that makes it all possible.",
      "Mbeumo made more attacking runs than anyone else in the division at Brentford last season and he occupied the same spot in the rankings on the opening weekend of the new campaign.",
      "The 26-year-old has given Manchester United a new level of running power. His total of 30 attacking runs in his very first appearance for the club was only bettered by Manchester United players on five occasions in the whole of last season in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim has said since his appointment last year that he wants his side to have more possession and thereby more control. But increasing their threat on the counter and on transitions is also seen as crucial. It is already clear that Mbeumo makes it possible.",
      "Against Arsenal, Manchester United totalled four direct attacks and three fast breaks, a combined total beaten only by Liverpool and Bournemouth on the opening weekend and a significant increase on the side's averages under Amorim last season.",
      "The trouble, of course, was that they were unable to make them count. The next challenge is to find a ruthless edge, starting at Craven Cottage. But Mbeumo's impact is evident, even after one game. Manchester United have glimpsed what they can become.",
      "Matt O'Riley assumed penalty-taking duties for Brighton against Fulham last weekend following Joao Pedro's departure to Chelsea. Playing in the No 10 role vacated by the Brazilian, he offered a similar level of off-the-ball industry too.",
      "His total of 66 pressures in the 1-1 draw with Marco Silva's side was the eighth-highest among Premier League players on the opening weekend. Crucially, O'Riley offered quality as well as quantity. No player made more pressures leading to turnovers. His industry helped create opportunities for Brighton to hurt Fulham.",
      "Fabio Hurzeler praised his all-round contribution afterwards. \"He is doing a lot of work out of possession, so we are not only happy to have him because of the goal,\" he said. The Brighton boss will hope for more of the same from him against Everton on Super Sunday.",
      "Injuries made it difficult for O'Riley to showcase those physical qualities anything like as much as he would have liked in his first season at Brighton following his £25m arrival from Celtic last year. He was limited to only 11 starts in the Premier League.",
      "But despite interest from Italian clubs Napoli, Atalanta and Roma this summer, the early evidence this season suggests the club would be wise to keep hold of him as they adapt to life without his former team-mate, off the ball as well as on it.",
      "Nottingham Forest have lost Anthony Elanga but they have gained Dan Ndoye. The 24-year-old marked his debut with a goal against Brentford and could cause Crystal Palace problems next.",
      "The opening column of the season featured analysis of Martin Zubimendi's Arsenal role, Matheus Cunha's potential to help Patrick Dorgu thrive, and Ismaila Sarr's value to Crystal Palace.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Saturday 23 August 2025 12:42, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Fulham will inflict another defeat on Man Utd on Sunday.",
      "Here's a sentence that would have made absolutely zero sense this time last year: Tottenham are becoming a serious set-piece threat.",
      "Under Ange Postecoglou it was all vibes and vertical football, but under Thomas Frank there's good reason to believe Spurs could evolve into a set-piece machine. Brentford ranked second for expected goals from such situations last season in the Premier League and the early signs are positive for Spurs' ability to create havoc in the same vein.",
      "Hello, Micky van de Ven.",
      "He's not just a Rolls Royce in open play and with the ball - his power, pace, and timing make him an aerial asset waiting to be unlocked from attacking corners and free-kicks. In two starts under Frank, he's already amassed three shots and a goal against PSG.",
      "He is 6/4 with Sky Bet to register at least one shot and while the markets remain sleeping on the true probability, he is a great bet to attack.",
      "If you wanted some evidence about how much Brentford have potentially fallen in the summer, analysing their win price in the last meeting between these two clubs in March says a lot. The Bees, with Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Yoane Wissa in tow, were 11/10 shots to beat Aston Villa at home.",
      "They are priced up as 21/10 here just five months later, which indicates almost a five per cent implied probability shift.",
      "That's massive when assessing outright prices.",
      "They were utterly hopeless in the first half of their 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest. First day nerves to blame? Or more a deeper underlying issue that this is a bigger rebuilding job than the club first imagined? I'm in the latter camp.",
      "Sometimes in football betting, you just have to go back to basics.",
      "Squad downgrade? Check. Squad imbalance? Check. Dangerous opponents who have one of the best managers in Europe? Check.",
      "All signs point to a Bournemouth win over Wolves this weekend at 4/5 with Sky Bet - and this could be a bleak season for Vítor Pereira's men.",
      "At home, with the crowd behind them and Wolves trying to implement Pereira's possession-based patterns under pressure, this game sets up nicely for Andoni Iraola's side and the fast and frenetic Bournemouth style. The Cherries may just squeeze Wolves into errors and feast on transitions. They may have lost a lot of quality in their dressing room but the most important man remains: Iraola - as shown by their performance at Anfield.",
      "That's why they can be trusted to go again despite the squad overhaul.",
      "The Premier League has become a league where pace, power, directness and ability to have real physicality off the ball is so key. This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "I think Sunderland have noticed this trend and spent all summer planning to join the fast-break party because their recruitment has centred around bringing in big strong boys who either have lots of physical presence or carry great pace and power. They were so good on the break in the 3-0 win over West Ham. It was all about energy and progressive running.",
      "Habib Diarra was the real star - this kid is powerful and full of direct running forward. Regis Le Bris gave him lots of license to support the front man and he fired in two shots, one of which was defined a big chance. He's 6/5 with Sky Bet to hit two or more shots again in a game Sunderland will be targeting three points from.",
      "Beware: Declan Rice is a player I'll be rabbiting on about a lot this season.",
      "Since moving to Arsenal, Rice has evolved into more than just a midfield shield. Under Mikel Arteta, he's given license to step into advanced pockets, recycle possession and let fly when space opens up. This positional change makes him a fantastic betting prospect in the attacking props markets.",
      "Rice has covered his two or more shots line in his last six starts and boats an overall shots figure of 2.15 when playing in the No 8 role in 2025.",
      "That figure should be capable of being hit against against a newly-promoted team, where Arsenal will dominate territory and Rice finds himself with time to test the 'keeper or pepper the goal. Combining Arsenal to win and Rice to have two or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet looks a nice angle to attack.",
      "My first port of call whenever a key player leaves or suffers a serious injury is the with and without data to try and quantify how much a team will miss that player's output. Well, since the start of the 23/24 season, Eberechi Eze - on his way to Arsenal - hasn't started 21 games in the Premier League and in that time Palace's win percentage goes from 40 per cent to 19 per cent and their points per game drops from 1.5 to just 1.0 per game.",
      "Oliver Glasner has a difficult job in keeping confidence and mentality levels high within his squad after losing such an important and well-liked player.",
      "Forest are a trustworthy team as you know exactly what you're going to get in that they're very good in both boxes, and are led impeccably by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo in defence - one of the best defensive pairings in Europe.",
      "This looks a great time to head to Selhurst Park and the away win at 21/10 with Sky Bet does appeal.",
      "One lazy narrative that has stuck out during the pre-season chat is how Everton could struggle without the fortress of Goodison Park and may suffer from new stadium nerves. However, the last five teams in the top two tiers of English football that have moved stadiums possess a healthy record across their first five games.",
      "From those 25 games, they won 16 of them, losing just four.",
      "Hill Dickinson Stadium has been strategically built to keep the atmosphere hot and hostile and when Everton fans turn up the noise, they remain one of the most passionate set of fans in the country. Brighton are a team overrated by the markets in my view and the 19/10 with Sky Bet on Everton starting with a win at their new home looks a solid wager.",
      "The market likes what it saw from Manchester United against Arsenal based on their win price here. They are 21/20 with Sky Bet although it doesn't feel like particularly smart money is driving the United price into what it is. They still looked very timid in central midfield without the ball and doubts remain about whether the wing-backs - a key cog in any 3-5-2 system - provide enough attacking output to turn United into a functional and exciting team.",
      "I like backing Fulham when they are overlooked. Marco Silva's men are mostly ignored by the market but they took 30 of their 54 points last season against top-half teams. That's a huge return and one that made them very profitable to back as outsiders when the price was right. You can get 6/4 with Sky Bet here on Fulham on the draw no bet market meaning stakes are refunded if the game ends level.",
      "Eddie Howe is doing a great job at using the Alexander Isak situation to bring the club together as best he can.",
      "When St James' Park smells disrespect, it bites back. You can expect the atmosphere to be a bearpit on Monday. Every Liverpool touch booed. Newcastle players pumped to play aggressively from the first whistle as they look to utilise that hotbed of noise to their advantage.",
      "And that's when the Toon are at their most dangerous.",
      "Despite the win vs Bournemouth, Liverpool appeared more vulnerable on the break than last season as they faced more fast breaks (5) in that game than in any Premier League game at Anfield last season.",
      "And Newcastle are built to counter-attack with a front three of Anthony Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes perfectly equipped to hit Liverpool in transition. The hosts look a great bet in the double chance market at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",

      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",

      "Special mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.",
      "There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.",

      "He needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.",
      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",
      "I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.",

      "DERMOT SAYS: This is the law. If a wall is set up with three or more players, opposition players have to be a metre from it. Often you see forwards standing in front of the wall. In this case, Guehi is stood between two players.",
      "Where they set up, Guehi initially is not deemed to be in the wall, he's between two players to the right of the wall, but as the ball is kicked, Guehi's movement is towards Caicedo and without doubt, he's not a metre from it.",
      "The IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\n\n\n\"If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.\"",
      "You don't see it often. Most free kicks don't result in a goal, and because this one does, VAR has to check it.",
      "It was all about Caicedo moving into the wall and Guehi being in contact with him.",
      "The genie is out the bottle now.",
      "Micah Richards said: \"There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.\"",
      "Roy Keane added: \"Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.",
      "\"Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Senesi avoids punishment after appearing to handle the ball as the last defender.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: I think this is a really interesting situation. The VAR, for me, has looked at it too quickly and cleared it.",
      "I think he's seen the ball fly up off Senesi and has not watched the second part.",
      "He's seen the ball hit the elbow off the knee and stopped looking, he hasn't looked for the second swipe. If he sends the referee to the screen, the referee has all options. He probably sends Senesi off because Huge Ekitike is going to be away. The only doubt is, is it too far from goal? But this is a class forward.",
      "If it goes to the screen he would have been sent off. It was a mistake and fortunately it didn't affect the outcome of the game.",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher on how referee Anthony Taylor deal with the incident involving Antoine Semenyo at Anfield:\n\n\n\"Firstly, it's terrible what happened.\n\n\n\"However, from the referee's point of view, absolutely first class.\n\n\nWhat I really liked was he got both managers together really quickly and explained what had happened.\n\n\n\"They identified where it came from and it was dealt with really quickly.\n\n\n\"The referee was first class because he kept everyone aware of what he was doing. he made it very apparent that protocol was followed and the fourth official was noting everything down.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Burnley goalkeeper Dubravka gets penalised for holding the ball for more than eight seconds, resulting in an opposition corner.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: If you watch, he does take too long. I get a bit concerned with the eight seconds, because we don't want to have to get the stop watch out. But he's making no attempt to release the ball.",
      "It's a deterrent. That's why the rule is there. No referee wants to have to apply that rule, they want goalkeepers to get rid of the ball and keep the game moving faster.",
      "\"I don't know why he's holding onto the ball for so long, it's about 12 seconds.\"",

      "Liverpool, Arsenal and Man City are tipped for a tight Premier League title race but what Ruben Amorim can achieve with Man Utd divided the pundits, while Erling Haaland and Florian Wirtz were among the players picked to shine as Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville made their predictions...",
      "By Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville",
      "Tuesday 19 August 2025 18:34, UK",
      "Speaking on Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville made their 2025/26 Premier League season predictions.",
      "Gary Neville - Arsenal (but it's too close to call)",
      "I couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool. I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it.",
      "Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.",
      "Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "City have an unbelievable spine.",
      "I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.",
      "Jamie Carragher - Liverpool, ahead of Man City",
      "What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",
      "Neville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves",
      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",
      "Carragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "It's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.",
      "Neville - Adrien Truffert",
      "I was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.",
      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.",
      "Carragher - Oliver Glasner",
      "I think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.",
